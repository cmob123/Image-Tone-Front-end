He owns several hundred and has them displayed all across Playtone (his production office). They are all in pristine condition and don't look like they've aged a day. 

His entire production office is loaded up with fantastic memorabilia. Lots of pop culture and incredible pieces from the forties, fifties, and sixties. The man's loaded with taste and class.

And as you may well know he happens to be one of the nicest, kindest, most genuine guys in the business.

    Dear Chris, Ashley, and all the diabolical genuies at Nerdist Industries.

    Just who do you think you are to try to briibe me into an appearance on your
    'thing' with this gift of the most fantastic Cornona Silent typewriter made in 1934?

    You are out of your minds if you think... that I... wow, this thing has great action...
    and this deep crimson color... Wait! I'm not so shallow as to... and it types nearly
    silently...

    Oh, OKAY!

    I will have my people contact yours ad work out some kind of interview process...

    Damn you all to hell,

http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/nerdist-podcast-tom-hanks/Tom's episode of the podcast was one of the best in recent memory. Nothing will top the Henry Rollins episode, though. That shit was a revelation.Not sure if this was it, but in case I'm not the only one curious about what the [typewriter](https://www.smithcorona.com/blog/smith-corona-virtual-typewriter-museum/post-merger-office-machines-interwar-period/) looked like.Awesome post, but just curious... how in the hell does this have over 10,000 *net* upvotes??? The most I've ever seen is like, maybe 3000 or 4000, and generally the top posts on the front page have about 2000, right? Isn't there some sort of algorithm that balances out ridiculous amounts of upvotes with downvotes or something?That is classy sir. Straight up Classy.Im not even going to whore my username for karma, I just want to say Tom Hanks is the greatest American Actor to ever live.
We should print his face on money.Looks like your invitation was just his type.I call Shenanigans: That signature clearly says ""Tom Hanly"".

I read the entire thing in his voice.And what a podcast it was. Good job Nerdist. My goal of hearing Tom Hanks tell funny stories was realized and made last night a pretty good one.

We got on the train, and all fell asleep pretty quickly. I was first to wake up and I was quick to notice that although we were still moving, it was very slow and dark. I looked out the window and down the train, and to my amazement the fucking train was being put into a big cruise ship. I quickly nudged my buddies awake, and as any engineering major would do, they all instantly sprung an infrastructure boner. We were flabbergasted. Our train is going into a boat this is insane. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any cooler, they let everyone out of the train to walk around the ship, grab a bite to eat, have a cigarette and stretch your legs. The best part though, was hitting the duty free shop and getting a bunch of booze for the rest of the trip. I don't know if that's a normal mode of transportation in Europe or even in the U.S. but it was the first time I had seen it and I was blown away.In addition to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel already described, the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel also has the same configuration.  Here's a picture of it [EDIT: actually, with thanks to /u/chasetwisters for the clarification, a picture of its next-door neighbor bridge-tunnel the MMBT, see below for the real image].

""Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridge–tunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels.""

So, if you like these, and you live in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area, you have your choice of two [EDIT: or, really, three] bridge-tunnels.

I caused the death of spider today and I've not been able to shake the whole ordeal from my head.

You see, I was driving in my car and I see something in my peripheral vision. It's a huge golden orb-weaver. A BANANA SPIDER! He's on my window, the inside, and he's looking at me and I'm looking at him and the cop behind me is looking at both of us and wondering why I'm not driving because the light is now green.

I rolled down my window but that didn't do any good. Spider just hopped down to my arm rest. Too close for comfort. I open my door a little bit but Spider can't take a hint.

WHOOP WHOOOOOOP. The cop is now pulling us over. I turn into a near by parking lot, spider clumsily bolts out of my car via the rolled down window, officer approaches my vehicle and says ""What're you doing, son?!"", I hear a crunch.

The Caiyuanba Bridge is an arch bridge which crosses the Yangtze River in Chongqing, China. Completed in 2007, the arch spans 420 metres (1,380 ft) ranking among the longest arch bridges in the world. The bridges carries 6 lanes of traffic and two track of Chongqing Rail Transit Line 3 between the Nan'an District south of the Yangtze River and the Yuzhong District to the north.

PS:  great photoPsh ... I climbed Mt. Fuji for the *first* time last week and [got this pic](http://i.imgur.com/32d3ZBF.jpg). Let's call it a tie.I climbed it last week when I was visiting Japan.  It was one day before the supposed typhoon.  Was at the summit at 4:30am and it was just a massive fog.  No light came through so no good shots could be had...  Got some great night shots on the tripod but no sun rise.Hey, really nice shot! [I got a similar result on Mt. Meru in Tanzania](http://i.imgur.com/QOMhvx4.jpg). I had clouds though :(When I climbed Fuji many years ago there was an old man right at the top (somehow connected to the Udon shop up there) and when he saw our foreign faces he laughed at us and said:

""Wise man climbs Mt. Fuji... Only fool climbs Mt. Fuji twice!"".

I wish I could see the signature, as I likely know the doctor in question!

My own GP hates requests for sick notes. I once called in sick a single time in a six month period, and was asked for a note. Spitefully, my GP wrote me off for three weeks in a glorious August, filling in the ""reason for absence"" section as ""None of your goddamn business. Confidentiality trumps bullshit policy."" That was the last time I was asked for a sick note.
 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! If you ever need health care in Halifax I'll be sure you get a real saline drip, not the bagged harbour water were usually use!Yep I just show up sick, do a really half-assed job, spread the illness around then go home. The American way.This is the perfect way to deal with that kind of policy.

Calm and understanding tone to maintain rapport. Expose the extra work and problems it causes. Mirror the absurdity by requiring an equally useless piece of work from them. Invoice them for the unnecessary cost. Appeal to the sense of community they (probably unknowingly) betray by outsourcing the cost of their organizational distrust for employees to other businesses.

Great lesson in diplomacy, right here.I do find it kind of silly that companies require a Doctors note if you are sick.

My company does this and I always cringe when I have to tell the employee that policy requires a doctors note if they call in sick more than a day or two.
If someone has the flu, stay the hell home. I don't care, we'll figure shit out.
Sure if you tell me you have a physical injury, I need a note and instructions from your doctor on what you can do when you get back for those who have positions that require physical labour, but if you just had the flu? Stay the hell home, I don't really care.
In the end most of them are paid hourly, if it isn't busy season...you are saving me money.
It's more of a deterrent for people who BS sick days, but it doesn't really work there either. Since they'll find a doctor to fill that stuff out regardless, so you're just wasting everyones time.

My dad used to work in an ER in Nova Scotia. He said it was completely fucked. So many people with very minor issues clogging everything up.Years ago I was a server and the flu hit me while I was working Handling food, drinks, silverware... GM sent me home seeing for himself I was really sick and said don't come in tomorrow. I was supposed to work the following 3 days. I did not show up the next day but by the third I was feeling better and came in. 

The MOD asked for my doctors note. I did not go to the doc nor could I afford the $150 to go to the walk-in clinic. She fired me on the spot leaving the floor short a server. 

The GM called 4 days later asking me WTF? I explained everything to him and he fired the MOD. 

EDIT: GM did not call me 4 days later but 4 days after the initial ""go home you're sick"". 1 day after the firing.Good on that doctor. Fantastic. I remember waiting with my wife in a walk-in clinic for four hours so she could be seen for 2 minutes so she could buy a note from the doctor's office for a flu. Biggest waste of time ever, but her company required itI got written up at an old job for refusing to give them a note. It was worth it to me- I'm not going to the doctor for a migraine, there's nothing they can do, it's just going to cost me more money on top of the money I'm losing by being unable to work.Whats even stranger is friends and family telling me to see a doctor. Its a fucking cold!That's the most Canadian ""fuck you"" I've ever seen. Bravo. Sick notes are for teenagers in high school, not middle aged employees. And they're nonsense anyway. I know what a 24hr stomach virus looks like. I know I don't need a doctor for it. Why the heck should I drag myself to a doctor's office unnecessarily just to appease my company's paranoia.I work in a hospital, and the policy here is essentially ""come in sick or it counts against you"".  Obviously, they don't say that, and they don't want us to work while sick, but they still ding you for calling out (even with a doctor's note).

So, we work around sick patients, which means we're likely to get sick, and we're less likely to call out, so we're likely to make our co-workers sick.  The whole thing is stupid.Instead of asking medical note because of abuse of sick leave benefit, why don't companies hire people they trust? 

If you trust your employees so little that you need to treat them like liars when they call in sick then you need to reconsider your hiring practices.Good for that doctor. I despise the sick note policies that so many companies have.  

I was once so sick with the flu that I genuinely couldn't get out of bed to go see my doctor to get a note, so I went back a couple of days later when I was feeling better to ask her for the note my manager required. I obviously wasn't sick anymore, so she just asked me what dates I was sick and wrote the note accordingly.  

So clearly it doesn't matter if I'm actually sick or not, as long as my doctor will vouch for me. But I have to be a drain on the healthcare system either way. I worked for a retail art supply store, and they brought in a new manager who decided to implement a similar policy of requiring a note if you called in sick.  I told him it cost money and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket for something like that, especially because I had already lost a days wages (no sick days), and was only making $8.50/hour.  He said that I wouldn't be re-imbursed, so I said ""no"".  Nothing more was said. I like the doctors note though, anything which put the responsiblity for such a paternalistic, and wasteful policy back on the employer. 

Its ironic isn't it, an employer generally wants a note to make sure the employee isn't being irresponsible and playing hooky; but the reality is that the request itself is far more irresponsible in its actual effect when you consider the extra strain it puts on the health care system.  

TL; DR= The dr. nailed it.I'm sorry, but screw demanding doctors' notes unless it's an extended illness.

""Oh, you're feeling sick today? NOW YOU MUST GO OUT OF YOUR HOME INSTEAD OF RESTING UP AND PAY A $50 COPAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING SICK.""

How about, if you don't trust your employees enough to believe them when they call in, you're a moron for employing them?I was home due to chicken pox this week and last week.

I work in IT, specifically as a senior DBA. I told them I would be out for 2 weeks but would be fully capable of working from home.

The following happened:

 - Boss required me to bring in a doctor's note with the diagnosis and expected return date.
 - Did not give me permission to work from home (yet made the expectation of such clear)
 - Made it quite clear that, in no uncertain terms, if I didn't have a note, I'd be dismissed for work abandonment.

I informed said boss that so long as I was chewing up sick time, I would not, for any reason what-so-ever, log into the VPN. At no point would I answer any pages nor emergency alerts. I informed him he was welcome to talk to HR / Legal about my stance and who was in the right.

This is the week that the cluster decided to have problems.

I can't wait to tell him that in another week I'm going to be out again for a gall bladder removal.

Like a dimestore hooker without any customers.If my job search is any indication this letter will never get read by any human person and the Dr. will get an automated reply saying ""thank you for applying but the position has already been filled.""Yeah that's bullshit. You're not a fucking child. Funniest part about sick notes is 99% of the time I'm sick because of the poor sanitation policies around your nasty work place.Problem is call centres dont give a fuck. Its an awful place to work the company knows it is so they do this to prevent people from taking stress days and such because not having every possible person on the phones hurts their business. Every call centre says that they are better than the rest but all of them eventually treat you like numbers and not like human beings.The best part here in the states is requiring a note when your company doesnt offer health insurance.

Basically a strongly emitting source of radiation is kept in a chamber with tubes leading through the chamber. Vials of samples get pushed into the chamber with an air shuttle kind of arrangement so they can get irradiated for analysis.

While the core of the reactor is housed in a heavy lead vessel, the rest of the reactor is made of cement with iron slugs used as aggregate instead of gravel. The iron chunks don't stop gamma emission as well as lead, but they do a better job than gravel.

One day, several trucks of cement were scheduled to begin casting of the walls of the core. The prof strenuously advised the construction foreman to only fill the trucks 1/3 full because the iron slugs would be considerably more dense than the aggregate they usually use. The foreman ignored the warnings, chalking them up as being the prattlings of an old naggy man and didn't give any orders to short fill the trucks. 

The trucks departed the cement plant charged with cement and iron aggregate and suffered eventual failure of all of their tires on the highway. They got stuck there loaded up with their massive overburdens of iron aggregate cement until their drum motors and bearings failed and the cement set inside the drums. They had to cut the drums apart off of the trucks  with plasma torches and jackhammers to clear up the heavy mess.Got any more details on location?

The swan is facing left, the mallard is facing towards the camera basically.I'm going to disagree with the majority here. It's a wonderful concept but the execution is a little unrefined. The type face of the logo and the restaurant are not the same so it feels disconnected. I think if the designer had instead focused on drawing the animals to create the ampersand, rather than squeezing them in to the sans serif ampersand, it would have better reflected the elegance of the type face in *The Swan & Mallard*.

Thank you all very much!""Paramount pictures""I few out of Seattle a few years ago and the pilot announced Rainier's visibility over the PA.  He proceeded to seriously bank the plane (felt like 30-35 degrees!) to give everyone a good view since we were flying more close to directly over the top.

That's the most I've ever felt a commercial flight banked to one side.  My face was smashed against the window and people were holding on to the armrests to not smash the people next to them.

I thought it was beautiful that someone that flies 100+ hours a month and has probably seen 100% of the country from 30,000+ feet countless times still acknowledges the beauty and shared it with everyone.  I wish I had been able to thank him after the flight.Awesome!  Right place, right time!  How did you keep the picture so crisp through glass?

However, to keep people from jumping ship, they gave you an upgrade card that let you upgrade to first class without trading in any miles or paying any fee if you flew 30,000 miles per year, which I did each year.  I stuck with them to the bitter end  because it meant I flew everywhere first class for the price of a coach ticket.

One night, I was flying JFK to SFO, cross country, and the stewardess came to me with 4 movies and asked me which one I wanted to see.  I told her I was just going to sleep during the flight and to ask another passenger.

You guessed it: no other passengers.  747 plane with a full crew.  It was a sad day.  I asked her why they didn't just cancel the flight and she said they needed the plane in SF the next day.

This modified version is designed and made by Hal Taylor (@HalTaylor_Rocks on IG).  
If you visit Hal's web page, this chair actually holds a very special and highly hypocritical back story.  You see, one of Hal's former apprentices once asked if he could use this design to make for himself, to which Hal said ""fuck no"".  The apprentice made one anyway and Hal was all ""argggghhhhh"".  Then Hal went on making reproduction Sam Maloof chairs for a living, just as he had before.
Edit:  Hal's web address.  http://www.haltaylor.com The store I'm referring to is at the bottom of the home page.  I'm not really trying to shit talk him, as Hal Taylor is easily one of the best chair makers in the country of this fashion (Maloof reproductions).

[Eastern Airlines Flight 980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980)Dan Futrell and I (Isaac Stoner) got lost down a rabbit hole on on Wikipedia looking up unrecovered black boxes. Took some serious effort but now there's a smashed up flight recorder on my kitchen counter!  That's the orange box. They need to keep looking.Actually, they found pieces of the casing of the flight recorders, and some loose magnetic tape which, [as they themselves say on their blog](https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61), may be nothing more than tape from a passenger's home video.

It's far too early to say they've found anything substantive, regardless of how amazing it is that they've managed to find anything at all.I just got to the part of the blog where they talk about finding crocodile skins all over the debris field, and basically accusing Eastern Airlines of taking part in a crocodile skin smuggling ring. Interesting...maybe they'll end up uncovering more than they bargained for, which is like the beginning of every horror/thriller movie.Why didn't any of the various airplane crash investigative agencies do this?

edit: answered my own question, sort of:  The NTSB did send people but ""because the wreckage was spread over a vast area and covered by 6 to 9 meters of snow, it was not possible for him and his fellow team members to locate either of the ""black boxes.""""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980#On-site_investigationI set small goals like not losing a sock in the laundry and I can't even accomplish that.I had read their blog as they were doing this. The part where they were finding the human remains and burying them... super powerful stuff man. I teared up a little reading that. Congrats on finding the recorder!That's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Or a small box in the Andes...Holy shit this is awesome. It makes me want to find another plane crash that has missing black boxes and go find one myself... Talk about bucket list shit.I bet it was the last place they looked.This will be an over dramatized movie, I guarantee it. ""dood we fahkin found the blahk bawx bro""Notice the subtle middle finger in the picture.I feel like they could have found this faster by crashing another plane into the mountain and watching where everything fell.Send these dudes after 370. Was anyone else thinking of the flight that crashed into the Andes mountains in 1972 and everyone had to resort to cannibalism?

>It started while Kaszlikowski was shooting the upcoming documentary K2 Touching the Sky. He wanted a personal project to occupy his downtime during the weeks-long filming schedule, so he sent his DJI Phantom on a recon mission to scout shooting locations. The drone scoped out places around Concordia, the area below K2 where the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers converge. Kaszlikowski spotted a section of glacier that was melting away, creating a dramatic clone-like structure and a picturesque miniature river.

>“The place was special, making a very clean graphic frame,” he says. “It was disappearing, melting, changing its form every day. It was quite obvious nobody will photograph it again like me; nobody will see it the same way the next season.”

Here's a summary on the shot and the [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/david-kaszlikowski-k2-glacier/)Higher resolution mirror wallpaper [Link](https://i2.wp.com/www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/033.jpg) (2200 x 1352)Looks like where you'd find an Ice-Type Legendary.This clears up some issues of what why it looks like that: 

*The Polish photographer and a guide trekked to the spot at night to create a strange but vivid image that looks like it might be an alien planet. He used a 30-second exposure shot with a Canon 5D Mark III on a tripod. While the shutter was open, he “painted” the water and surrounding area with an LED, creating an eerie glow on the ice and sky. Although he was there during the summer, the temperature still drops to a frosty 5 degrees Fahrenheit up there at 16,000 feet, so his hands were plenty cold while working.*

*The final image plays tricks with size and scale, and the foreground doesn’t provide many clues. Although the bend in the river is 65 feet wide, the mountains in the background are some of the highest in the world. The region includes K2, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum I and II—all of them topping 26,000 feet.*Needs a Yeti.I'm going to need a gold Chocobo.Looks like the pool with the moon spirits in the northern water tribe in avatarThe boundaries between reality and sci-fi are now blurred more than everI'd love to check out what kind of rocks are in there. i thought it was a 3d model at firstAnd then [these motherfuckers](https://i.imgur.com/kogRcW0.jpg) trod everywhere through it.This was not* a ""drone"", it was an rc helicopter (or [radio controlled multirotor helicopter](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom) ).

* wheelchair rugby
* 100m running, for amputees
* swimming

Now the other fucking post i was reading with the 2 army tanks makes a HELL of a lot more sense now.
I've been thinking about it for the past 20 minutes and couldn't understand why i was so fucking confused =sIf the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay was what it historically was, it would filter the entire bay's volume of water in 3 days. The oyster population is so low now that it takes over a year. Can the oysters also predict the World Series winner?Oysters are great. I organize an effort in my town to create oyster mats. These mats are chained together in specific areas of the river and foster new oyster beds by giving the larvae a place to attach to. If we get enough growth, it may have a positive effect on our river's water quality. Each oyster can filter 50 gallons a day of water and they are a keystone species of many ecosystems.This isn't as clear-cut of a comparison as the image wants you to believe. The water being clear isn't an indication of ecological health any more than being murky is. Murky could be pollutants, but it could also be algae. Algae are necessary to the ecosystem. The water on the right appears stripped of algae because the oysters eat it. That's good up to a point, and then it starts being a problem.

If I showed you this exact same image using lake water and zebar mussels, it would be a demonstration of the ecological damage done by invasive zebra mussels.That's where the flavour comes from.Question: Can I get oysters and put them in a fish tank with my fish and never have to clean the water again? Or at least not clean it so often?I can't look at this without being horribly reminded about getting norovirus from oysters a couple of years ago, and this pic kinda makes it a bit clearer just how easy it is for them to pick up bacteria from the water.

I explained to him about the dangers of frostbite and the importance of thick socks, boots, gloves, hats,  and having a real coat.

I even drove him to Goodwill where he found the right clothes for a tough Ohio winter. For the next few months, he would smile and thank me for teaching him about how to stay warm with the right clothes. 

Edit: grammarI went to college with this girl who was Swedish, but grew up in Miami. Swedish family, spoke Swedish at home, etc. But in South Florida. She made regular trips to Sweden every summer to visit family there.

But never in the winter. One year she flies to Sweden in December and it's snowing. She reacts to snow the way most people in south Florida do--joy, utter amazement, running around trying to catch flakes on your tongue, etc.

So there's this scene of this full-blooded Swedish girl, speaking Swedish, in Sweden, seeing snow for the first time at 16 years of age.

One day he asked me about the leaves changing colors and I explained how they would do that and then they would all fall off. He then asked a very anxious follow-up question:

""Will they come back?"" :-)

I reassured him they would. It began to snow on the first day of a freshman undergrad class I was in. A classmate from India with a thick accent shyly admitted he had never seen snow, so our professor encouraged our small class to run outside so Mohit could experience snowfall. I'll never forget his big smile, total sense of wonder, and his first comment when we got outside: ""Oh my goodness! It is like God has really bad dandruff!"" You haven't seen snow until you've seen it in giant piles in shopping mall parking lots; the snow dyed grey by the car exhaust. It is like a two wheeled Cool Runnings.

He hadn't even learned about snow in Haiti nor did he attend school. He didn't really understand how it worked, so he starts putting some in a bag. I asked him what he was doing and he says, ""I've got to bring some home to my daughter.

There's more to Rwanda than genocide.My boss is from india and this is his first time seeing snow. the day after about 5 inches of snow, when there were just flurries he was worried about driving home. After assuring him it wouldnt affect his drive home, he asked me what happened when it melted.i was confused. 

i said ""what?  what do you mean?""

""when it all melts what happen?  do they have to close the roads cuz they are all flooded?""  

It blew my mind that he didnt know what happened when snow melted.  I just figured everyone knew that it all just goes away.

We call it sand.Seeing the joy on their faces makes me feel a little bit better about the snow outside my building. It's only fuckin' SNOW, Allen!
That's how i would react if I ever see snow. (I'm from California)My aunt is married to a man who had children with two other women before he met her. His first wife lived near them in New Jersey, but the second was in Arizona. When their son was a teen, he moved from Arizona to NJ to spend some time with his dad and get the benefit of the better school system. They had his mom up for holidays, and while she was visiting for christmas it snowed heavily... and she'd never seen snow before, she'd lived her whole life in Arizona. My aunt bundled her up in some winter wear and took her for a walk.

She knew it fell from the sky. She knew it was cold. She'd had a sno-cone before, so she kinda understood the texture. What she hadn't imagined was how *quiet* the world becomes when it snows, how the snow absorbs all sound and there's a beautiful silence. 

Having lived in the northeast all my life I'm sick of snow in most ways, but I still enjoy that silence in the middle of a snowstorm.Moved to Philadephia. That was the first time I ever saw snow. When the ""flurries"" started I thought it was volcanic ash, panicked, and ran inside a bank. Then I saw no one else was running. Then I thought someone was shredding plastic bags and thought it was highly rude, and harmful to the environment. Then I took a bus back home. When I realized that this plastic bag shredding extended all the way to my house, I started doubting myself. It took me 4 hours to finally discover snow.....","[0.565, 0.06238, 0.480836, 0.066476, 0.055643, 0.255, 0.0, 0.061, 0.086, 0.18, 0.747, 0.9, 0.842]"

This should happen everywhere. 

Edit: Yes I know iceland isn't a very highly populated country. Which makes it's an easier thing to do.

Edit 2: Not saying that no other country has their stuff together and so on. Just praising iceland.For historical context, I recommend the Icelandic novel The Atom Station. It gives some background to the cultural attitudes of the polity of Iceland. I don't know about Iceland but we don't read it in schools in the US generally.

I bet the photographer got a ton of points from Professor Oak for that pic.My mom is obsessed with this animal. It's her profile picture on every social media platform. She makes me call her Pika sometimes and calls me Pika as well. It's confusing.

Edit: [yup](http://i.imgur.com/Hqi7vcb.jpg)I just read about this thing. It's more endangered than the panda. The Chinese call it a Magic Rabbit.>Native to the Xinjiang region of China, there are only 1,000 of these tiny, cute creatures, known as the Ili pika, left.

>Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat further up the mountain peaks.The name of it comes from the name of area where it's found, Ili Prefecture (which is actually a shortened version). 

There's so little information because of how elusive it is so we can't currently determine causes of its endangerment.

This display at Carnuntum is the only one of its kind on this site. It is even meant as a temporary display since sooner or later the Heidentor (heathen's gate) is supposed to be rebuilt following original Roman building style.

They have a very nice museum at the excavation site nearby where they already have a few fully functional Roman buildings that were rebuilt in the original style and with original materials.

Carnuntum is a fascinating excavation site with a very cleverly built museum which constantly improves.

During summer they have some festivities there and at their sister site ""Bad Deutsch Altenburg"". They show Gladiator fights, Roman army training, Roman lifestyle in general.

The site is about half an hour drive from Vienna and definitely worth a visit. Entry fees are moderate and the ticket is valid for the three main sites: Museum Carnuntum, Museum Bad Deutsch Altenburg, and the ""Amphitheater"" Bad Deutsch Altenburg.What if ruins have always been in the state they are now?

Cal. Dept. of Water Resources is letting out so much water from the lake in order to keep salinity levels of the delta in check. When they dropped the flow down too far, salt water from the San Francisco Bay started to creep in. There are multiple reasons for this, one being environmental (the Delta Smelt...) and irrigation purposes. Although it's part of it, California, or rather, Folsom and Sacramento, are NOT drinking this lake dry.

Guess I won't be going back to Sacramento anytime soonThe kids can still play on the beach, just without the splashing around in water part...Looks like New VegasI'd be metal detecting the hell out of that place""No lifeguard on duty...*forever*""It's worth pointing out that people only used to swim there because some people dug a reservoir and dammed a river. It's not a natural lake. California has been living on borrowed water for a long time. No one should be surprised when the bill comes due.Drought is part of the natural water cycle in California. Yes, people expanded to where they shouldn't have, without better backup systems in place. Yes, we are have a particularly bad drought right now.

I don't exactly know how this cultural attitude changed, but people scoff at big projects these days. Covering the CA aquaduct with solar panels, for instance. Or William Shatner's proposed super-long pipeline. Folks should also look up NAWAPA, a plan in the 50's to do man-made water distribution throughout the western US. Hell, even William Shatner proposed a super-long pipeline of a similar nature.

Astonishingly, the notion of long pipelines immediately invokes visions of science fiction in people's minds. Then when you point out that the petrochem industry makes *colossal* pipelines all the time, that is somehow considered irrelevant.

I will immediately betray what I said above, though: this isn't a usual cycle, and we are seeing something change. The Salton Sea was left to die, and it is have a ripple effect in the ecosystem all along the coast. The desertification of the LA region was essentially halted with the creation of the Salton Sea 100 years ago. The existence of the sea sustained weather systems that made the LA region much more livable. Now that the sea is essentially gone, the greater LA area is undergoing a drastic desertification, with soaring temperatures and exposure.

The sea could be saved, too, but again, people scoff at it. A 90 mile seawater pipeline could be built from the Gulf of California to refill the Salton Sea. Cost estimates are somewhere in the $500m-1b range. Scoffing ensues, but you can look at school districts that issues bonds in the hundreds-of-millions range that are just absorbed into people's pockets. If you listen to Eisenhower and compare to military spending, $1b is a small investment compare to military build-up.

... and seawater is actually less salty than the Sea is now! The Sea is 200 feet below sea level, and the pipeline could be passive, if designed correctly. There is a huge dry lake bed in Mexico that could be refilled to an artificial sea, too, if the pipeline was properly built. A little tricky, since it is 80 feet above seal level, but by coupling it to to the -200ft Salton Sea siphon could also make this a passive benefit.

Even if pumping was added, solar or thermal collectors could be added along the length of the pipe, thus making it zero net energy. The economic benefit alone to both countries would likely offset the cost within a decade. The biggest problem would be dealing with Mexico, now that they are a essentially a failed nation.Kids these days have no imagination.

It was basically an arctic rainforest because everything was so wet and overgrown with vegetation. There was fresh water everywhere, I did not have to worry about my water supply.

I was in high school, and the rest of my family was away at some farming convention for the weekend. I was out on the back porch and placed a tab under my tongue. Based on everything I had read and heard, I had done some meditation and relaxation exercises to try and reach as calm and steady a state as possible. I kind of wanted a spiritual sort of experience.

About 45 minutes after I took it, I really started to focus on my breathing. I could feel my skin merging with the air, and everything felt very solid, and whole. Until, that is, I opened my eyes. At that point, the clouds seemed to part, and the sky split open. The sun became a giant pixelated Mario head, and tried to eat me. I ran back inside, but was lucid enough to realize I wasn't okay. I didn't want to risk making a mess of my parents house, so I went back outside and ran straight for the neighbor's house.

They were growing a bunch of egg plants out back. For some reason, I thought the egg plants looked kind of like old-timey bombs, and I felt like I had to disarm them. Of course, this meant picking them all. Their fuses were still burning though, so I did the only thing I could think of: I pissed all over them. It put out the fuses, but the neighbor's wife came running out and beat the shit out of me with a dirty pair of trousers.So, I actually *was* under this bridge a while ago, and for people wondering, it still looks fantastic. People have respected the murals around the city that this artist has done and it really brightens up my day whenever I see one.

Man, I know too much about Beanie babies, and it sticks in my head like a steal trap. A few years ago, a girl said to me, ""my birthday is on November 6, and I said to her, you share a birthday with Pouch the Kangaroo."" So, for anyone who doubts what I'm about to say, I think I have the ruinous resume for this.

This collection of Beanies is hilariously terrible. Almost none of these were ever of any value. I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, so it's clear that these two were collecting to strike it rich. They weren't collecting just to have them. I see a lot of Legs the frogs. They had a little bit of value at one point, and when Chocolate the moose retired (which you can see a couple of, it jumped in value a little as well. But they were not big money makers. It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow. Rainbow and Iggy were released with their tags switched and body parts all messed about. There were a couple releases of each before Ty got it right. That said, it's pretty clear that she knows what she's doing, and he might be a moron. In her pile in th elower left hand corner, she has a Flip the cat, and (I think though it's hard to say for sure) a Dotty the Dalmation. Those two were pretty valuable after they were retired. Probably the most valuable in this collection presuming that the Lucky the Ladybug sitting in the middle of the pile is a later generation version of the Beanie. Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time. If it's a Doodle, I'm guessing at the time, I'd grab that. If it's a Strut, I'd go for the Crunch the Shark. In the end, Crunch would have been better, but Doodle was what everyone was speculating on.Not even Beanie Baby collectors can stand to be around Beanie Baby collectors.Apparently putting your hand to your face and sticking your finger on your mouth was quite the fad in 1999.I don't even care.  I'll say it.  As a kid who loved stuffed animals, these things were the shit.  There was one for just about any animal you could want.  Played with these things every day till I grew out of them.

So I am currently a student at said school and I'm not gonna say which one cause well I'm not a noodle head (hah good one) but as far as I know the story goes that this kid is one of the athletic coaches sons (not sure which sport, there are lots at my school) and one day during his dad's practice he decided to get instant noodles from our concessions stand that's open every day after school, kid gets the noodles puts some water in the cup and thinks ""30 secs for this bitch would be dope as fuck."" Kid pops open the microwave puts 30 seconds on the microwave and goes back to watching his dad coach. The only problem was that he put them on for 30 mins instead of seconds, forgets about them and comes back 28 mins and 50 secs later to find that his noodles became disappointmentles. He became somewhat of a living legend at our school and everyone loves and adores him.

Airlines and the military have strict policies regarding weather conditions at takeoff and arrival, and weather enroute. Flying through thunderstorms deliberately is a pretty big no no in most cases, and when squall lines can be hundreds of miles long, it can cause a lot of problems.

Remember that the next time someone complains about weather delays or cancellations.. ask if they actually want to fly in weather the pilots don't even want to.am i the only one who for a second thought this would be a Delta flight pic from 1889Hi All. I was on this flight. I assure you, it was not a fun ride. 
http://m.imgur.com/OLjcpcUAt least the front didn't fall off, then we would have to tow it out of the atmosphere In the meantime some poor maintainer took a look at the aircraft and is slightly pissed. Came here to see a busted up plane. Ended up learning so much about aircraft I could probably get a job in aircraft repair. That's gotta be terrifying. I wonder how calm the pilots had to be to keep the passengers calm.

Get outta here Buzzfeed.This may be a stupid question but, can't they see oncoming thunderstorms/hailstorms on their weather radar and take evasive action, change course etc? I can't believe that a hailstorm like this just pops out of nowhere.You can see in this graphic that pilots tried to fly between towo super cells and one of them closed in quicker than they thought

as I sit on a delta plane over the ocean, fuck this shit.[deleted]I posted this 24 hours before and no one noticed it :(
What am I doing wrongHail can actually be encountered flying between 2 storms.  As it is can be violently thrown out of the clouds.  Now, couple that with the aircraft flying at say 400 knots and you can see the reason how and why this fucked up the plane so bad.  It's also highly advised to keep a safe distance between storm so this doesn't happen.

Source:  I am a pilotThus actually makes me feel better about air travel.As I sit on a Delta flight, getting ready to taxi, I find this less than comfortingAs an engineer myself, if I were on that flight I would write a well-thought-out thank-you letter openly addressed to all of the staff at ~~Boeing~~ Airbus for taking the time to design, test, and build aircraft to take this type of abuse and still get me down on the ground in one piece.

Then I'd write another letter to Delta, thanking them for hiring the calibre of pilots that will land a plane in this condition and get me down on the ground in one piece.

A regular guy who selflessly brought joy to sick children.

RIP man.  I'm really sorry to hear of his passing.

I think it would be nice if the makers of the Batman games and movies gave him a nod.

He was a real hero.Waking up to learn there's one less hero in the world made me suddenly feel very tired again. Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.So he pulled onto the left shoulder, but his car was still partially in the lane and somebody hit him. I wonder if his hazards were on, because that car is jet black and would be really hard to spot at night.I met this guy last year almost to the day. My daughter has a leg length discrepancy and we were at a specialist hospital in Baltimore and he was there giving all the kids lanyards and huge coloring books. We were really looking forward to seeing him again next month when we went back. R.I.P.According to the stories I've read, Mr. Robinson would stop by the nurse's station before he left to find out if there were any children too sick to come out to see him, so that he could make sure to go in to see them specifically.

That's the key to his character.  This wasn't about attention or fame or publicity or promoting some cause of business.  We wouldn't know who this guy was if he hadn't gotten a speeding ticket and accidentally gone viral.  He kept right on doing the same thing after he got famous as he did before he got famous.  And the most important thing to him was that sick kid who wasn't able to come out to see him.

Bruce Wayne is a fiction; an entertaining fiction, but a fiction.  Lenny Robinson was a real man who is a role model for thoughtfulness, selflessness, and making a difference in a small way.

Batman was real, and his name was Lenny Robinson.Here is a video of Lenny visiting sick kids in the hospital.  He truly was a hero deserving of the name, Batman.  The world is a darker place without him.   RIP Batman.

https://youtu.be/fDDBJajLZwwLenny was in a documentary called Legends of the Knight that is on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/80014903) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/795787), if anyone wants to check out his story and see him in action. It's about people who use Batman as an inspiration for themselves or others.

Seeing the kids respond to him is incredible. The world lost a great man.Batman taken out by a Toyota Camry.  This world is fucked up.Too bad it wasn't [this guy instead](http://i.imgur.com/IMc8Kiv.jpg)A tad late to things, but Lenny was actually very close to one of my best friends and his family. A group of my friends (whom all play SSBM together, shouts out to /r/smashbros and the Melee Community) all learned of Lenny's passing this morning straight from our buddy. Although the loss was hard for him and his family, I feel its important to highlight the good that Lenny put into this world. Admittedly, I did not know Lenny nearly as closely as my friend or his family, but I do recall a very specific memory I had with Lenny a couple years ago. At my friend's Bar Mitzvah Lenny was there decked out in full batman attire. He was a class act by all definitions, and went out of his way to make sure every kid, myself included had a memorable experience. An entertaining, genuine, loving individual, Lenny aka Uncle Batman will be missed. RIP Uncle Batman. He was a hero this world needed.

Proof: My friend, the dopest Marth/Fox main in the world with his partner in justice Uncle Batman. Although they weren't technically related, Lenny was considered part of his family.

by a Toyota Camry,

...so help me jesusIf there is an afterlife, he's going to the good side of town. He clearly lived a cool life if he had the money to buy a lambo and a batsuit. He then had the heart to use that for a greater good and in the process gave us all some laughs. RIP Lenny.Such a shame, my son was in a children's hospital and this gentleman was there with his 60's Batmobile that he had recently purchased and was driving back east with.  Got some pics of the [Batmobile](http://i.imgur.com/nKnRe63.jpg?1) and my son still has his [autograph](http://i.imgur.com/XlrPgMI.jpg) hanging up in his room.  
He not only put some smiles on the kids faces but also everyone at the hospital that went out to check out the car.  He was the Hero we needed that day.*batman voice* just here in my garage, with my new Lamborghini that I bought. Fun to drive around Gotham. You know what I like better than Lamborghini's...JUSTICEThats terrible. He's more of a hero than the guy he was dressed as and probably never realized it. RIP Lenny. You were a Batman among men.i live in maryland. i can not tell you how many times since i got my license over 20 years ago now,  the countless people that have been killed by their cars breaking down and them getting out and standing near their car on the side of the road, attempting to change a flat tire, or are under the hood checking the engine. 95 percent of the time these people are safely out of the driving lanes and yet people still manage to hit them. im telling you now for anyone who doesnt know about maryland: 

MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.

ive never seen worse drivers. and ive lived in huge cities. it is the worst here for accidents like this one. it is the reason why we have the highest insurance rates in the united states. if you have the unfortunate problem of living here or for some ungodly reason decide to visit here as a tourist im going to give you a little advice: 

- IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDIAN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE WALL, AND IF THERE IS GRASS BY THE MEDIAN PULL ALL THE WAY OVER INTO THE GRASS!

- NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR CAR ON A MARYLAND HIGHWAY TO CHANGE A TIRE OR LOOK AT YOUR ENGINE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  IF YOU HAVE A FLAT DRIVE IT ON THE SIDE MEDIAN UNTIL YOU CAN FIND AN EXIT. EVEN IF IT MEANS DAMAGING YOUR RIM. YOUR RIM IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE. 

- IF IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR CANNOT BE FIXED DO NOT SIT IN YOUR CAR WAITING UNTIL HELPS ARRIVES!! EVEN IF YOU ARE SAFELY OFF TO THE SIDE. PEOPLE HERE WILL STILL HIT YOU! GET OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE AND STAND AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENCING, BUT YOU'LL BE ALIVE. PEOPLE DIE IN THEIR CARS HERE ALL THE TIME SITTING IN THEM WAITING FOR HELP OR A TOW TRUCK. 

again i reiterate, MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.  take every precaution you can if your car breaks down on a highway here. And a positive light in the world goes out. sad day. Met this guy in person when a psychology practice with which I'm affiliated co-produced a batman documentary. He was a hero who happened to dress up like another hero.

Legit cried when I learned of his passing.*We die every day. A thousand times an hour. Anyone who does this work sees it. Death. Their own... their partner's... their loved ones. We go to work anyway. Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind. Death is powerless against you if you do your job.*
- Batman, JLA Vol 1 72Karma did the opposite here. What a shame. The person who caused his death needs to do the right thing and take over for Lenny Robinson as Batman.>Elizabeth later told him that she was being bullied by other kids at her elementary school. “They don’t believe that Batman is my friend,” she told him.  So, Robinson went to school with her, appearing in full costume before the student body. He told them bullying was wrong and called her onstage to give her a Batman necklace.  Elizabeth, he announced, is my friend.

>There is a legend in Ankh-Morpork of an ancient drum in the palace that will bang itself if ever an enemy fleet is seen sailing up the Ankh, although the legend has died out in recent centuries, partly because it's the Age of Reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the Ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front.There's something alive in there!

Edit: I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but that flashy building behind is one of the many overpriced white elephants our corrupt government has built with money that should be put to better use, built especially for the Olympics.

Edit: NVM, it was *Twilight.*I used to work at bookstore. My proudest moment was when someone came in looking for a book... they couldn't remember anything except that it was pink. I found it.I worked as a librarian for a few years, and we got this kind of question quite often. 

""I forget the name, but it's yellow.""

""Okay, let's go to the yellow book section then, shall we?""

They never seemed to appreciate that response. It was as if they felt I was mocking them or something. one of the thrift shops in my town sorts all their books by colourTotally reminds me of a comic book I've had for years.

http://i.imgur.com/k4ldvcU.jpgFormer bookstore employee, can confirm. Not sure what it's like now, but back then (20+ years ago... jeez I'm old) 90% of the time it was the book Oprah had talked about that day/week/month (I don't recall if she had her ""book club"" at the time or not, because I was a teenage male who did not own a television so 3 strikes against giving a shit about her show). 

If I recall correctly the ""green cover book"" was the Celestine Prophecy, the ""outside party after dark"" book was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Why do I recall these things... because I was asked the same question (more or less) a hundred times. 

This was before everyone had a cell phone, much less a smartphone, so there wasn't an easy way to ""look it up"" (this was when you still had to buy Netscape). I recall a particularly terrible manager of mine responding to my suggestion that we ""make an Oprah's books"" table to help people that I should instead ""expand my knowledge beyond the classics and computer books by watching Oprah regularly.""

We would be ecstatic if you could add a caption or comment to this post mentioning our name and our website bluewillowbookshop.com!!The Fault in Our Stars isn't  in there.One time I was at a fairly large Indigo book store looking for a book I'd seen before online.  Of course I couldn't remember the name of it or the author, so I was just skimming through the section I thought it would be in.  A lady that worked there asked me if I needed help, and I was almost going to just tell her I was fine because I thought there's no way she can help me find this book.  But, i thought what the hell, let's give it a shot.  So i told what I remembered about the book, which was basically that it was 'kinda sciency' and 'had a red triangle on the front'.  She took a second to think about it, then ""Oh yeah, it's over here""  and then she took me a couple rows over, reaches down to the bottom shelf and pulls out the book I was looking for.

Did she just know where every book was?

Was she magic?Twist, all those covers are just dust jackets for other booksOh hell no. This actually happened. Couldn't tell me the name, what it was about our who wrote it but they had seen their friend's copy and it was (kid you not) blue. 

45 minutes of talking about the types of books the friend liked and narrowing it down slowly I found the fucking book. 

They looked at it, said ""oh, yeah. That's what it was called. Thanks"" and walked out of the store without buying a damn thing. 

Fuck that person. If it's have had a weapon, I'd have gone to jail. As a former B&N employee I can concur. This happened way too often, or they would have oddly specific irrelevant information. ""I'm looking for a book. It's got a tree on the cover and is 357 pages long."" 

My other favorite thing was when they would just say ""I'm looking for a book."" I would then grab the nearest book to me, hand it to them, and walk off.

What they are doing is forming what we call a ""rub nest"". A rub nest is when 2 or more LBs come together and ""lick"" each others faces (fun fact LBs have tongues almost 1/3 the length of their bodies!) and mouths to share nutrients and more importantly, build each other's immune systems by sharing antibodies with one another. They will stay like this for hours at a time, licking each others faces until their immunity are bolstered and they can no longer become sick and die.

It also reminds me of this: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2c/cc/a0/2ccca0f375f9ca32816fce049f73f0f4.jpg""Sand Sculpture""..

I think I'd try killing myself after the first decade.Wow. this doesnt make it better but atleast its not
Oklahoma and he's still alive How people can go through something like that without coming out the other end nearly insane and full of hatred and blood-lust for the pieces of shit that put them there, I don't understand. How can you have 27 years of your life taken from you, not to mention spending those 27 years years in a cage with human scum, and not want vengeance? Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from ToledoThe look on his face says it all. Obviously it's great that he was finally exonerated, but this picture makes me sad. You know in those 27 years he has missed so much of his life. No amount of money could fix it, but he deserves billions. I'm 25, he's been in prison longer than I've been alive. No idea if he has kids, but he definitely has(had?) parents. Imagine losing your family for 27 years. Not to mention everyone you know thinking you're a murderer. So so sad.You would be surprised how many innocent are locked up.The face of a man who has been tried.The look on his face says it all. That's 27 years of pain and anguish for a mistake that wasn't his.That man's face. Holy shitI'll point out the case of Ronald Cotton since it hasn't been mentioned yet. He only received $111,000 from the state of South Carolina after being wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade. His case also showed us a few things about handling witness testimony in law enforcement. Firstly, the victim of the crime had said she dedicated all of her effort during her rape to memorizing her attackers face; she identified cotton with certainty as her attacker, and he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Second, the investigators of her case made affirming statements to her following her indication of cotton as her rapist, causing her to believe her choice was the correct one. There were also inconsistencies in the investigation such as the line-up procedure that was used and an improper alibi given by cotton during his first interrogation being the only other piece of evidence used against him. CBS made a documentary about this story called [picking cotton](http://youtu.be/-2oDRfj0vME)source:

Poor guy. I believe he will be compensated handsomely for wrongful imprisonment though. Won't get him back all those wasted years or ease the pain of missing out on a lot of his life, but at least it should help him restart his life or depending on his age have a nice retirement. Ohio: 
$40,330 per year (or amount determined by state auditor) in addition to lost wages, costs, and attorney's fees. So a minimum of $1,088,910.Wouldn't be surprised if this was another case of false accusation from ""eye witnesses""Has anyone noticed the look on this mans face, or was everyone sidetracked by money talks?  The emotions being expressed here are so complex that just this millisecond snapshot of what he was feeling sent shivers through me.  I'm glad this man was released.  I can't even begin to imagine what sort of indignities this man suffered through for 27 years, but I'm sure no amount of money will ever compensate for it.  wow. Im 28, he spent pretty much all of my life in jail. Ive experienced to much wonder and wildness....all while he was locked up. My heart hurts for these peopleI went to a play called ""The Exonerated"" once about people who were locked up for crimes they didn't commit. People would be shocked and disgusted how often this happens. 

I can't even imagine how this guy feels. Imagine, when he went in it was the '80s. So much has changed and he's just been sitting in a cell. The people who go back and work on getting these people exonerated are really heroes. This is why we shouldn't have a death penalty. Think of all the guys that were extinguished instead of exonerated.That is truly upsetting. Can you even imagine? You did not do this thing, this terrible thing - murder - that they say you did. And then you go to jail for life. The thought that you are going to rot in jail forever for something you did not do. How quickly would you lose all hope? And then 27 years later, maybe after you've relinquished any and all thoughts of a life outside of prison, you come to find that you will be freed. 

All of the emotions he is experiencing, I cannot even fathom. I just want to give him a hug. 

This makes me want to be a lawyer and fight for people who are wrongfully imprisoned. No money can recover what that man lost. 27 years is about how long I've been alive. Think of all that time. He lost his chance at a career. At seeing the rise of the internet and tech. He lost his youth. He lost his reputation, his freedom. He probably lost himself. You don't spend nearly 3 decades in prison and not come out a different man. The system didn't take away 27 years of his life. The system took his soul. The system took everything that he ever was and ever could have been.

What's a million dollars to all of that?As a corrections officer, this is why I treat every person under my care as though they are innocent. Because some of them *are*.Sweater vest.

Growing up near these birds I never thought twice about it.

However, I was surprised to find how many people didn't realize that these birds can fly.

[Here is a video of a peacock in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Gr_0cHlpM)

I've never seen them fly long distances however I have seen them fly to high trees (30+ feet tall).

I've never seen them directly fly to the top of a 30ft tree, usually they fly to the lower branches and I think they just work their way to the top.  

When I visited the Arcadia, CA arboretum, a worker said there is a peacock that can fly and perch itself up on one of its 60+ foot tall trees.

[Here's a very out of focus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaO1vhDyrk) but it does show some context of these birds flying out of pretty tall trees.Peacocks are not graceful, my school had them all over the place and it would really be stretching it to call what they do flying.

They flap their wings like a motherfucker, making all kinds of racket, just to get up onto the roof and then when they decide to come down it's like the god damned Hindenburg.  You hear this loud flapping followed by them crashing down and it's all Oh, the humanity.....""

It's the only reason that I choose that liquor store over others in my town.I'm not handy at all but this situation would have me in this hardware store buying stuff useless to me every time I was ""in the neighborhood.""I once went to a gas station in the middle of bumfuck nowhere that had a german shepherd.  No human, far as I could tell, just a german shepherd.

As soon as I walked in, that dog lept off the counter, growling, and ran over to bite me - I thought I was a goner, but it just stood there, holding my pant leg with his teeth.  Then it slowly pulled me towards the door, and I kinda said ""Okay"" and started walking to the door, dog leading me by the pant leg, when I got to the door, it started pushing me.  That's when the (human) owner came out from the bathroom in the back and said ""Oh I see you've met Sandy"".They would instantly become my exclusive hardware distributor. I wouldn't shop around for prices. Anything in my house breaks and I'd be on my way to the dog store. Labs are so kind and helpful and boisterous and they're just my favoriteThis is my favorite thing I've seen on the internet today.Ah , the store dog. Awesome ! Our neighborhood hardware store has a shop cat. All that lazy bastard does is lie on the counter in the sun. And occasionally try to trip customers while escaping out the door.

Still - the neighborhood hardware store is a wonderful place. Little old man or lady who knows where every thing is, even the gizmo they bought in 1947 and never sold. If you have one , cherish it, shop there. Because big box home stores have no souls and often no clue !I hope OP wanted a sprinkler hose, cuz they got one now.Good job pupper. 

Whoops, wrong sub. http://i.imgur.com/xxR7c6P.jpgThere's a gas station in a town I used to live in ran by some hilarious incredibly nice middle eastern dude. He trained his cat to reach out its paw and lower its head to show you respect for a tip, then when you give it a tip it puts it in its mouth (if it's cash) and brings it to him. Or pushes it off the counter into a little red cup if you use change. After that he gives it a treat. 

In Belgium, Wisconsin, the only hardware store in town is also the only liquor store in town.He looks like such a good boy :) I want to give him a treat.Now you can't shop anywhere else ever again. 
*Edit: Can I be someone other than GallowBoob?Do they sell anvils?I grew up in a small town. As a kid I needed a last minute physical so I could play sports in school. Our local doctor wasn't available so we went to an even smaller town nearby where I could see a doctor. The doctor's office had a giant lazy dog lying on the floor of the waiting room. He was breathing so you could tell he was alive but otherwise he gave no indication of life. The doctor was smoking a cigarette with the longest ash imaginable. He asked me, ""Are you healthy?"" I nodded. He said,""ok"" filled out the form and I left. That was the physical.I hope this is true, because that's fuckin' adorable.They used to have seven dogs and a wonderful selection of dark chocolate.Ask him a question please... I have to do some work on my ROOF!... Does he think I should ROOF! with shingles or go with roll ROOFing on my ROOF!??My name is?
Reminds me of a black lab I saw walking with its owner down the high street here in Canterbury. There was an empty plastic bottle on the sidewalk just in front of them. The dog looked up at their owner who then slightly gestured towards the bottle.  Without missing a step, the lab scooped up the bottle and kept on trotting along.  I like to think it carried that bottle all the way home and then dropped it in the recycling bin! Such well-meaning pups here!Sure it's all fun and games until someone wants 4 cans of paint.BlacklabsmatterI hope he makes at least 15 treats per hours, with bonus pets thrown in.","[0.730469, 0.059945, 0.036822, 0.05491, 0.039086, 0.083, 0.0, 0.671, 0.136, 0.171, 0.741, 0.833, 0.82]"

Really.  No sarcasm or underlying snark.The couple that trips together, stays together.That is crazy, huh? Congratulations to them!
This makes me so ridiculously happy!! My parents had this exact album when I was growing up and played it ALL the time. In fact, it was even the background soundtrack at my Dad's memorial service. I spoke of his die-hard hippie spirit and all he'd imbued upon us. God damn hippies ruining the nuclear family of America! Man they've probably been through some shit together, and by shit I mean wild hippy orgys and swinger romps.This is really nice. My parents and the 2 other couples that they went to Woodstock with are all still together. They are all still best friends as well. They have known each other since high school and still get together almost every other week. My mom speaks to the 2 other women on the phone probably every day. I have been on multiple family vacations with all of them from when I was very young through my late teens. I have been to all of their kids weddings and they were at mine. It's a nice story about a Bunch of kids from the Bronx that life turned out pretty nice for. The most beautiful thing is not only are they still together, they're still smiling.
Staying married to the same person for decades is harder than it looks.I didn't even know the Woz was married LSD in the 60s and a lifetime of proper fucking will plant a permanent grin on your face. Great to hear. Thanks for that. :)Credit to Burk Uzzle the photographer. He took a bunch of the iconic Woodstock photos. And if you're in Durham, NC he has a show up right now at the Nasher Museum (but no Woodstock photos there) http://nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions/uzzle/I'm so alone.

EDIT: To make this less of an awful comment, [here's a photo I took when I covered Eaux Claires last year](http://i.imgur.com/YDfpYAw.jpg). I love seeing moments like these...when two people are so intimate and comfortable with each other. I live vicariously through those glimpses of happiness.

EDIT EDIT: Here's [another one from the same festival](http://i.imgur.com/QeFQ612.jpg). I was shooting The National, and during their song 'I Need My Girl' this guy next to me turned around, got down on one knee, and proposed to his girlfriend. This is almost directly after (I let them have their moment obviously, she was sobbing!) and then I asked their permission to take it. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to ask their names, so I'm hoping someday someone recognizes them. I mean look at his face. That is happiness.She was my elementary school nurse and I went to school with both their sons. They are really great people.  They had a cockatoo that was a fucking dick that would attack people though. 

Edit: bad grammar

*This* is why you need to be careful when buying a car not to buy a ""salvage"" title. Cars like this are bought from the owners by the insurance companies, and then some are resold at auction by increasingly unscrupulous people as the car goes down the chain. Soon it appears at a fly-by-night car lot, looking all spiffy... but if you check the title history (via carfax or similar) you'll find the ""flood salvage"" on there. Stay far, far away from such cars. There is likely damage you can't see to electrical connections, etc., that will give you headaches for years to come.Houston, we've had a problem[This poor guy underestimated the flood waters in Houston](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtlsIwhZHLo)Cars for sale, New upholstery!I think the engine is flooded .  .  .Real question, can a car be salvaged after something like this or is it pretty much a total loss?That water is insurance company tears.Either that water came up really quick and that is why all the cars have their lights on, or my preferred theory is that the water shorted out the light switches on all of them and caused the lights to come on.Insurance companies are writhing and remodeling TOS to eliminate flood insurance The team experimented with using cars in lieu of horses for water polo with dire results.

Thank you everyone for the kind words.  
You guys are so nice.


Beautiful picture.  I love the depth of field present with the background.  You can tell that the lens quality was excellent back then.  You also did a terrific job with the colorization.Hah! Nice try. Using time travel is cheatingHow does colourising work? I'm confused as hell how you manage to get the colours.Colorization helps me pretend this wasn't 80 years ago and the kittens aren't dead... At first glance it looked like she was hanging kittens by their skin.  Best double take I've made today.Okay. Nobody asked, so I will. Any idea why she's putting them into socks and essentially hanging them out to dry?Middle cat- ""I'm so sick your shit Gretel""Holy shit. How long did this take. I enjoy recolorizing too. 

This is one of [Elvis](http://i.imgur.com/nAWijJo.jpg) I did. Middle kitten is so done with this shit.

(But really great colourization!)Kittens! In SOCKS!!Cats were a lot cooler about shit in 1931.Present day http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/b/b5/230px-Eleanor_Abernathy.png/revision/latest?cb=20140817113422Incredible job, OP! I love that the film aesthetic is still intact. How did you manage to get her skin such a good color? I always have a hard time compensating for the gray hue underneath and it never turns out this good. Could you give any pointers?This looks like it could have been taken yesterday. The windows look like uPVC and the house looks like your average British house.

Good job.[deleted]Surprised no one seems to have posted a link to /r/colorizedhistory yet. Lot's of great images like this.Quick question: Why does the lighting on the bush on the right look different from the original?

EDIT: [gif](http://i.imgur.com/jW8HsTC.gif).

Also, if it's possible, could you show us the image, with the black and white photo hidden?     
So we just see the colours you've added in?Nicely done! I also colorize photos, and you've clearly put serious time into this (atleast that's what I would take me to do something like this).

And [another fantastic landscape of Pluto](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/nh-apluto-wide-9-17-15-final_0.png).Massive mountain ranges composed entirely of ice.  That's incredible.User Ian R of unmannedspaceflight.com created this [colourised version](http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=37888), using existing MVIC colour data.For perspective, this image was taken 4.67 *billion* miles away.  It would take you almost 8,900 years to drive there at 60 mph.

And in terms of our galaxy, that is microscopically miniscule.  Our universe is REALLY big.How far we have come. From bashing each other on the head with a stick to gather food to exploration of our solar system. I sincerely hope we're entering a golden age of progress and understanding. It feels like Pluto is taking a bunch of extreme selfies of itself all made up and doing unexpected things in an attempt to make its ex ND Tyson super jealousGreat post of picture...and not to wax too scientific in /r/pics, but this isn't really a ""sunset"", because Pluto basically rolls along its orbit with the axis tilted on its side (120° specifically) with regard to the plane of its orbit.  This means the ""north"" end of Pluto is constantly rotisserieing in sunlight, and the ""south"" end away from the Sun is in constant darkness.

So think of these as the mountains lining the way into Modor, constantly in twilight.Interesting to note the lack of crater activity. what are those layers in the atmosphere, and what's causing these mountain ranges to crop up? why does pluto have mountains but, say, the moon doesn't?for scale:

http://imgur.com/20TwnclThose mountain ranges look massive Question for any science-savy person: 

What are the causes of such enormous mountains? Plate techtonics? Impacts? I would love to know how tall those mountains are.Absolutely amazing. Less money spent on war and more spent on giving NASA it's budget back.  Now we need a new edit for one of my favorite wallpapers https://i.imgur.com/p5fLTnB.jpgMeh.  You should see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion.  Now that's something.The title of this picture in /r/space is simply “Close-up of sunset on Pluto”.

It really shows how sensationalist /r/pics has become.If that doesn't convince the Flat-Plutoists nothing will.Do we have any idea how tall those mountains are? How do they take such wonderful pictures with so little light? How big are these mountains? Ballpark it or something i just need an answer.Earth is prettier...I officially call Dibs on Pluto. Sorry everyone, I'm pretty sure I'm first to call dibs....soo...Why does it appear to have atmosphere?It is amazing,

> Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a pair of residential towers in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy, between Via Gaetano de Castillia and Via Federico Confalonieri near Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station. They have a height of 110 metres (360 ft) and 76 metres (249 ft) and will host more than 900 trees (approximately 550 and 350 trees in the first and second towers respectively) on 8,900 square metres (96,000 sq ft) of terraces. Within the complex is also an 11-story office building; its facade does not host plants.

> The towers were designed by Boeri Studio (Stefano Boeri,Gianandrea Barreca and Giovanni La Varra). It also involved input from horticulturalists and botanists.Any civil engineers here have some insight to how this works in the long term?

As far as I know, roots don't give a fuck about concrete and will just grow straight through it. I'm assuming they do something to prevent this, maybe metal instead etc. That's gotta be a bitch to maintain honestly. hanging gardens have been built in a far away land! Dude, vertical forest.

COOL, BUT WHERE DO THE ROOTS GO?!with all evergreen plantings and decent amount of moisture in the air. this is a wonderful way to improve quality of life, create wildlife habitat and keep the building cool. im sure they have pre approved plants and something similar to a windowwashing team that comes and does maintenance.That looks like MinecraftHere is another similar [forest mid-rise in Torino, Italy](http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5502/126b/e58e/ce81/2900/01d3/large_jpg/%C2%A9bg_25Verde_017.jpg?1426199141).

I really like how unique the vertical view is in terms of re-framing our relationship to trees.  Seeing the forest 'deconstructed' in a way, one apartment = one tree, really drives home how connected we really are, when cities tend to obscure this aspect by removing trees, turning that relationship from direct to abstract by completely separating the cityspace from the naturespace.

Her older sister, another great-aunt, died of diphtheria at age six.

This is only a stone's throw away in history. VACCINATE.

P.S. If you want to learn more about what life was like for polio survivors, there's a wonderful memoir by Peg Kehret called Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio.

Actually modern ventilators and endotracheal intubation made this obsolete because we still need to ventilate people. Still get vaccinated though. Makes me think of radiohead. I work in public health and I still can't believe this is an issue. Parents come in explaining how they aren't gonna put that ""poison"" in their kids. That they're going to just boost the immune system through diet.

You may notice the town is walled - [in 1248 it withstood three years of siege.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monemvasia)This seems like something I'd be proud of finding in a video gameI may be too late to the party, but I'll post anyway.

I actually stayed there two years ago. There is a small hotel on the island (on the side closest to land, next to the bridge). 

Here are some pictures of the hotel : [Image 1](https://d1p98clqffzjxh.cloudfront.net/lazareto/L13405.jpg). [Image 2](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cc/0f/c7/tower-and-stone-cottage.jpg).

I ran up to the top of the island every day of our stay. There's a church up there, and a couple of lookouts, one of which can be seen in OP's picture (top of the island, closest to land).

What hasn't been mentioned here is that the island and town is pretty much uninhabited - a lot of the building have been restored for historical purposes.

Currently much of the town is closed off to the public - buildings and areas that are open have been converted to tourist shops, bars and hotels. It's a pretty cool place. Perhaps when the restorations are fully complete there will be room for more people to stay in the town.

Without a doubt, my favourite part of Monemvasia is the little enclosed ""pool"" on the side. I couldn't find any great pictures, but here is a [pretty decent one](http://www.mediterranean-cruise-advice.com/images/IMG_0082.jpg), showing the little enclosed natural pool, which curves around and continues beyond the picture. I really enjoyed staying there.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that [in this conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2tupdd/the_hidden_town_of_monemvasia_greece/co2i6zr?context=10000), /u/woohalladoobop points out that the building OP is talking about is a city-owned home for the mayor to live in, and claims that he lived there. I'm calling out his bullshit.

The full comment, as it has since been deleted:
> I actually come from Monemvasia. That house is owned by the city for the mayor to live in. Fun fact: Mayor Spiros Anagna was thrown out of a window over the cliff by some townsfolk in the 1920's after he was caught having an affair with an underage girl who worked at the house.

The house isn't a house, it's a church, named Agia Sofia (pronounced ayia sofia). [Here is a picture](https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/38470106.jpg) of some tourists next to it (not my picture).

EDIT: [Here are some photos that I took](http://imgur.com/a/Qj7xa#0). The last picture is me, and yes, my face is a black box. That is the highest point on the island. Wasn't wearing my running gear that day, since I walked up instead with the rest of the family.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold![This house on the right side of the ridge](http://i.imgur.com/RuC1quY.png) looks like a super-villain's hidden lair disguised as a mansionWell, not so hidden now...Man, these guys are never getting Google Fiber...Some great memories from this place! My favourite ones:

* The stairs that lead you underneath and outside the town walls, to a platform facing the open sea (The Myrtoon Pelagos (pronounced ""Mir-to-on""). People could dive in, the waters are amazing, and there are some steps to help you back up. In the summer, children would joyfully sit on the platform and let the waves wash over them. 
* The view from the center of the town square facing up towards the rock and the steps leading to the top is beautiful, brings to mind something out of a fairytale.
* There are some great coctail bars up there (it helps that I spent my summer there with great friends as well)!

**EDIT: cannot format....This town has an awesome history. For the Crusade buffs out there, when Constantinople was displaced from the Byzantine Empire after the 4th Crusade, many various Crusader kingdoms were carved out from Greece. Monemvasia held out though for the longest time as a pirate town/raiding point and proved to be a headache for the occupying Crusader kingdoms. Even when the entire Peloponnesus was under Crusader control, this one seaside enclave held out. Its amazing.**[Spanakopita!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wgR_4TwHOQ)**

Weird, I always think of it as being an 80's show. By far the greatest Electrical Engineer to graduate from Oxford. ([not joking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson#Early_life_and_education))Best episode, in my opinion.The first time I ever saw Mr. Bean was when a short episode played in a movie theater before Tim Allen's *The Santa Clause* in 1994. 

It was [the one where he meets the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JizFAhEpiEc), and at that point in all my 11 years, it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.[new whip](http://imgur.com/zfQ3xOx.jpg)I have always loved mr bean. Both my parents are deaf, and would always watch this show. Not only do I love it cos its a super funny show, and Rowan is amazing, but I always loved the fact my parents could watch it and understand everything!

Thinking about fact that I fell down due to uncontrollable laughing multiplied the laughing with a factor 10 and made me lose track of time and pain from the fall. My dad had to pick me up to make sure I could breath. I like to believe that this is what shaped me into being the guy I am today, always trying to make people laugh and have fun.

I like to take some more of that car polish and smear it all over they tits

These are, indeed, German turrets, called pillboxes, that were designed to overlook the small town of Saint Malo and defend it against a joint American/British attacks.

Now, if you don't know anything about St Malo, here is a picture to set the mood:

https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&rais=1&oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.letriskel.co.uk%2Fimages%2Frsz_st_malo_june_09_052.jpg&sp=d4f6453f5ef9ca2a9434f0309d0103d2

Now, St Malo is an old medieval city, surrounded by enormous walls. The Germans built a fortress in St Malo proper, along with a series of bunkers in a small hill overlooking the city, the only visible part of which are these gun turrets.

They also built another series of bunkers and AA guns on an island (called Cezembre), which is about 25 minutes away from St Malo, effectively turning the city and its bay into one enormous fortress.

In 1944, shortly after the Normandy Landing, the Allies were faced with a difficult task: either ignore St Malo and risk that the German fortress would attack their rear lines (as it is fairly close to Normandy) or try take the city and suffer heavy losses.

The solution taken was dramatic: the American and the British air forces fire-bombed the city and the Cezembre island for several days, essentially destroying pretty much every building within the city walls, and turning the island bunkers into a pile of rubble. I have seen old German AA guns on that island, and they were warped from the heat.

The final operation saw British ships shelling the German gun turrets from the sea. Pretty much each turret is pockmarket with these shells, and you can actually put your fist in some of these all the way inside the turret itself. The poor bastards inside did not stand a chance.

American ground troops then swept in and the Germans surrendered pretty much without a fight. My family is from there and my father and grand-father used to tell me stories about this battle.

You can look up Saint Malo on Wikipedia, and there are also tons of other sites that talk about the place, which is very beautiful and interesting. The real shame is that the original German bunkers are now closed.

EDIT: well, my first real comment on Reddit, and I got Gold! Thanks!!That particular gun emplacement overlooks the harbour entrance at St-MaloCrazy and saddening to look at that, and think ""Wow, look at those holes! That must have been intense!""

But then to realise I'm 30yrs old, and in all probability it was guys a full decade younger than me sitting in there utterly terrified wanting to go home.

That line between ""well that is certainly interesting"" and ""jesus fuck, this actually happened..."" is a complicated one.Bullet holes make it look like a slightly melted chocolate.Good grief what kind of gun made the holes?

Cause im thinking of this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtopxCjs518

Obviously its not the same quality steel but still.Is that a shell you can see stuck in one of the holes? About a third of the way from the top towards the left side.I went to Normandy 2 years ago while in France for work and two things really struck me:

One, you'd have to be insane to storm that beach. It's wide and deep and it was easy to see the massive advantage the gunners had over the invaders. I knew this based on everything that I have read or seen, but nothing prepares you for seeing it in real life.

Two, while you could still see and even walk into the pill boxes and other fortification that the Germans built, they were starting to be overcome by nature. That was amazing to me. In 50 years those scars will be gone.

*From my mother’s sleep I fell into the State,*

*Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,*

*I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.*

*When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.*This is crazy, I visited France a few years ago and spent a couple days in St. Malo. My friends and I camped on the hill across from the city that had a handful of these pillboxes.

All of them were absolutely covered in bullet holes, you could actually find plenty of bullets that had been fused into the metal 70 years ago.

> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).

> The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

It's not functional, piping goes straight up, meaning most of the heat goes up the chimeny. No baffling. Dangerously hot to the touch. No ceramic tiles below it means if you open the doors your house will burn down down. Couches are too close with a fabric throw that will go up in flames. Uneven bottom will mean it will be difficult to start a proper fire. Limited (no) intake control (EDIT: Draft, I had a brainfart on that). If it's a real surplus mine it will burn through pretty quickly, constant heat will ruin the integrity of the metal. A season of maple will destroy it. Good luck opening the hatch with metal handles. Also the fire looks fake.

It's an art piece. Pure design without any function. It's a concept, and one I do really like. Looks really great.

Comment thread in the Dutch subreddit[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2nv3gx/you_will_not_be_arrested_for_using_drugs_in/) Avoid the classic Pulp Fiction situation. As a graphic designer, I love how practically everything in the Netherlands is professionally designed. Isn't it usually possession that's illegal, not the actual consumption?In Australia, at school and university I was always reminded that no matter what the person has ingested, legal or not; it is always safe for them to ring an ambulance. They will only ring the police if there is a dangerous and violent situation.

Paramedics are there to save your life, not to criminally charge you.Little story about some of the victims involved in this.

2 British tourists collapsed on the street after buying and using cocaine that turned out to be white heroin sold as cocaine, both got brought to a hospital. 

After they get some medication one of them decides he feels fine and bails. When the hospital staff realizes he's gone they inform the police who eventually track him down that same night, he was quite easy to spot since the first responders cut open his clothes to get to his chest and he was wearing those clothes. 

He refuses to go back to the hospital, the police have no choice but to detain him and put him in a temporary holding cell where they continuously check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know the exact details on this but he stops breathing/heart stops, the EMT starts CPR. Gets picked up by an ambulance and dies on his way to the hospital.

Meanwhile, at pretty much the exact moment the other guy stops breathing too and survives because he decided to remain in the hospital.

Where in the world do you get arrested after going to the hospital for an OD?The red-light district in Amsterdam has some pretty dodgy characters. I found the tip is to never stop moving, do not even acknowledge the existence of people trying to sell you things and above all do not show how stoned/drunk you are. What are the three red X's in the upper left corner of the notice? A way of indicating urgency?Which shoulder muscle?Smartest public health sign I have seen in a long time.  Many people will read this because of the ""Cocaine Alert"" and most of those aren't planning on buying cocaine.

http://imgur.com/l9dmmQ0There's electronic signs all over the busy tourist spots conveying the same message. It's quite comical sometimes how dealers approach you so openly around the common bar areas like Rembrandtplein.Its amazing to see that they actually care and not just let drug users die.Here is a little story from personal experience if you feel like reading something. I currently work in the caregiver field for developmentally disabled adults. Upon starting the job, you find out that the mental illnesses you're dealing with are really just the extreme end of a spectrum that a lot of totally normal people with high IQs are also on. They're really not that different from us besides the fact that for a lot of conditions, their brain cannot resist the urge to do something even when it knows it's wrong. We can know better and learn and resist urges but no matter how many times I teach a client something, when the situation comes back up, the chances of them retaining the knowledge are unfortunately pretty low (but not impossible). With that being said, the following story is about someone with dev. disabilities, but the reactions their brain are having to the events in the story are totally normal and something that we all experience.

You quickly realize that the #1 trick to stopping acts of defiance in your client is to not give them something to defy.

For example we have one girl with oppositional defiance disorder. There is a set time for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, snack in that order. She constantly will cause a scene or have a documented behavior because she wants food at the times that aren't set for food.

Now she is an adult, and she should be allowed to have food any time, but we realized that it wasn't even about eating, it was that she HAD to break the rules. There was something about a rule for her that caused her to want nothing more than to overcome it and break the rule. It has a lot more to do with wanting personal control over your own life, but we call it the forbidden fruit effect.

So we solved her issue by taking away all snack times, dinner times, lunch times, breakfast times, and letting her tell us when she wanted to eat. When she wanted a 3rd or 4th snack we gave it to her. We weighed her after a week and she had gained 10 pounds in literally 1 week.

She was very upset and we explained to her the natural consequences of eating too much. We taught her how to eat healthy and feel healthy. We told her she can still eat whatever whenever she wants.

""No I want to eat healthy, I don't want to be fat.""

From then on she asks for one snack or no snack after dinner. She doesn't go crazy anymore trying to get food at times that she isn't supposed to have it because we totally took away the whole matrix of scheduled times and calories and all that stuff. We took away all of the rules to break and replaced it total freedom coupled with personal accountability.

I really believe a lot of the things people do, especially teenagers, are done 10x more because you're told not to do them. No one wants to be told by another human being with just as many flaws and shortcomings as them that they're not responsible enough to handle their own shit around some food or a drug or whatever else it is that's being forbidden.

**TL;DR A recount from an experience I had working with those with developmental disabilities that relates to the whole idea of the forbidden fruit effect. We took a girl with oppositional defiance disorder who consistently wanted to defy all the house rules and removed every rule and let her control her own life, but showed her the natural results of eating too much or not being responsible. She learned that being in control means it's on her and no one else to make the right choices, and she started making them.**[Gotta love Hamsterdam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHkrZECnfs)at night there is a LOT of coke dealers in the streets of amsterdam, most of them African (as in, actually recently from africa) ","[0.941726, 0.117224, 0.961212, 0.057378, 0.059729, 0.723, 0.0, 0.112, 0.261, 0.079, 0.761, 0.681, 0.795]"

I did not take this photo!! I found it on /r/newsokur. More people needed to see this.

This seems to be the source! but I am not too sure, anyone speak the language? : http://nurullah.net/article/Keske-Hep-Cocuk-Kalabilsek.htmlI know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it.Survey says...""This is not a camera""I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it?Those hats are adorable.I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this ""camera"". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. ""excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?"" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were ""taking pictures of people in their homes"" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police.I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, ""take my picture!  take my picture!""  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a ""hey, come here and look at this..""  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.  That is so fucking cute.I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were ""Are you guys about to widen the road"" and ""Don't take my picture with that"". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.  lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses. I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. ""Oh taking pictures, smile!""

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave. We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, ""It's actually not a camera."" Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, ""Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures."" With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole. I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!  Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks ""how do you ride that thing?"" I replied with ""I clinch my cheeks real tight.""Aw thats adorable!Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background.I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: ""I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera"". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off.I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.  Which would probably be the most boring subreddit.Used to annoy the hell out of me when I was working with a surveyor, ""Do you wanna take my picture?"" No, it's a theodolite, it does not take pictures, it measures angles and distances, and even if it WAS a camera, why on earth would I want a picture of you?I have always wanted to know what one actually sees when looking through one of those.

I temp'd at the Boston Beer Company's headquarters in Southie when I lived there for a few years, and this would have been in October of 2014. As the front receptionist, it was my job to sort through those postcards that came from the brewery and make sure nothing vulgar got through. Probably so that the many, many fantastical drawings of penises didn't wind up on places like Reddit and get associated with Sam Adams brand... 

I used to put stickers on dirty messages and still send them through because it made me laugh. Occasionally I even added a note of my own to the postcard if it was really funny. It was a really annoying part of the job because they come in huge bags, but it was also pretty fun because of hilarious messages like this one. 

You'd be surprised how much this occurs. Thanks, dad.

[Fly you fools](http://i.imgur.com/zCZLR1n.jpg)I work in one of the Wet Seal stores this is happening in and it's awful! Our sick time is not ""given"" to use, we have to accrue it like vacation days. My staff was given 24 hours notice before their last shift and my assistants and myself are having to work in the store by ourselves so corporate can avoid paying out extra money to associates. I also have an associate in my store who has been with me for over a month, her pay card was not activated by corporate and when we called about it we find out the lady in charge of that department had taken a vacation and literally tons of other girls were not receiving money on their pay cards either. This whole situation is crappy for all people on the bottom of the totem pole and I'm honestly just glad to be done with this company. Same story here in [North Carolina](http://imgur.com/j8b4jHn).  I know a store manager over there who has been told nothing but lies over the last month when questioning why their store wasn't receiving new inventory.  Classy company.  That's pretty fucked up. Not getting paid for your sick leave is par for the course... Most retail employees don't even get paid sick days. A $95,000 raise for the CEO is legitimately undetectable in terms of corporate cash flow. That being said, giving your employees one day to find a new job is absolutely awful. My girlfriend was a manager at Borders, the book store, when before they went bankrupt. The employees were strung along for quite some time, but eventually they came clean and said ""we're closing in 3 weeks, liquidate everything"". Most of the employees stayed during that time because it was pretty much the easiest retail job they could ever have for 3 weeks. ""What're they gonna do, fire me?""My partner works for H&M. He's a 5 year employee. He now has 5 weeks vacation, 14 days 'personal' time and healthcare for both of us (domestic partner insurance) that costs less that $50/month with a tiny deductible. I've worked for Apple, Samsung and Canon. I've never had benefits as good as he gets. 

Just chiming in to say retailers can do right by their people. as a stocky 30 year old male, I will be sure to never shop there again.From someone who is ignorant, why are so many Wet Seal stores closing?
Good for them. I have no idea what Wet Seal is but good for them. A month with no check, commendation to the person who didn't burn that building to the ground.Shitty ass corporations man. I worked at a pizza hut a few years back and they told us the store was going to eventually close, but never gave us a date. So I stroll into work one day and find the store locked, and closed signs all over it. Not even a call. Good riddance. 

I hope those poor employees find something else. A place where they aren't so much screwed over. They are lucky all the employees did is make a sign, and not just take turns shitting on the floor before walking outMy company's CEO got a $3mil raise last year while we were in financial hardship.Going to be a tough week for Wet Seal's social media team...if they even have jobs anymore.","[0.968337, 0.084177, 0.037523, 0.061465, 0.055768, 0.067, 0.0, 0.215, 0.274, 0.204, 0.455, 0.591, 0.777]"

> Jeeps were produced and packed this way for shipment to U.S. forces and countries like England and the Soviet Union who the U.S. supplied during WW II. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Richmond, CA, about 70% of production was boxed due to their close proximity to the San Francisco port.

> Boxing up a jeep was expensive and time consuming so it was only done when absolutely necessary. Jeeps that were crated were complete vehicles, not a box of parts — windshields were folded, wheels taken off and a few other things done to minimize the cubeage. Very few, if any, of these crated jeeps remained in the United States, even during the war. After more than sixty years, there are probably none left. Several organizations and dealers have had a substantial reward offer for years for anyone who can produce one and no one has claimed the money.

PartMy grandfather once bought a used amusement park ride on e-bay, and it came in a single package like this. Obviously it was much larger, delivered on a flatbed tractor trailer.

My family spent a couple weeks helping him assemble it in our corn field, but we had to stop just short of completion when it became clear that it wasn't a theme park ride, but some gigantic animatronic roadside advertisement for a Venezuelan brothel.Americans left a bunch of these behind in the Philippines after WW2 and filipinos turned it into an episode of Project Runway.Ikea supplies the military now?Fun fact: The tire tread on the jeep is designed so that it is difficult to tell which direction the vehicle was headed if you encounter a set of tracks.[75 years old this year!](http://m.imgur.com/1zXPME0?r)The orginal jeep was pretty amazing.

Ok, I got a response back from Arcaid. They told me the photo was placed with them by EWA, and gave me the name of a photographer, Friedhelm Thomas. http://www.ewastock.com/preview/83516

EDIT: 

I was able to speak with Friedhelm Thomas on the phone this morning. It was hard to communicate because of the language barrier, however I wrote them an email in English with a link to the image, asking if he took the photo and if he did, where it was taken. If they respond, I will post it here.


EDIT 2:

The photographer replied to my email, confirming that the photographer is Friedhelm Thomas and that they would respond on the weekend, when they have some help with responding to my email in English.


EDIT 3:

Friedhelm Thomas told me the photo is from 1985 and the steel and glass structure was dilapidated at that time. He does not know what happened to it since then.
The exact location of the photo was over the hotel Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo near Lake Como in northern Italy. The location of the “wintergarden” is Griante/Cadenabbia. The park belongs to Villa Maria, a variant of the world-renowned garden of Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo.

EDIT 4:

It looks like the Villa Maria has undergone a restoration since 1985.
Here is a [photo](http://www.mondolariano.it/GrianteCadenabbia/serrav.jpg) of it after
 restoration- [photo] (http://www.arteliberty.it/immaginiliberty/como/serra.jpg)

Another angle: [photo] (Here is a photo taken from abovhttp://www.alephcomo.com/Gallerie.aspx?gid=1&fid=1e:)
Here is what Google has to say about Villa Maria: ""Villa Marie is surrounded by a splendid public park, in the centre of the village. It was built between 1889 and 1892 for the will of Martin Clerc and was completed by a heir of his, called Josephine May. The project was realized by the famous architect Giacomo Mantegazza.""I'm always curious what would cause a place like this to become abandoned.

To get a mixture of the iron nickle alloy and olivine this meteorite came from a small protoplanet from the dawn of our solar system that melted from the original [chondrite](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/space/meteorites-dust/meteorite-types/stony/) material and separated into  an iron alloy and silicate phases (core and mantle). Towards the end of the protoplanet's life it experienced a very violent collision with another body and forced the contact between the core and the mantle to become perturbed via shockwaves from the impact- hence the mixing. 

Impacts like this lead to bigger and bigger bodies and eventually the terrestrial planets... so this is kind of an baby picture of the Earth.

Edit: [just wow](http://imgur.com/qBLSJ5s)I lived with a roommate who had a great dog.  I loved that dog to the moon and back.  But it would bark at passers by.  It's the single only aggressive thing she ever did.  We didn't want her barking at the neighbors or their kids so we used to say ""No, dog!  No barking!""  and she'd just look at us, then keep barking.

Then one day I kind of imagined what must be going through her head...  

She's like, ""OH FUCKING SHIT! There are some assholes outside our badass good-guy-team castle! They're THREATENING our goddamn HOME fuckin' BASE!! RARARARAWR RAHRAWR!!!!""

And all she gets from us is just, ""Bad, Dog! SHHHHHHhhhhhh! No Barking!!""

Panicked, she puzzles out the problem, realizing suddenly, *Oh SHIT! That's right!  You two helpless yet lovable lumps don't have the amazing sense of smell and super-dog-hearing that I do!*  But not to worry, that's exactly her job.  Let the humans know what's going on so they can let her out the front door to start killing shit.

Dauntless, she vows not to let the interlopers get by without warning everyone in the house first. 

""I WILL FUCKING PROTECT YOUUUUUUUuuuu! RHAWRHAHRAHRAWR RAWRRAH!!""

And suddenly feel like the poor girl is just trying to keep us safe.  So after I imagined this whole scenario out I kind of decided to try changing my approach the next time.  So the following interaction went completely differently.

She started barking, and this time instead of, ""Shhh, NO!"" I was like ""Good Job, pooch! I see them too!"" And I came up and patted her on the back.  And she chilled right the hell out.  Back to her nap.

I swear this worked 100% of the time.  She even kind of just started the habit of looking at me. If I was looking back she would just let it be.

""We good? Yeah, we good.""

I miss that dog.  She's old now but still healthy. My roommate and I moved out of that place.  He's got some kids for the dog to play with so she's probably very happy.  

But I felt like the damn dog whisperer when I pulled that mind meld shit with the dog.  I bet it'll work for others too.  Seriously try it.  Let me know.

[Edited some formatting mistakes]Am I the only one who wouldn't trust random strangers with this?Of course now he will forever be pestering passers by for treats, which could potentially make some people quite nervous.Now he'll learn to bark at strangers to get a treat. Cute idea, not solid in practice. On the other hand, that could be the lesser of two weevils.ITT:  Lots of people who don't understand how dogs work.That's a great idea! But aren't you afraid that he will warm up to strangers given this habit even if it's a robber in the middle of the night?Irish Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier? What if he accidentally bites someone and they call animal control?Has nobody noticed that they spelt it thaks, not thanks?I don't agree with this approach, especially in this context. Dog will grow to expect treats from strangers. What about the one time that the stranger puts their hand out and there is no treat?  I'd prefer food refusal from strangers and to engage/train the dogs with other people around in order to desensitize them.As great as this idea may seem, it's extremely counter intuitive.
I'm certified by the APDT and focus on dog psychology and behavior, and the first and foremost important thing to remember is that dogs are not humans and their psychology is completely different. Something that works one way in the human world can have a drastic difference in the minds of dogs.

I can go on for days as of why I would not recommend the method displayed in OP's picture, but I'll try to keep it short. I once worked with a 7 year old German Shepard named Daisy. Daisy had two bad habits; she would bark at the door when someone would stand outside/attempt to enter, and she was also terrified of fireworks. As humans, when we see that someone we care about is afraid of something, we tend to nurture them and tell them that ""it's all going to be alright,"" etc. People do the exact same thing with their dogs when they seem scared or startled; they pet them and nurture them. The problem with this is the fact that what you're actually doing, despite of your good intentions, is encouraging their fear. Petting a dog is a form of encouragement and by petting them or nurturing them when their minds are in a scared state, you're actually feeding into the issue rather than helping it.

Now, back to Herbie. If Herbie has a fear of bypassers, then having them reward her state of mind is not what you'd want to do. You have to make sure (this is really important!) that you reward the right state of mind. Dogs live in the now; not yesterday or tomorrow. You have to make sure you can comprehend what state of mind your dog is in before you start rewarding them with treats. 

Those are just my two cents...Fence aggression is caused by the neglectful action of leaving dogs unattended outside in a yard. 

The dog sees a passerby and begins barking. 

The passerby has no reason to stop and engage the dog and so continues on their way. 

The dog associates the passerby leaving as their having driven them off.

This gets reinforced every time that a passerby transits the fence line.

The real solution is to actually TRAIN your dog to not ever bark at passerby by staying with them during the first TWO years of their life when outside to properly TRAIN them not to be an ANNOYING noise disturbance, NOT hand the responsibility over to strangers that don't want hear your dog BARKING at them, not to mention the neighbors, and be tasked with doing what YOU should be doing.

tl;dr It's your dog, you fucking train it.Herbie The Love DogBefore:
Bark bark bark (get away from my home!)

After:
Bark bark bark (give me treats!)From a veterinary student: Never punish a dog to treat fear. You would be pairing fear with fear which strengthens the initial fearful stimulus. Just wanted to say that first so people don't beat their dogs when they cower at fireworks. Now for the initial case, giving him treats when he barks at people he will bark more. He thinks ""whenever I bark I get treats"". So you reinforce the behavior. Unfortunately there is not a great way to treat this one if the owner isn't present because people ignoring the dog and walking by makes him think ""barking at people makes them leave"". And if this is his goal, the behavior has been reinforced. However the case with fireworks is a little different. This would be an example of counterconditioning.

I live in San Francisco and I don't remember it being too contentious of a subject, but the Bay Area in general is dealing with the effects of extreme income inequality and gentrification right now. 

Plus some feelings might have changed after the clusterfuck that was super bowl city. Very true.  My highschool burned down in 1998.  It took us almost six months to even get textbooks.  We had to eat in circus tent half the next year.  There was even a proposal of taking all our money, building a brand new school on the rich side of town, and then give us the old school they were currently using in the middle of town.  They didn't even start building the new school a month before I graduated in 2000 because the idea of building a modern school on the poorer side of town was so controversial.  Granted it did only take a year to build from that point.  But I only had a school for two out of four years because of politics.Because the type of company hired to build a stadium consists of proactive doers. The type of company hired to fix a school consists of lowest bidders.Levi Stadium: Field of Jeans Because you're in it(school) three quarters of the year.

Edited for those that needed help.> Why does it take a year to build a stadium

Because it doesn't. Taking a quick trip [over to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium), here are the key dates:

* 2007: Santa Clara starts working on project to build a stadium
* 2008: negotiations begin
* June 2009: agreement is made between 49ers team and city of Santa Clara
* December 2009: owners of Great America file lawsuit, which is dismissed
* June 2010: voters approve plan (Measure J).
* 2011: 49ers begin pre-sales of seats, boxes
* December 2011: Santa Clara secures funding
* February 2012: 49ers secure funding
* April 2012: groundbreaking at construction site
* July 2014: stadium opens

If you include everything, it basically took 7 years. Even if you forget all the planning and financing, construction itself took over 2 years, and obviously there would have been a lot of design work before that (probably going back to shortly after the Measure J approval).Maybe your school is full of vandals./r/ToMotivateYouBecause it took longer than 1 year to build Levis stadium.

So the graffiti is a lie.


Not to mention school renovations and repairs are often scheduled around school days, so that education isn't interrupted by construction work. So generally there are major pushes to have everything in place for stages to begin and end over the summer months when students are out of school.Money is part of it - but also harder work. A hard-working owner/manager is chasing down the  contractors for any delays of his stadium - as a delay will lose him money.

Why are we even considering spending money on a stadium when we've got school districts who have been unaccredited for more than a decade?""

We are pumping out entire generations of children who ""graduate"" from high school with a 2nd grade reading level, absolutely no marketable skills, no hope for the future, living in bad areas filled with violent crime, and we are worried about a stadium?

It's only a matter of time until things get much, much worse around here.  We've already let things go for FAR too long, but when the AP students in a school only have teachers in 3 of their 7 classes in a day, what hope do any of them have at having a real life?

We have got a lot of work to do and meanwhile the deeply, **DEEPLY** racist people around here are all scrambling to find another major league team to come and let us pay for a stadium for them.

It's obscene how passionate some people are for sports in this city versus how utterly ignorant or apathetic they are about these important issues.  A few miles of freeway isn't going to protect us all forever and eventually, ignoring a huge swath of our population and basically relegating them to a life of poverty with the white flight epidemic in this area is going to come back to bite us HARD.

And in the meantime, people are suffering.

""Miller Man"" Maquette of large sculpture for ITW Welded Steel with a marble base 24"" x 7"" x 7"" By David Madero - 

I first used a Spectrum 875 plasma cutter to cut out the initial design from a steel tube. I then used a Millermatic 252 to spot weld steel rods on the tube as a base for the texture and the welding man figure. I continued by welding the gaps and unions between the steel rods leaving a highly texturized surface.  I finished the process using a Diversion 180 tig welder to form puddles giving the hills and valleys appearance.

Edit: Thank God, I figured out it's in the woods. I was just trying to figure out which state, because I was deer hunting in southern Illinois and had a wild cat scream at me. Everyone said it was a bobcat, but I found it hard to believe that a cat that size could have so much bass in its scream. It was pitch black at 4:30 in the morning. I had a shotgun. Nothing chambered and I have never climbed a tree stand so fast in my life. Way fucking cool more like it. Holy shit that hog is huge. I'd be surprised if the mountain lion actually went for it.A mountain lion snuck up on my tent while I was camping alone in Utah a while ago. Creepiest night of my life by far.

Edit: sometime around 2 am, I was woken up by a low moan that had a slightly aggressive tone to it (the moan lasted about 10 seconds). I grew up near mountains and cows and had never heard anything like that before. 

It freaked me out and I went from dead asleep to pulse racing at maximum just about instantly. I sat up and thought and listened for maybe 10 seconds then I flung open the tent and ran for the truck. I was wearing only underwear and the truck was 50ft away. I made it and rolled down the window a bit to look and listen. 

I had no weapons on me.

Total, I camped out there in the same spot for 3 months and this happened about half way through.

Years later, I listened to mountain lion sounds on YouTube and confirmed that it was a lion. He was maybe 20 to 50 ft from my tent and I think he was kindof asking a question. He was curious and wanted to see what I was. I never saw him and never heard him again.Where was this taken?

Eh, who cares?I used to be the guy that thought about leaving a note.  Then I saw this comic.
http://spillmybeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-parking-problems-comic-picture.jpgWhen I was a kid my dog got really sick and we rushed her to the vet. My dad parked shittily like the guy in your pic because he was in such a hurry to get the dog looked at. The dog died while we were in there and when we left someone had left a note under my dad's wiper saying he was an asshole for parking like that. I never saw my dad look as defeated as he did in that moment.

TL;DR - You never know what someone else is dealing with. I'm getting a beer.[deleted]That is clearly a tortoiseKeep in mind, it is not fair to judge someone's parking ability if you don't actually watch them as they are parking. It is pretty likely that the car you are looking at was forced to park like this due to someone else being parked improperly next to them.In High School, the girl who parked in front of me was 1-2 feet into my spot EVERY FUCKING DAY. I just let it go, but by the end of the year, I was like whatever, I'll leave a funny note. 

""Just so you know  -- (insert drawn picture of a ruler with an arrow pointing at the 12 inch mark)

you were this far into my spot every day this year. 

Best of luck with your future parking endeavors.""

She then made a point to yell ""asshole"" out the window at me whenever she saw me from that point on -- obviously not finding it as funny as I did. This is an incredibly passive aggressive way to behave.

I'm not a fan.I still don't understand why Reddit has such an obsession with people parking their cars badly.

Also, I think it's pretty fucking weird to type up some ""clever"" memo and put it on a stranger's car.

It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.""

The baby—named Grace Kelly at the suggestion of a visiting nurse’s wife—was adopted by Carmen’s sister. The aunt also cares for Yoina, who shaved her head in mourning. But the sad events did not stop there. Soon after, Yoina’s pet tamarin was killed when it overturned a boiling pot on itself. The family buried it.

When our reporter Emma Marris went to Manú, she sought out Yoina. The girl still lives with her aunt and helps care for baby Grace. On that visit Yoina had less hair but a bit more of a smile, in gratitude for the gift of a photo with her pet.""By Charlie Hamilton James. He writes: Yoina aged nine with her pet saddle-back tamarin. Last year I was shooting an article for National Geographic Magazine on Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon. I had travelled deep into the park to a community called Yomibato, home to indigenous Machiguenga people (aka Matsigenka) as I wanted to look at how Manu’s indigenous people live within the world’s most bio-diverse national park. Every day Yoina and her friends would walk through our camp on the way to the river to swim. The monkey would come with her, even though it hated swimming. To escape the water the tamarin would always try to get onto Yoina’s head, where it felt more secure. Life for Yoina and the tamarin changed dramatically shortly after this image was taken. Their story and the story of Manu features in the June issue of National Geographic Magazine and on the NG website.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7mRg74qcY&feature=youtu.be) of this bitch in action.A gif of the little thing 

http://static.businessinsider.com/image/556cd32d69bedd3c21964422/image.gifv>While the device may look like a toy, it’s certainly not priced like one. The PD-100 Black Hornet 2 prices at about $40,000 for larger orders of the device, said Ole Aguirre, VP of business development for Prox Dynamics. But considering that the Pentagon plans to spend approximately $2.9 billion on unmanned systems for the fiscal year of 2016, according to the Drone Center at Bard College, the $40,000 price tag doesn’t seem so significant.

So in other words its a drop in the sieve.russia is ready: http://imgur.com/a83Ewgchttp://imhur.com/a/a1RHO6s.jpgI'm just happy that MiMS found a new job.There's more to that $40,000 package than just the PD-100 Black Hornet 2.  That case hanging off the guys chest houses the display and base station for it.

For what it's worth, it's not a bad little drone.  While it looks low tech it has 3 camera's, has a 2 mile range, can hit 22 mph and has a 25 minute flight time.  Perfect for the types of missions it's designed for, which primarily being spec ops missions, means it's not like they are going to buy so many of these that it dents the nearly $3B unmanned systems budget for next year.

EDIT:  Also worth noting, the British Army has already invested in these, and I believe the Australians have as well.  I also think that the drone itself is cheap and most of the money is in the ruggedized base station and software.  The company advertises the drone itself as ""Affordable - reusable and disposable"" which leads me to believe that replacing the drone itself is probably something more on the order of one of the CICADA systems drones, far cheaper than $40k.Should've waiting for the Black Friday deal. No army deals for Turkey day.This will get buried, but my idiot brother is the one holding the drone in this picture.  When I called him to tell him he made the front page of Reddit and was basically a celebrity, he responded with:  

""...  Cool...  What's Reddit?""Makes me wonder if they have Drones disguised as bugs now that they using to spy on people with. Hence why the Russians supposedly stop talking when they see a fly in the room.If the manufacturer sold more than 50 of them, the price probably would be closer to what we'd expect to pay ourselves. The Noisy Cricket. ""I feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing!""

Edit: Thank you for gilding my first ever comment.Haha... As much as I hate seeing expensive items on my property books that are cheaper in the civilian side... The prices on those items also reflect the entire package of service, maintenance, updates, repairs... As well as contribute to the contractor support when you need a person to come instruct or provide hands on service. 

Ofc this varies between items, but for items sold to the government a lot of the expenses are passed directly into the govt because they will pay it. If a business provides something they need, the govt can always justify the cost of whatever the business says it had (eg it took me 400,000 dollars to make the tools to make this drone, I need to sell it to you for 40,000 to break even or make money on this since you're buying such a limited number of them) You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?Carbon fiber blades, gold plated axis, 4K live streaming camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, 2-40Hz microphone, ultrasound and infrared sensors, stealth absorption paint, facial recognition software with target auto detect and auto follow, satellite communication, radar jammer, micro laser canyon, stun/freeze ray, not to mention that the contractor, designers and builders need to pass FBI background checks and DoD clearance so it all adds up to US$45,392.13 - Bald Eagle Freedom discount of US$5,392.13 = US$40,000.00.

We had gotten to our destination, taken a few shots, and saw some big dark clouds in the distance. Really big. Really dark. It looked like rain clouds so we started racing home trying to beat the downpour that we thought was coming. A couple minutes later the clouds caught up to us and it started snowing.

We saw some headlights coming down the road and it was basically pitch dark at this point. The headlights stopped revealing a truck and the driver yelled at us to throw our bikes in the back and he would take us home. I remember we had been reading in school about Hiroshima and nuclear bombs, and I was pretty sure we had been nuked. The driver told us that ""Mount St. Helen's just blew up"" and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about but hearing the words ""blew up"" reinforced in my head that this was a nuclear war...or the start of one. Got home and saw the news.

That is how I found out that we have volcanoes in Washington and that I wasn't witnessing the start of World War 3.""Well, it's a good thing we didn't climb that one today.""I would just like to point out that in these pictures, Mt. St. Helens is 34 miles away. There had to have been some type of sonic boom that was out of this world seconds after they noticed the eruptionEven more intense are the [last photos from Robert Landsburg](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/234721-robert-landsburgs-brave-final-shots). 

""When the mountain exploded, he already had his camera on a tripod, aimed and cocked. As the all-engulfing cloud of ash climbed the sky toward him, four miles from the summit, he desperately cranked frames by frames across his lens, then rewound the film into its cassette inside the camera, wrenched the camera from its tripod, and stowed it in his backpack. His wallet was in the backpack too — perhaps to assure future identification.

Seventeen days later, his body was found in the ash, together with the film that cost him his life. It contained not only telling images of the killing edge of the blast but also the scratches, bubbles, warping, and light leaks caused by heat and ash, the very thumbprint of the holocaust.""I lived about 120 miles north, up in Snohomish, when it blew. Most of the ash ended up in Eastern Washington. [It turned day into night over there.](http://ecologicalsociology.blogspot.com/2010/05/it-was-30-years-ago-today.html)

edit: link My aunt and uncle struggled through the Great Depression then worked hard their entire lives. Finally they retired and built their dream retirement house on the banks of a river than flows from Mt. Saint Helens. Only a couple of months after moving in the mountain blew and they made it out with their lives with minutes to spare. Lost everything they owned except what they were wearing. Luckily their daughter had married a very rich guy and could take them in. But they never really recovered from the shock and died within a year or two after. I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time, and all I remember is that shit just about knocked me out of bed. Incredible BANG that shook the whole house, particularly my bedroom window. I hiked around Mt. Saint Helens in 1996, the side of the mountain that exploded was nuts.  There were areas where we were walking across fields of 1/2-inch round pumice that was deeper than you could dig, and then you would walk around a corner and be back in the forest for another few hundred yards, and then you would hit a line and back to the pumice field.  It was probably as close to walking on the moon as you can get without actually walking on the moon.  One of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.I watched it from our garage door about 30 miles to the upper left of this picture (meadow glade WA). Could never wrap my head around people selling the pens with ash in them...we could have made millions!Found this guy when reading up about this picture, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Randall_TrumanAny time I see Mt. Saint Helens photos I'm always reminded of Crater Lake (for obvious reasons). The crazy part is that native tribes were in the region when Mt. Mazama blew up to eventually become what we know as [Crater Lake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Crater_lake_oregon.jpg). Mt. Saint Helens was a huge deal even with the geology and volcano knowledge we have today. I can't imagine what had to be racing through their minds when Mt. Mazama erupted.

""Prior to its climactic eruption Mount Mazama had a summit elevation of about 3,700 m (12,000 ft). The present high point is Mount Scott at 2,721 m (8929 ft), 3 km (about 2 mi) east of the caldera rim. Today, the caldera rim ranges in elevation from approximately 2,040 m (6,700 ft) to 2,484 m (8,150 ft)""
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/crater_lake/crater_lake_geo_hist_133.htmlwhoa. thats terrifying. As a climber, theres always this thought in the back of your mind when you climb a volcano (even a dormant one) that it *could* erupt regardless of how incredibly unlikely that event is. Seeing this must have been a mix of emotions, awe, terror, dread, wonder, and concern for any one effected. 

Also, i'm 100% certain that those climbers were now facing extreme difficulty in returning to Seattle or Portland and were likely in danger from transportation/ash related problems. This is incredible. I don't think there's anything else to do at a moment like that except watch in awe.I was in Seattle when it blew and we all heard it. My dad and I flew from Seattle to California a couple hours later, and they changed our flight plan to go around it. I was a kid and didn't quite get the significance of what I was seeing, but my dad was jumping around in excitement climbing over people to get photos. He was a medical dr but his hobbies were geology and mineral collecting. (the mineral collection he spent his life collecting was donated to the Geology Department at UCLA and is in display cases lining the hallways of the geology building , if anyone is interested. Anyway, I think the guy in the window seat thought my dad was going to climb in his lap Would you stand and watch or run like heckDid they survive?If you're ever in the area be sure to visit Mt. St. Helens.

It's cafeteria in TCS, an IT company. Many companies display such data in the cafeterias.We did this at my summer camp to make kids aware of food wastefulness and not taking more than they'd eat.

They will not serve you more until you clear everything on your plate. If you don't eat everything that came out, you can't order more. You also can't take it home.

This actually pissed me off the one time I went there with some people a while back. They make you order as a table. I'm very specific with sushi, so I ordered 2 or 3 specific rolls for myself, but when I finished they wouldn't let me order more because the table wasn't finished.

You see, the other people at my table were ... well ... idiots. They thought, ""Hey, it's all you can eat! Lets just order everything, even the stuff that doesn't sound appealing!"". 

They ordered more food than anyone could eat, didn't end up finishing it, and as a result I couldn't order more. I even asked the waitress if I could go on my own separate bill, to which they said, ""One table, one bill"".

Im a little cranky this morning apparently lol.[In other words: Don't do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCLXZmMQNs)i know some all you can eat places get around this by charging a fee if your plate isnt empty when you ask for the bill. which i think is perfectly acceptable, wasting food is a shame. 

edit: to the people whining, or saying what if i have 1 shrimp on my plate, use some common sense people. if you have a few small items, or stuff half eaten cause you didn't like it you wont be charged normally. it's the people who've had 3 plates are pretty full but think they can do one more round fill a plate and leave it half full. 

and to the people saying how do they charge you for it? well buffets are a set price, when your bill comes there will be a fee on top, it's not rocket science.. I wonder if this is 100% actual foods that you could have actually fed 180 people with or if they just weighed the waste bin... It's ironic this is a sign at Tata. Fuck this company and everything it stands for.But is it gonna feed 180 people, if it wasn't wasted? What are they gonna do with leftovers at the end of the day?A retaurant in my town makes you pay double if they see you wasting too much food. If you don't pay, they kick you out. Not like we would waste anything on the first place, but there will always be assholes.We did a similar thing when I went to school. The cafeteria had a clear tube that red balls were placed in for every x kilo thrown in the waste baskets. There was also a mark on the tube, and if we were lower than the mark by the end of the year, everyone would get ice cream.Do they weigh just the edible waste or are they including bones and shells?

The kid on the right, on top of the van taking the picture, looks like it was photoshoped. I lived in South Africa for years. There is almost zero chance these are ""commuters"". This is almost certainly inside a park, and those cars are tourists specifically there looking for lions and other wildlife. Look at all the cameras. Lions don't just wander around Africa. They are very rare and highly prized tourist attractions, and they're in very specific, fenced (but extremely large, think hundreds, or even thousands of square miles) areas.

Africa is not huts and wildlife. Africa has cell phones and shopping malls and McDonalds and Adam Sandler movies, same as everywhere else.Nice BALLSMust not have been any dentists near the front of the lineNairobi is the only city in the world to have a national park right next to the city. People who live close to the park have at times encountered cheetahs and hyenas when coming back home from a night out. So yeah, lions can sometimes show up outside the park. But it isn't a common occurrence, though. TIL Nairobi drivers need laser pointers. Fucking cats man ... They do whatever they want and dont care who they inconvenience. Place a potted plant on a table in the middle of the Savannah with nothing around it for miles and you bet your ass a fucking lion will show up and knock it over.Those people in the front line of cars with their windows open, very ballsy.Lion 1:  They're totally looking at my ass aren't they?

Everyone else was either sleeping or partying, so I had the top deck to myself.  I laid back and wrapped a towel around my face to cut out any artificial light, and just had the most amazing time. I saw one big fireball that just took my breath away. 

When I returned home, I saw this picture on Reddit. I wondered if it was the same fireball. I thought maybe the photographer and I shared the same moment, he in the beautiful cold wilderness of Canada, and me out in the warm waters of the Caribbean, both of us staring out into the starlit blackness. Then suddenly a streak of multicolored fire races across the sky. Where is this?*sighs* can someone fetch the Doctor? There's a rip in the fabric of the universe again.Now *THAT'S* a fireball!

There were no street lights I walked on a gravel road. All of a sudden. I could see everything around me. I saw a group of deers on a field. At first I thought a helicopter or something light everything up with a beam or whatever. Then I looked up and it looked like a huge scar in the night sky. It was incredibly bright, and it grew really fast. After which it stopped and slowly faded away. Probably something you only see once in a lifetime.

Pro-Weed cars, Ticket Fighting cars, so forth.hahahahaha. In my town it's illegal to paint your car up to resemble police cars.

Mostly because of the fight your traffic ticket companies abusing it.The airport staff here use cars that say ""Law Enforcement (supporter)"" with lettering so small you would barely notice that last part:
https://imgur.com/B1i4MeaA friend of mine from high school bought an all black Crown Vic with the rambar still installed. It scared the absolute shit out of people in the school parking lot when he came up behind them. This used to be an RCMP cruiser that was brought over from Nova Scotia. Have ahd it for 5 yrs. To the guy with the suggestion it should be to protect and seal I beg to differ. To paint and protect is synonymous with to serve and protect and has double meaning. We work mostly in Toronto and west GTA. For those who's business we'd lose solely based on this - I wouldn't want your business anyway.There's thousands of painters in the GTA. I like dealing with easy going people and will gladly leave your business to the other painting companies. We are not impersonating anyone as it is pretty obvious and it's jusy that split of a second, if someone finds that offensive,  I feel sorry for you.This is a perfect time for my story.

It was in the early to mid 1990s in Riverside California. I was standing outside of a backyard party ($3 at the gate). I think the Voodoo Glow Skulls or the Assorted Jelly Beans or Schlong or some other stupidly-named band was going to play. 

So I was outside I was,  waiting for some friends when from down the street came a slow moving car with a search light. Pandemonium broke out because the party was about to be busted. Shouts of ""five-oh! five-oh!"" were heard. People took off in every direction. They jumped over the back fences. I even heard someone tried to put the keg in the washing machine. 

So I'm out there and I'm afraid of nothing because I'm straight and I don't have pockets full of marijuana or speed. 

Slowly, slowly, the car comes up shining the spotlight.

When it gets to the house, out leans the most Shaggy from Scooby Doo looking stoner who proclaims, ""OH!

[Shore breaks](https://youtu.be/EUXOZAinUPk)  
Other interesting facts about shore breaks.  
EDIT: Being from Hawaii I've thankfully learned how to duck dive under any wave, especially shorebreaks. As the name of the wave suggests, a shore break is a wave that breaks obviously close to shore. In my years of living in Hawaii I've probably seen a dozen of deaths because they either don't duck dive and get slammed from the peak down towards the sand or worse, rocks and reef. Another reason people die is that they stand at the bottom of the peak and get slammed with pounds of water causing back injuries or worse paralysis. It is fun to bodyboard or bodysurf these types of waves, however do it at your own risk. Learn to duck dive, never be afraid of a wave again.YEEZY YEEZY WHAT'S GOODI made this video piece about Clark a couple years ago, if anyone's interested in knowing a little more.

It was disgusting, but kind of cool looking.I made an animated version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4o1nbw/lightning_bugs_fireflies_time_lapse_my_backyard/http://i.imgur.com/b9lNrHQ.gifvYou would not believe your eyes Hey everyone, I should clarify, this is 6 images taken at 30sec each at ISO 3200 at f2.8 and merged using ""starstax"" which I usually used for startrail shots. There was about 6 to 8 firelfies in the jar total. I am a little surprised myself at this final image.It blows my mind a little every time I'm reminded that fireflies/lightningbugs are a real thing that exists in the world. It's like finding out Santa is real.I sat out on the back porch this past weekend for a little bit and watched the lightning bugs flair in the dark. It was a lot more relaxing than I would have imagined. Also, that's a lot of fuggin' bugs in that jar, man. How did you collect them?3 minutes? What was your ISO at? It's so noisy it looks like the ISO would be jacked up which (let alone the 3 minute exposure) would blow everything out, right? How is this just not a white image?Not a streak or blur in 3 minutes? Are you sure you didn't just stack your timelapse exposures?When my grandfather was a kid, him and his friends would catch a bunch of fire flies in brown paper bags, then go to the local ""picture show"" and release them so there were fire flies all up in the movie theater.Very cool, wish we had fireflies in FloridaThe noise in the picture makes it look like a quick render in blender.Beautiful!! I've never seen a firefly. Crap.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taZvug7hO3gGot misty eyed as they said ""Farewell""...To be viewed most pleasantly in conjunction with song:

take my land
take me where I cannot stand
I don't care
I'm still free
you can't take the sky from me

take me out
to the black tell 'em I ain't coming back
burn the land
and boil the sea
you can't take the sky from me

have no place
I can be

but you can't take the sky from meI like that you mentioned that you let them go afterwards. Many (most?) people don't think that tiny lives are worth saving and it's nice to see you be like ""Don't worry, they're ok!""

Any idea how many were in the jar? I can't decide if that's a shitton of fireflies or if it was just a few who were moving around a whole lot.I feel terrible about the wiffle bat genocide I inflicted on these little guys when I was a kid.  I don't kill bugs anymore (on purpose), but somebody should have smacked the shit out of me for that.Anyone else think Alice in chains and their Jar of flies album?

Also, wheres the Minnesota karma train?It's not *price gouging*. I think you should probably look that phrase up.

She was surprised and asked the mechanic if they replaced it yet. He said they hadn't but they could do it for 55 bucks. She asked if he could show her the dirty air filter that's in her car first. He was hesitant but she insisted on seeing the filter. They walk over to the car and from behind the glove box the mechanic removes a pristine air filter.

The mechanic apologized and said someone must have marked the paper work incorrectly or was thinking of a different car.  Sure they did...[deleted]>indicated that *are* price point...

This glaring error upsets me more than it should. My car wouldn't start. So I took it to my Ford dealership because I had 150$ credit. They said it was my battery. I paid 100$ for it because it had a long ass warranty and I was like fuck it. Next day it didn't start again. They said it was my alternator and it would cost 700$. I told them that is insane and hung up. They called back and said they talked to their manager and took 5% off. I laughed and hung up.

I installed the alternator myself for total of 120$ and 30Min to an hour of work. This being my first time looking at youtube videos.

Turns out that wasn't it.

I took it to a mom and pop shop and they fixed it in 4ish hours (dropped it off before work)for 100$ total and said the air condition was drawing power.

The Ford dealership makes money on commission. My theory was they were going to claim it was the alternator and charge me 200-300% overcharge and then fix the air conditioning problem and claim it was the alternator.

Fuck those crooks.Not bad. At the dealership I get my car serviced at they tried to hit me up for $1,900 in bullshit. All I needed was a 25k mile service. I thought out loud and asked him ""are you fucking serious?"". I could see the terror in his eyes and that's worth more than any gift card.Now come get your air filter so we can sell you something else and charge you up on labor to make up for the gift cards.Wow!  That's a pretty great decision on their end.  I'd do business with them.  Cabin air filters are like $10 and can be changed in like 5 minutes.

That thing is like 200km long.[This article](http://www.weather.com/news/news/chile-calbuco-volcano-eruption-evacuations-alerts) on the Weather Channel has more pictures and info. 

-first eruption in 42 years (1972)
-1500 people evacuated from nearby Ensenada
-it is considered a ""sparsely populated area""
-it is not the only volcano currently spewing hell vomit in Chile at the moment

Best of luck to those nearby!
A few questions,

-What are people supposed to do when you live this close to an active volcano? 

-Does the media play a positive or negative part when something like this happens?

-Can lava melt steel beams?Anyone want a quick volcanology lesson? Heres how this type of eruption works. Inside the mountain is a magma chamber, filled with liquid magma under pressure. In this magma are gasses dissolved inside it. Think of it like a bottle of soda, when you look at the liquid, it's just liquid; but when you release the pressure, the gasses come out and bubble up out the liquid. Same principle in this type of volcano. When the pressure gets too high in the chamber an eruption begins and the gasses in the magma are released out of the magma just like in the soda bottle. But the gasses also bring with it some magma that is quickly solidified into particles as the gas escapes, this is the volcanic ash. So the huge cloud you see is a combination of volcanic gasses and particulate magma known as ash, and at very high temperatures non the less. As the pressure in the magma chamber comes down the eruption slows down, and when the pressure has been relieved the eruption ends. Not a volcanologist, so this info is my synthesis of a complicated process from when I wanted to learn how this worked one day, and is a very basic explanation. [here is a time lapse Video of the erupting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljrDn3Gel4M)[deleted]Calbuco is the name of the volcano.

Dang, if you need a wikipedia image for ""withering stare"" this pic will probably do the trick.That haircut isn't regulation at all...but it should be.His dad looks like the T-1000 traveled back and ate too many peanut butter banana sandwiches> **milk**

Concise and accurate. Excellent marketing.If anyone is wondering what patch he is wearing, it's the patch of the 3rd Armored Division(Tank Division)Interesting that Minnie has a hairstyle suited to the 20s and 30s. Kinda like our grandma's nowadays have hairstyles from the 50s and 60s. Man, Elvis was a damn stud.Elvis is the coolest motherfucker there ever was. His dad looks like a bad ass too, and grandma looks like she's gonna whup the photographer's ass for taking pictures at the dinner table. Minnie Mae straight out of American Gothicthe wrong kid died!I miss the way foods were labeled in the 50s. What it was was more important than who made it. A tin of black pepper. A carton of milk. A box of... premiums.Pretty sure that's Ray Liotta Elvis guy here.

What strikes me is how modest the setting here is.  At this point Elvis was the biggest name in the world, with multiple #1 records and hit movies. He was already a pioneer in music (with several ""first"" concept albums already done) and basically the most famous entertainer in the world.

By 1959, Elvis beloved mama was dead and Vernon had already remarried (a woman who quickly asserted herself as the new matriarch of the family, much to Elvis' displeasure. She and Vernon lived in GRaceland with Elvis for a time but after she rearranged the furniture and changed the drapes, which Gladys had picked out, Elvis moved all her stuff out and sent her down the road to live with Vernon in a nearby house).


It's unclear to me where this picture was taken but it doesn't appear to be Graceland. The house changed a lot between 57-77 but this doesn't look anything I've seen. It may be Vernonshouse.

The point is, despite already having an obscene amount of money and a willingness to spend it freely on his loved ones, the  environment here is still so modest. It's partially because of the era and partially because. Elvis' family grew up so dirt poor that even this was considered a significant step up.Christ he's photogenic isn't he?Her head looks way too small for her body. She's on the same level as the Koopas in the Mario Bros movie.Was this before or after he stole his iconic dance off Forrest Gump?I bet you that was a damn good breakfast too. Oh, Minnie...

If anyone wants to see the rest of the pictures of this National Geographic story shot by Wayne Lawrence.I used to live in Flint, and these are the most well-dressed kids I've ever seen in this town. Private school? 
As a quick aside, I'm begging you all not to forget about Flint. This town has been getting screwed for decades, and people are finally paying attention. Keep pressing the issue, because the people responsible for this need to be held accountable. No slaps on the wrist this time. ""Back in 2016 I had to carry bottled water 5 miles uphill in the snow!""As shitty as the situation is little man looks sharp in the uniform.Fun story. I lived in Detroit for a summer in a house with no pipes and no electricity. It had been completely gutted. So no water, no working toilets, etc. It was pretty crazy but I grew up poor so it didn't feel as bad to me as it would for other people.

Background: my dad bought this house for hella cheap and moved out there. He knew what he was getting himself into and had plans to just rough it while he saved up to have the pipes re-installed, toilets and sinks and faucets replaced and get everything in working order. That never happened though. Life throws curve balls at us all the time. 

The summer of 2010, I went to stay with him since it was summer vacation from college. 

There was a lot of craftiness involved in living there. Being on my period was the worst. 

My brother (also lived there) and I would walk to the local library and brush our teeth there. We would stay from open until about 3 or 4pm and read and charge our phones. We were also able to use flushing toilets there. At home, we shat in plastic bags and then threw them away outside (tmi?) 

We were also able to get gallons of water at the store to bathe with. We would put water in little tin things (like for cooking bbq and stuff) and then use bar soap. We weren't the cleanest people but we weren't hella funky either.

My dad did splurge once when I was on my period and got me a room in a hotel so I could clean up properly. I was also able to wash my hair at the hotel which was nice. 

We didn't have electricity either. My dad and I slept on the floor in his room (brother was upstairs) and one day we went to RadioShack and bought a crank radio. We would listen to our favorite radio show at night. It was really nice. The sun set pretty late so we had a good amount of daylight to get stuff done. Whenever I would get home from the library, I would usually write or draw.

We ate a lot of fruit and bread and random snacks because we couldn't cook. My dad and brother also ate canned meats. 

It was a summer I'll never forget. It was actually one of my favorite summers in spite of everything. I knew that when I went back to school, I was going to miss Detroit. It's not the friendliest city in the world but for some reason the part I was in (the east side) felt kind of like the country to me. Things felt slower, homier, more neighbohood-y. It's hard to explain. But as much shit as people have to say about Detroit, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Most people don't know I've lived like this and wouldn't expect it. I'm kind of prim and proper at times and I'm about to get a master's degree. People with master's degrees don't shit in plastic bags!Gm refused to use it because it was corroding car parts...people expect flint residents to bathe in it?

Hhmm make it black and white and we are back to 1940 Maybe this is why we think old pictures looks so different. Because these are the photos that make it to the future. People in 2060 are going to think the same thing we're thinking now!Is this for showers, dish washing etc. as well?Stop commenting how much water that is for drinking. 

You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. That's a quarter bottle, per person, at least. You make your coffee. Two bottles. You drink it and wash your cup. That's at least a bottle of water to do that. Of course if you ate breakfast and your family ate too, you have to wash those, so bet on 10 bottles to do your dishes. You can take a shower, but the water is sort of blue today, which means the copper hasn't cleared the lines, and you broke out yesterday, so you just wipe up with a washrag. That's half a bottle. Per person. Minimum. If you need to wash your hair, that's an an additional 2-5 bottles, if you have long hair. 

You need to wipe down the counters, but you don't want to wipe lead onto them, so you use bottled water to clean up with, that's a bottle or 2. You water the dog, 2 bottles. THroughout all this, you've probably been sipping on a water bottle. 

You make spaghetti for dinner, that means 4 bottles for water for cooking, plus 10-12 bottles to wash out that many greasy pots and pans and rinse them, and you still have to wash everyone up for bed and get their teeth brushed, which is at least another three quarters of a bottle per person. 

Stop thinking of it as the drinking water allowance for the day. It's the only clean, safe, usable water in your home that can be used for anything but flushing your toilet, for the next 24 hours. Is that just *their* allowance or for the whole family? And wouldn't it be more efficient to distribute the water in gallon jugs?[Source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160209-flint-michigan-portraits-photography-lead/)please credit the god damn photographer.

Pardon my language and this isn't meant personally toward anyone but as someone from Flint, MI I say this:  Fuck off with using us as ""the state of America"" and all that.  Every 10 years we end up in the news for some ""look how the system has failed"" story and every time people act like they finally realize something needs to change.  None of you care in the bigger picture of it all.  A year or more down the road and you will have forgotten all about this and Flint will still be decayed and run down and left a shell of a city.  As shitty as this current situation is, it's been within a hair of this for DECADES.  This is just an interesting headline to the rest of the nation until it isn't any more.I apologize if this is not the appropriate place to post this, but I feel it may be useful since it's a highly visible post right now.

We are a band from Flint, MI (I currently live right downtown) called Sprowt.

Several bands, some from Flint and some outside of Flint, have contributed music to a $5 compilation album organized by Jonathan Diener (of The Swellers). 

100% of the proceeds are being donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint's Flint Child Health & Development Fund (flintkids.org).

If you're a music fan, please feel free to donate by buying the Not Safe To Drink: Music For Flint Water Crisis Relief compilation album at:

https://notsafetodrink.bandcamp.com/

The compilation album will be available on February 20th, 2016.

Thank you to everyone taking notice and doing something to help.

Put quite frankly, this whole thing sucks.Where can I donate?I can't imagine what I'd do if my kids had been permanently poisoned with lead. I'd go on a rampage.Flint is a disaster.  There's literally no quick fix and one that won't cost a huge amount of money.  Flint needs to be condemned and the residents should have their homes bought out at a fair market price before the crisis occurred.  100,000 residents + a quick google search showing that the average house price ~$100k = $10bn to buy out Flint. Probably a bit more than that, but in the ball park.  Shit, we spend way more to drop bombs on people in foreign lands every year.  I'm sure we can help 100,000 Americans out.

Also, more info on [Lichtenberg figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure)! This may sound obvious, but if you see something like that happening, don't go near it. There's other people in this thread who said that, but I'm not sure if everyone knows the reason why. It's not just because the person telling you to stay away thinks you're stupid and going to accidentally touch the line. Being near the line can kill you, you don't have to actually touch the line to die. 

An energized wire on the ground causes something called ""step potential"". Basically, the voltage in the ground is high near the wire, and decreases the farther away from the wire you get. If your feet are apart, the voltage between your feet can cause a current to travel through your body. Maybe it'll injure you, maybe it'll kill you. If you need to get away from something like this, shuffle away with your feet together. They used to tell us you could also hop with your feet together, but I guess they don't trust us not fall over, because that would also probably kill you. 

tl;dr: Just being near a burning wire like this can kill you, even without actually touching it.[Who wants a body massage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3GTNv9hHk)It's the Sha from WoW! Except real!I have had the experience of watching a high voltage line fall to the ground and arc several times after a rain storm. I was about 200' away when it fell. The sound, heat, and brilliant light was truly a thing to behold. The sound is a tortured and macabre screed in the most evil tone you've ever heard. The heat and light are incredibly intense. Unfortunately the sound drew my eyes directly to the fireball and it left an after image the persisted for several minutes. 

These underground vault fires are something special too. I have watched an attempt to put these out before. As I recall, it took this massive truck pumping insane quantities of CO2 into the vault to chill it before anyone could enter. 

http://youtu.be/0_jLmAB3leAReal Question: Shouldn't this wire be insulated?ShockingFractals. Crazy how they pop up over and over.Lineman here, can confirm, stay away. People,  voltage won't kill you, amperage will. The resistance of the ground changes everywhere, that's the reason for the lighting bolt pattern. What's cool is that along where the wire was on the ground (directly beneath the wire) it'll make crude glass, which looks pretty bad ass. 
Safety: NEVER touch a down wire. We are protected by step/touch potential by rubber over shoes gloves and sleeves, even then we still verify that the wire is de-energized before we touch it. Keep in mind de-energized does not mean that it's safe to touch. Had a worker bump a line with his leg that was down and de-energized but not properly grounded, didn't have his boots on because they were In a marsh and he got killed. Induced voltage from another line. If a wire is on the ground think of it as a bear or wolf, you get to close and it's going to maim and more often than not kill you... 

TL/DR: Never touch a wire on the ground, fear that shit like it's got a gun to your head. That's fracted up.Sha-touched groundA similar pattern grew on a CD I left in my car for over a year:

This fungus (Fistulina hepatica) has the effect of turning the wood a deep brown color. Once the wood has been cut and dried, the fungus dies, leaving a rich golden brown lumber.*

What a gifted craftsman.It's beautiful but somehow repulsive.The craftsman that made this chair was 78 years old. It was the last piece of furniture his boss Tom told him to make. It took him a year and a half to complete.

 As he worked his hands hurt and he felt tired. At times he wanted to cut corners and go home early. But did he? No, he worked harder and more diligently than ever. The sweat boiled from his face as he toiled. Final he was done.

 He showed the chair to his boss the next morning. ""Jim this is the finest work you have ever done."" His boss was very pleased. ""Why did you work on it so hard Jim?""

 ""Because the customer who buys this will live with it for a lifetime."" ""Through good times and bad, through all the seasons and all Hollidays. Memories will be made. Memories maybe I didn't get to make myself."" 

Tom looks at Jim and with a tear in his eye and says ""The chair is yours Jim."" ""The chair is yours Jim....."" ""It didn't take that long, considering I carved all by hand and from a single piece of wood.""That is a lot of work on a very unstable piece of wood. I hope it's kept in a very stable environment.I suppose everyone has different tastes, but this is butt ugly to me.

Was this the intent? wrex is that you?!Ashy Larry carves a two-balloh shit it's lavos!Why is there no information on this in the comments?  Does anyone know anything about it, the artist perhaps?is this a repost? if not, give more info on how it was done, tools used and shit, looks cool to tryKinda looks like that bigass snow Bahamut from the Monster Hunter games.These fetch $80-$100 on ebaySo that is where Tad Cooper is from!1. Billiard balls come in only two colours: white, and red (one of the whites has a small black dot)

2. That's clearly a pool ball.Gorgeous! How did you do it? Billiard ball is hard material.

How did you get the white out of it? Did you carve out the area & insert a white compound to carve afterward? I'm curious about the technique.

Beautiful piece!

Unless the guy who designed it was named Elvin...That's not even a mansion. It's the boathouse at Camp Topridge!

https://localwiki.org/hsl/Camp_Topridge

Now that's what I'm Tolkien about.Honestly, I think that's just a boat house. Or a boat house with a guest cabin. Also known as the Adirondack Architectural style. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Architecture [I knew i'd seen this house somewhere before - Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO6BgrnXcA&t=14m48s)House of Cirdan, the Shipwright.That woodwork is on pointde_lakeThat's a boathouse, not a ""private marina"".Looks like the Adirondacks.This definitely reminds me of the one of the inns in WoW. It's been years so I don't remember its name but it was in the level 10ish+ area near Darnassus.

Edit: I believe it is Auberdine that I am thinking of.But would you live there rent free if you had to give up Facebook? [Let me set the mood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yLjsWTNeE)If my hunt-and-seek games have taught me anything, there's a hidden microfiche in that house, and the boathouse has a spear, a starfish, a watering can, an umbrella, a mirror compact, a kitten, a  fish hook, three scarves, a TV remote, a flowered headband, a baby's rattle, and two pieces of a torn up photo in it.Honest question. What happens if the water level rose/dropped say 5-10 feet? I don't know about this area but around here thats pretty common throughout the year. Does the house float up to compensate? Is nothing kept on the lower level with the dock and they just let that flood? What if it rises over that level? Just curious if anyone knows.I work in this area often. This is Camp Topbridge on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondack Park of NY State. I turned in a quest there once where I had to kill 10 diseased boars.This is no mansion, it's a boathouse. Also a marina is a yacht mooring or harbor, this is probably suitable for a very small uncovered powerboat at most and, more likely, serves primarily to house paddle boats of various kinds.Oh to have money...I see the house in When Marnie Was There.

Americans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.  But I think in many cases a revolution just replaces the current bad players with a possible set of worse players.

CEDAR FALLS (KWWL) -
The University of Northern Iowa Police Department are asking for your help for information regarding the whereabouts of Adam Sailor.

>Sailor was expected to participate in commencement ceremonies today but failed to attend.

>He is around 5’ 9” tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

>If you have information regarding Sailor or where he is located please call UNI Police Department immediately. 

>UNI Police Department: 319-273-2712Wait why was she flying in? Graduation is only a few days after finalsThanks for David Johnson!Fellow native Iowan here, glad to see my home state on the front page for some reason other than the primaries...This is why you can't say *all* of the education system in America is bad.ITT: Iowans getting stoked about finding other Iowans on Reddit.

Note: I too am from Iowa. I've been in the UNIdome many times. 
UNI is great - I just finished up my first year, and I love it. From the administration to students, it feels very tight-knit. I have the opportunity to work with administrators, and they genuinely care about students. Once in a while the president (Bill Ruud, at the left podium) will just wander around the union and talk to people, he invited student government to his house. A couple weeks ago the Provost (Jim Wohlpart, on the right podium) came to one of the student senate meetings, and we had a great discussion with him. 

And he signs his emails with an interesting signature, ""Awe & Wonder"".
Honestly that really considerate of them.

At my graduation the women's lacrosse team was away at some championship game and came two hours late, and the faculty tried to make everyone stay. People were getting restless and tried to leave but they would get up and tell the students that it was mandatory to stay. 

Eventually they got there, instead of lining up and getting their diplomas they wanted their names called one by one so they could make a grand entrance and high-five people. They got booed instantly.Is the ceremony so important? I mean... I'm in Europe, but when my graduation ceremony was organized I had already moved to another city and started working, so I just declined the invitation. 

It's just an event, as far as I know :3Was surprised seeing UNI on Reddit... I completed my Master's there. I never thought I'd end up in Iowa, but can't think of a bad thing to say about UNI or Cedar Falls.

Except the -40 degree wind chills. Fuck those.Isn't UNI the school that gave us The Interlude dance a few years back?  
God bless that campus. /r/iowa

My guess is that your local building code won't accept the open nature of the stairs on one side -- because of the possibility of falls.Some Feeney cable rail would look great on those stairs for the right side handrail. http://www.feeneyinc.com/

Also, what kind of set up do you have? A studio? Or is it something more?Thats a pretty neat carpet design whered you find it?You people are crazy, or all in on a joke or something. 

Dirty carpet, ugly furniture, old ugly kitchen cabinets, cramped kitchen, all fixed and improved. Very good job, OP.I love the new stairs.  It really opened up the space.I'm surprised by how many people prefer the before. The only thing that I would see as a downgrade is the couch. On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Even though I'm only in my early-30s, plenty of Redditors are younger than that. The before reminds me of my first apartment, the second reminds me of what I upgraded into. So well done OP, welcome to adult-hood. Young redditors, you'll be there soon.

* The stairs, way less of a visual strain.
* I'll take hardwood over carpet, every day of the fucking week.
* Opening up the kitchen pass-through into the dining-area is great.
* Using ceiling mounted lighting over the dining area table instead of a floor mounted is great as well. 
* That arcade took up too much space for the area (IMO), good job placing it elsewhere. 
* Many other improvementsLooks great. I like how you swapped out the laminate for some foot friendly carpet. The gaming arcade and well stocked central bar are also nice touches! Very 80's.It is amazing

what throwing out old beer cans

can do for value.Based on the lighting, I'd say there's a window behind where the picture was taken.

That's when I noticed the big building behind the boat was moving.[side view comparison](http://malcolmoliver.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/oasis_titanic.jpg)[deleted]That was my job for 4 years or so.

It was incredible""Show me which Iceberg touched you, Son.""For the love of Triton, please tell me that has enough life boats.So much space for so many noro viruses.I spent two months on Allure when it still being built in Turku, Finland.  I ""technically"" helped build it by putting in the point of sale workstations throughout the ship (there are literally over 300 POS terminals on that ship).  I had an AWESOME outside cabin, and made the crossing from Turku to Miami.  I hooked up with a nice voluptuous girl from Wales (great body, bad teeth) and got very drunk very often.  We even had a kickass Halloween for all the contractors.

But after seeing how the crew lives, there's no way in hell I'd live on that thing.  Three months was more than enough time for it to get old, even with all the amenities.  That being said, the food was amazing, the shows were amazing, the Steiners were amazing (those are the insanely hot ""spa chicks"") and the bars (there are 17 on the ship) were kickass.  We tested them all (luxury of being a POS guy).

RCCL is a great company.  They're NOTHING like Carnival. Can't wait to see Titanic II make her trip from Southampton to New York in 2016. Best of Luck to Mr. Palmer, Hope it all goes off without a hitch, I'll see you in NY.It is the twin of Oasis of the Seas. Both same size... largest cruise ships in world.

He was actually really chill, loved to sit on the back of their couch and sun himself.. until one day in February when I walked into their house wearing my favorite red toque with a huge pom-pom on top.. now King (yea.. they called it King) decided the big red head was a serious threat and needed to be promptly dealt with. From his usual position on the back of the couch he was right at the door and at just the right height to bat me in the head with his tail (that probably made up 4 of his 7 feet and was at least 2 inches across at the base). 

Fucker knocked me out cold.. I woke up to the parents leaning over me and freaking out / appologizing, saying he'd never done anything like that before etc. etc... I was fine.. but I still don't like lizards..

I work as a mail carrier, and today I saw this HUGE turtle in the road, on a fairly busy road actually. So I put my mail in my bag and go to rescue him, all of the cars were changing lanes to avoid him (it was a two lane one way). I go in to grab him, and this white car comes up and isn't paying attention. He's texting and he doesn't change lanes.

I was one foot away from my turtle friend when he hits him going 45. Ruining my big little friend. He didn't die, but his body was torn in half and his shell was crushed. He lifted his head in agony and my heart broke. I'm a 25 year old man and I cried while I stood there. I couldn't save my friend from his fate.

Another car comes down within a minute or two and finishes him off. This time I was relieved he was no longer in pain.

I'm going down thisGrowing up in Carlsbad I've been to that pit on many occasions, seen the thousands of bats fly out of the cave in the evening on  a  few summer nights and even worked at one of the worst tourist trap restaurants in America, The Velvet Garter in White's City, a few miles from the Caverns a few summers in college back in the day.  If you're planning on visiting the Caverns one day, I recommend it but keep driving past White's City if you are looking for a place to stay or eat, you will thank me, I promise:)Yep that's Carlsbad. From that angle you can't tell but it goes down farther into the darkness than that. Those are amazing caves if you ever get the chance to visit.When you roll long into an abyss the abyss also rolls into you.Oh you should be there at sunset: about 60 kajillion bats fly out of it:

You've got it backwards. The terrifying pit into the abyss is not wheelchair accessible. The surface world is wheelchair accessible.[""worry not fragile one""](http://pbfcomics.com/270)I volunteered at Carlsbad for 5 weeks 10+ years ago  through the student conservation association. 

Fun facts:

* visitors are only allowed to walk down the natural entrance, they have to take the elevator up  (rangers/volunteers walk against the flow, so to meet more people)
* there are lots of formations that they don't tell you about; like a ll the ""lint-ites"":  lint from people's clothes that get stuck on the formations.  volunteers come in the summer to clean the cave. (with hoses and tweezers)
* it's 59 degrees and 90% humidity downstairs, while it can be 95 degrees and really dry upstairs
* the best lighted formation in the cave is not labelled.  it's  to the left of the elevator in the big room, it's called the ""virgin of guadelupe"" (rangers are not allowed to point it out)
* it takes 90 years for something to grow as big as the tip of your pinky (from the last knuckle to the tip).  They know this because a passage was created between two rooms for a tour, and the stalactites growing on the ceiling of that new man-made passage (in 1920; well; now almost 100 years old) are that large. (for the kings-queens tour)
* lighting was done by professional stage /theater lighters.  Lighting for cave pictures is *really hard*.  if you go, I recommend just buying the post cards.
[Speaking of a wheelchair accessible pit into the abyss...](http://i.imgur.com/6ghcdDq.jpg)I remember this place for all the wrong reasons.

Our family took a 3 week long road trip around America and we stopped here. It was myself, Mom and Dad, and 4 other brothers. 3 of my brothers went ahead while my other brother (call him Brett) stayed with me  (still ahead of my parents). I was 10 at the time and I just remember Brett wandering in a small circle in the middle of the path looking up at the top. I called out his name, he collapsed and I immediately ran and got my parents. People passing by offered and hand while I ran and got help from paramedics.My dad and Brett went back up while my mom and I continued downward (she physically couldn't walk back up the ramp). Terrified and concernced, we continued on the path with some of the darkest blackness we'd ever experienced trying to find my other 3 brothers. long story short, we find a ranger after a wn hour or so, describe my brothers to her and guides us to the bottom. Thankfully my brother recovered and we continued on our trip with just a 1 day delay.

TL;DR: On vacation here brother collapsed from a seizure and we lost 3 of my brothers in the cavernWas there last weekend. Can confirm, there was a guy who almost ran over my toes with a motorized wheelchair 750 ft below ground. Probably took the elevator though.

I still remember being around 3 or 4, way to old to get away with this, and suckering my aunt into carrying me down into that pit:)  She was the best and must have know I was being a little bastard but never complained

This is a great example showing why honey bees die after stinging something only once. Their stinger/venom sac are attached to other organs inside the bee, so when the stinger's barbs lodge into something, everything gets pulled out, potentially including gut, etc and leaving a gaping hole in the bees abdomen.

Another interesting fact: the stinger that gets left behind is composed of the stinger/barb, the venom sac, a layer of muscle tissue surrounding the venom sac and a nerve ganglion attached to the muscle. Independent of the bee, that nerve ganglion continues to contract the muscle around the venom sac, pumping more and more venom into the victim even if the bee has run off.  This is why when you get stung by a bee, you want to scrape the stinger out ASAP with a flat tool. (Don't try to pull it out with your fingers, you'll just squish the venom sac and empty it all in at once).[deleted]If I ever have a metal band, this will be the cover to my album.Spiderman.  Venom.

For the longest time we assumed it was the cat, but had no proof. Until one day the entire family came out of the house and the cat is sitting near the porch with a stick in its mouth. It saw us, dropped the stick and sat on top of it so we couldn't see it.

My dog does the same thing. I use his pile as kindling in the winter. He helps bring it inThose are collectable sticks.

Either way, shit is cute, yo. He must think he's a millionaire. Imagine how devastated he'd be if they were all gone. I think your dog is trying to tell you something by creating a large bundle of sticks outside your house and its not nice.From an animal behaviour standpoint, why would a pet or dog do this?  I can see it thinking of it as a positive reward if it brings something back to it's pack (in this case, the owner).  Or maybe it just likes chewing on sticks (it could help dental hygiene, be entertaining, seem like a replacement for doggie toys or actual prey), and it drops them in the same spot near the house before it goes inside?  Or maybe it's akin to a nest-building tendency in other species to collect things from around their environment that could either provide shelter or potentially impress a mate.I believe your dog is a hoarder.

The play event in the middle, a spring rider, is classified as a ""sitting-rocking motion event"", and as such, has a 6' ""use zone"" around it, in which no other play events can be located. It looks to me like that's a 13'x15' space or so, so *just* big enough to accommodate this thing. Furthermore, they wanted accessible seating and trash disposal, meaning you need wheelchair-traversible surfacing all the way around both features (the bench and bin). Finally, at that point they probably live in a place that requires fencing around non-supervised play areas, so naturally to save money, they made it as small as possible. Honestly, you see shit like this all the time, where people don't understand the cost and rules of commercial play equipment.
  
tl;dr - there are tons of stupid rules for playgrounds that lead to things like this.Gotta keep all that fun caged in.Good thing there's a fenceI instantly envision a kid on that little bike who doesn't even want to be there and an over caffeinated dad, sitting on that bench yelling, ""HAVE YOUR FUN, BILLIE...BOUNCE HARDER, SON...

It was literally just a bench, some flowers and a sign that said ""The Park"". So by law in that county or city or state, not sure which, registered sex offenders couldn't live within a certain area of the park. This also applied to schools, daycares or any other places kids meet. So any of the registered sex offenders had to move.
This may be a similar situation.

[It looked like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Comptometer_model_E.png), but the copper body was pretty heavily tarnished and almost black like a really old worn penny. However, it still worked. After taking everything apart (there were hundreds of individual parts: springs, levers, gears, etc.), lubricating everything and polishing the copper shell it looked even better than the photo above, like a shiny new penny. It was incredibly impressive to see how such a complex device was put together (and very satisfying to be able to take it apart and put it back together without screwing it up!). I took photos of the inside, which I don't have access to right now, but [here's an internet pic of the inside with the shell taken off](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/08/comptometer_interior.jpg).

Colima is like that.  It's rather young (about 5 million years), rather tall (12,595 feet with a 2,000 foot prominence), and highly active (more than 40 eruptions in the last 500 years).  So it's not that difficult to end up getting awesome pictures of it.

It's also a Decade Volcano, one of 16 in the world that are given extra research and study due to their activity levels, destructive eruptions, and proximity to population centers.  There have been five eruptions at Colima in the last 18 months.How do you take an 8 second exposure but not have lots of blur from the moving smoke and possible vibrations in the ground?r/EarthPornDo you want to become my desktop background? Because that's how you become my desktop background. That backdrop is really what makes this photo shine. Just the stars in the background seem to really help this excellent shot pop out.It still feels entirely unfair to me that volcanos can *also* produce lightning. Like, what can't they accomplish? They create land. They create atmosphere. They royally fuck shit up under the right/wrong circumstances, depending on your point of view.

http://i.imgur.com/B3FUlc2.png...Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, Bosun's Mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.Practically all people on the ship are black, practically all people in the water are white.

But also for an entirely different reason--realizing this is /r/pics and not /r/aerodynamics, anyone not interested in aerodynamics turn back, move along, nothing to see here...

This is the first visualization in the natural world (i.e., not in a wind tunnel) I've come across that illustrates adverse yaw, the use of differential aileron to correct it, and the effect it exerts on the tracking of ""wake"" or wing tip vortices.  As anyone who has spent time near a major airport knows, the little whirlwinds that stream off wing tips or edges of flaps--and which the **[newish winglets](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/24/business/Why-Winglets.html?_r=0)** try to combat--descend after the plane has passed and can make a crackling noise or disturb the tops of trees when they descend to ground level.

If the pilot is skimming above cloud tops as in this photo, those vortices will descend behind the plane and the combined **[""downwash""](https://tianyizf1.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/trailing-vortex.jpg)** from where the tip vortices meet will disturb the clouds--that's why we only see one ""slice"" caused by the two tip vortices in this image, but **[this photo](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/downwash.html)** of a business jet penetrating just the tops of the clouds illustrates the two separate wing tip vortices.

However, if you look closely, notice that, as the aircraft banks to the right, the slice is displaced to the outside of the turn, to the left of the aircraft track.  The reason for this is asymmetric induced drag--the downward deflecting aileron that raises the left wing tip causes a momentary increase in what is known as induced drag.  Simply said, banking to the right makes the left wing tip vortex stronger than its counterpart on the right.  The increased lift caused by the lowered aileron causes that wing to pull up and back harder than the right wing is ""pulled"" down, whose aileron is up.

That increase in drag would tend to pull the nose of the aircraft to the left, towards the outboard wing, which is a bad thing from an aerodynamics stand point--it requires more rudder to maintain coordinated flight, and thus, more drag to overcome, so higher fuel costs.  So a concept called **[differential aileron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/DifferentialAileron.svg)** is employed to cause the inboard (right) wing to raise the aileron more than the outboard (left) wing lowers its aileron.  But here's the key: the raised aileron results in more drag, but largely in the form of separation drag--that's when the air doesn't flow smoothly over the upper wing surface, but starts to get more turbulent.  This disruption in airflow causes more drag to be generated across the wing, but keeps the amount of outward **[spanwise flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:Tip_vortex_rollup.png)**on the upper wing surface lower. Spanwise flow is responsible for initiating wing tip vortices and winglets attempt to minimize it. The end effect is the generation of a smaller wing tip vortex on the inboard wing.

We're in the home stretch: when the two wing tip vortices combine, one stronger, the other weaker, their interaction causes the net downwash of airflow in the wake of the aircraft to track toward the stronger wing tip vortex, and thus as they descend, will veer to the outside of the turn.  Furthermore, the bank angle of the aircraft will accentuate this effect, as the lateral force component of the stronger wing tip vortex will bias the downwash to the outboard side. This is what we can see clearly from this otherwise picturesque, very cool shot.

**TL;DR: Perfect visualization of induced drag in a turning aircraft which biases the downwash to the outside of the turn.**

NOTE: For the pilots and perfectionists here, though the pilot eases up on the yoke/stick input that initiated the turn after the bank angle is established, a little bit of inboard bank input is held to prevent the natural stabilizing effect that aircraft with dihedral experience, which requires more lift on the outboard wing to counter the increased upward lift component on the inboard, more horizontal wing, which still results in a differential in induced drag between wingtips.  These changes in control surface input during turns are responsible when you see **[strake/LEX and wing tip vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:FA-18C_vapor_LEX_and_wingtip_1.jpg)** appear during airshow demonstrations more prevalently as hard turns are initiated, which then dissipate/disappear when the pilot establishes bank angle and/or unloads.BEWARE!

And then they think, this person is holding out on me, being all coy backing away instead of giving me my chicken nuggets! And then they follow the person, who perceives it as aggression.

You can't relocate an alligator; they've fought other gators for the right to whatever territory they live in and they *will come back.* They will come back.

It *ruins* an alligator when they begin to feel comfortable associating with humans. I don't know of a single state that actually ""removes"" alligators--relocation doesn't work. Nine times out of ten, any pest control or park service you call will end up euthanizing any gator they've received a complaint about.

Here's a series of articles about a 50 year old gator who caused some ruckus in my town last June:

* First, someone saw him and complained. So he was removed.
* [Then he came back](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/03/3143848/whopper-gator-found-hilton-head.html) to his original location
* Someone complained that he was relocated rather than killed, so [an investigation started](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/04/3146663/large-alligators-release-to-be.html)
* A resident said that the gator [wasn't aggressive](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/07/3151999/hilton-head-islander-speaks-up.html)
* But the pest control guy lost his contract with the city anyway and the 50 year old, 1000 pound gator was killed.
* Some people [didn’t think the guy should’ve lost his job](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/09/3203948/petition-supporting-gator-wrangler.html)
* That's when things got really interesting. Another alligator was hit by a car on one of our busy highways in town. The city, having just terminated their contract with the-guy-who-handles-this-sort-of-thing, didn’t have anyone to go and pick it up. So, over the next few hours and in the ensuing traffic jam, all of our tourists and residents were treated to a delightful viewing of this alligator’s slow death in the median. [Article](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/03/3195631/maffo-critter-management-lose.html)


So, here are some tips for next time you see an alligator during your vacation:

* Respect them. Take photos from a respectable distance.
* Do not approach or harass them. They are not in a glass tank and they are not here to entertain you--you do not need to interact with them.
* Do not pick up, approach or harass their babies. Alligator moms actually do stick around their young and nurture them.
* Take care to look after your own young children and pets, as those are the most likely things an alligator will mistakenly see as food.
* Please don't call animal control just because you *see* a gator. Only call animal control if the animal is behaving in an aggressive way, or approaching humans. Gators who are minding their own business don't deserve to be euthanized just for existing.
* For the love of god, do not attempt to feed them chicken nuggets.So what's the legal standpoint of shooting one that's in your yard?[Alligators are some scary shit.](http://i.imgur.com/wY5BZ.gif)

- Can you control the thickness of the layer to a great degree?

- Does the hardened resin let you ""scrap off"" paint that you've laid down?  Either fresh or after it's dried? I've worked a bit with oil but I'm not sure how acrylic behaves exactly or how dense and hard the resin is for scraping.

- Please try [this!](http://i.imgur.com/M40mAQ0.gif) These stereographic images are easy as pie to make.  Just take two pictures of the same focal point on the piece, but a couple of millimetres apart (more or less, experiment a bit perhaps).

As /u/and_what_army said then:

> This family has already been through hell. A child with seizures is hard enough, but by the time they go on a Keto diet it usually means traditional treatments have been exhausted and all the normal medicines (Banzel, Klonopin, Depakote, Diastat, Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, and probably others) don't work. Keto as a medical treatment is much harder than Keto for weight control. Fletcher probably had to go into the hospital for 2-3 days while he adjusted to being on the diet, and now everything that passes his lips must be weighed to the 1/10th gram. He probably can't even wear the wrong kind of sunscreen, because anything on the skin could affect the body chemistry for the Keto diet.I ordered a bag of glow-in-the-dark toys for kids who want them or who can't take candies. I also printed signs that read, ""**Toys available for kids with allergies. Shots available for adults with kids.**""

I spent more on Jameson and little plastic glasses than toys and candies, but it's probably a decent investment to build some goodwill for my first Halloween in the neighborhood.

Edit: Thank you, anonyperson, for the Gold. It's a real treat.My son does not have medical restrictions on his diet.

Nonetheless, I eat his candy.

Because I am a responsible parent who goes the extra mile.Here's what I do as a crazy irresponsible parent with a kid who is actually severely allergic to peanuts (I say actually because many people claim to be who aren't, seriously).  We go trick or treating and do not burden our neighbors with anything.  Fill up the bag with whatever!  Then when we get home we break out the safe treat bag and start the trading.  He couldn't care less because he doesn't know what he's missing and loves red-vines, skittles etc.  We can usually redistribute most of the unsafe candy back out to the remaining trick or treaters, and what is still left over goes to work with me (although it might not all make it further than my desk).

First lesson with allergies; it's on you to manage it.  I've had people actually say to him ""no it doesn't have peanuts in it, just peanut butter.""  He learned how to read ingredients at 5 and he's managed it pretty well.I had a step child with PKU and a child with other unrelated food allergies. Our solution was to let them go hog wild on Halloween and get as much candy as they could. I would then pay them $1/pound for the candy and we would go and buy a toy the following weekend. I'd take the candy to work and then I didn't have to worry about the kids sneaking candy they shouldn't have, they got to experience Halloween the same way as all the other kids, and they got a new toy. It seemed to work pretty well. Just a thought for parents who would like their kids to have the experience but don't have the time to send out nice fliers with attached toys.Plot development: One of the receiver of the letter bought an angry bird costume and introduced himself as Fletcher on halloweenThis is the kind of thing my cousins family would do. Ever since he was an infant he's been deathly allergic to a long list of things (walking past a boiling pot of wheat-based pasta once triggered an asthma attack from the vapour). 

The family didn't turn the house into a bubble, they didn't ban anything coming into the home. They just made a little sign on the door informing people that someone with severe allergies lives there and to please follow some basic steps to avoid any issues (they'd always mention it to a first-time visitor though). Simple things like ""Please wash your hands after eating or handling any food products"", having a cupboard strictly for his dishes and food, no perfume. 

*He* was taught to watch for things, wash his hands religiously, and to bring his own stuff (like popcorn to theatres, letting the staff know of the allergies), not to rely on other people who probably have no clue. He's nearly 20 now and still very much alive.

In many ways it's comparable to a disability. Yes society adapts to a point but it's really up to individuals to learn how to live with it.

(Edits for clarity...and spelling)Active vs. Passive parenting. Not trying to bash the other post, but *this* is how to properly handle your child's allergies/diet on Halloween.This doesn't belong to me, but the 'responsible' parent who posted about her kids peanut allergy pissed me off and reminded me of this awesome parent.

EDIT: Front page! thanks

EDIT: GOLD! Thanks!This could just be an elaborate ruse to find out ahead of time which houses to skip over in order to maximize the Halloween haul. 

My record is 5 1/2 large pillow cases loaded with candy within the 2 hour window, but this type of info could really help me out. After all, I turned 37 this year, and my legs aren't quite what they used to be.How irresponsible to name your child ""Fletcher.""With all the weirdos, allergies, and special diets out there these days, it's really a wonder that trick or treating even exists anymore. I have epilepsy and had to go through this same ordeal. However, instead of parents handing out toys, my parents just said I was too old to trick or treat.

While it is very beautiful and sweet smelling, its has the ability to escape its ornamental confines in vine form, and then establish itself in the wild, where its aggressive vines creep around the forest floor, choking and out-competing many native understory species. Furthermore, sizable trees have been killed by those creeping Wisteria vines. When these large trees are killed, it opens the forest floor to sunlight, which allows the Wisteria seedlings to grow and flourish even more. 

Also, anyone who wants to see a good list of invasive species that are often sold at garden centers you should *definitely* avoid planting in your yard (depending on your zone), see [THIS LIST](http://imgur.com/a/PCLez) I made. If anyone DOES want to plant Wisteria, I would recommend [American Wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria_frutescens), which is just as beautiful, but does not have the invasive predisposition the Asian varieties do. The reason the Asian varieties are favored in ornamental application is because they emit a very intoxicating fragrance, while American Wisteria does not.

ITT: Michiganders and slightly confused and disgruntled New Yorkers>Coney Islands are a unique type of Greek American restaurant. Two of the most well-known Coney Island restaurants are the Lafayette Coney Island and the American Coney Island, which are located adjacent to one another on Lafayette St. in downtown Detroit. They have a common root, with the original restaurant having been established by Greek immigrant brothers Bill and Gus Keros in 1914. The brothers got into business dispute soon thereafter, and in 1917 split their restaurant into the two establishments that exist today.

>The menu of all Coney Island restaurants centers on the Coney Island hot dog, which is a natural casing hot dog in a steamed bun dressed with chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard. This item is usually referred to simply as a ""coney."" Another popular item on most Coney Island restaurant menus is the ""loose hamburger,"" which consists of crumbled ground beef in a hot dog bun, covered in the same condiments as a Coney Island hot dog. Many Coney Islands also serve ""chili fries,"" which are french fries covered in chili, sometimes with mustard or cheese added.

>Many Coney Islands offer other Greek and Greek-American dishes, such as Gyros, Souvlaki, Shish Kebab, Spanakopita, Saganaki, and Greek salads, as well as usual American diner fare, such as regular hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, and desserts.

TILThis is the place at 6 and Haggerty, right?ITT: Coney 2015You have a Coney Island?From Michigan, outside of Detroit, still blows me away no one else in the world knows what a coney island is. This place runs on Coney Islands.

Edit: Glad to hear these are popping up elsewhere. I'm just used to puzzled looks when I mention a coney outside of the areaI'm so excited to see a post about Coney's on the front page! Also so cool to see the interest from non-Michiganders. I grew up in the Detroit area where they are everywhere however I'm in Lansing now and there are only a few.

The most important things a coney must have, to me, are as follows:

1. You can get both Detroit and Flint style.
2. The place is a little gritty (which is why I prefer Lafayette over American, the atmosphere in there is amazing)
3. Someone working there has to be speaking (or yelling) Greek. If they are, you know the place is legit.
4. Bonus points if they have Vernor's and Boston Coolers (basically a ginger ale ice cream float)
5. Saganaki is always a bonus (OPPA!)

Cheers to all my fellow coney  connoisseurs![deleted]I just talked to the owner of this restaurant for a news story about this. What a sweet man! He told me that he lived on a farm in Greece with seven brothers and sisters, and his parents couldn't afford to send him to school. He left home when he was 12 and went to Athens, where he was homeless, and depended on the kindness of others to give him food. He said he does this every year because ""It makes my heart feel good to do it, and help a little bit."" This has to be metro Detroit. Not aware of any other place on earth with Coneys. [deleted]This guy understands real life. Good job Coney Island guy.**#Coney2015**""...my local Coney Island""?

As a New Yorker, this is confusing. That's really nice and all. But I am a national Coney Island man. Give me a hani and cheese fries as my last meal. And the answer to the big question is Lafayette.

Great memory. But neither of them has any taste in footwear apparently...No he doesn't. He just dyes his hair.It's like Edward Norton and Alec Baldwin had a kid.Hair coloring will do that for you. Just ask Paul McCartneyJason Star is the real life Billy MadisonAfter seeing how all these old celebrities look, I'm convinced heavy drug use is the key to looking young.Ringo looks surprisingly young for a 75 year old. Does he just use good hair dye, or is he splicing up on young blood?

I wouldn't blame him if it were the latter. After all, the transfusion of young blood into an old body has rejuvenating effects, if the lab mice are to be believed. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a hidden market of ""blood ministration"" that certain individuals keep secret.

Tom Bergeron was on Stern a few years ago talking about when he was really young he interviewed Larry and he paid him like 30 bucks. While he was interviewing him he mentioned Moe and Larry called Moe and told him the kid had 30 bucks for him so Moe drove there immediately. He said they lived in shoddy houses and Moe's car was an old broken down mess. The studios ripped those guys off, for just the amount of hours I've watched their shorts and movies, they deserve thousands of dollars.Correction, two Stooges and Curly Joe.

Then we start to change a lot again as we enter the end of life years 50-75.  It's not just he presidents, it's most people, except those strange freaks who seem to never age..

http://imgur.com/CgtqHamNaw look! He was smiling in the first photo, and now he has his mouth open. Being the president sucked all the joy and life out of him and crushed his will to be happy forever /sHe looks a bit skinnier now.Anyone else amazed with how fast time has gone by? I remember him being elected as if it were yesterday... 8 years.. Goddamn.I would bang. Being president ages a person. Look at before and after pics of any of them. Looks the same. George Ws hair actually got darker for a bit after he left office.You may notice the vein on the side on his temples has become much more pronounced. Along with the obvious graying of the hair. I guess being the leader of the free world will do that.The microphone looks good, perkier even.That man has seen some shit...aliens?Can someone share a pair of pics of themselves now and 8 years ago to see the normal rate of growth.thank you, that other picture was pissing me off.  It's was like a before and after infomercial where they have terrible lighting on the beforeEven this picture is giving a false impression, albeit the opposite one in so far as it tries to make him look older in the before picture. The picture of him when he was younger has him smiling widely which of course creates wrinkles and lines as the muscles of his face contract. This lessons the impact of any permanent lines on his older picture. 
  
TL;DR A better comparison would have the same facial expression in both and no wide smiles. TIL people ageHe was greying a bit in the first, and then 8 years later he is even more grey. Hmmmmm. How the hell?Wasn't your mole on the other side...?

Rather than use a still from the video like a lot of other news agencies are, deny IS their sadistic pleasure by not showing any image of their atrocity at all. Sadly, my first thought was ""Holy fuck, that's an expensive page of ink"".

But, as a designer myself, I realize it serves its purpose, so it's worth it.Quite the classy move. A picture of the gruesome act would probably sell more papers but they chose to pay their respects instead and report the facts. Glad to see this. From what I read about the poor guy he really did seem to have a big heart and compassion for people in that region and for the independent to print this on this front page conveys that sentiment. 1. I dont know the name of the killer.

2. Didnt even see a picture of him.

3. They didnt show the video.

This is everything they should avoid to do and they did. Instead i know who was killed and where my prayers should be going. I like this, other news magazines should write down some notes.i think this is getting more of a reaction...which is what the papers wanted anyway.The Indie has a grand history of great front pages. David Kelly's death was particularly spectacularly well done as I recall.ISIS guy 1: dude, you know what we can do to get people in our side?


ISIS guy 2: I dunno.


ISIS guy 1: We find an innocent man who is out helping people, and KILL him.


ISIS guy 2: You are so smart.


The fucking logic is non existent.I feel this almost gives it a power in itself.

I still respect the independent for doing this.Is the condemnation of propaganda just anti-propaganda propaganda?Btw - if I ever get my head chopped off by crazy ANYONE... dont be scared. Be REALLY, REALLY mad... and drop MORE bombs.What happened?I'm completely taken aback by this. I've never seen a paper be so bold in a statement.Today, my brother died. Not from anything this dramatic. But from an unexpected heart attack. I have no words. Or reason. But I know my big brother would've hated everything to do with bigotry. Racism. And overall revulsion of another race via biggoted views.  

You're all fabulous people, my brother was an artist, poet and writer who wrestled his demons daily... as we all do, we can all see the overall view here I'm sure... be excellent to each other and rase a glass.#EPICFAIL A Loser's Guide to Social Media.

Wow, really poignant. Could have been so much more poignant were it not for the 30% top of page ads.Should have used a helllo kitty background.Are they implying they don't carry propaganda? That's a lot of black ink.Any newspaper that claims it's not printing propaganda is definitely printing propaganda.I feel like ""#EpicFail - A loser's guide to social media"" probably shouldn't be placed directly above this.I think an all black front with no advertisements at the top would have been more effective.

Sea lions have canine teeth, just like a dog. It dragged me headfirst into the water. I’d actually seen it out of the corner of my eye a split second before I felt the pain. It was big and had such strength. It pulled me straight down to the bottom of the bay, about 25-30ft. I was moving incredibly fast through the water. It whipped me back and forth five or six times. I thought, “Well, now you know how you are going to die.”

The water pressure could have blown out my eardrums, but I equalised the pressure by swallowing. When I surfaced I could hear my wife screaming my name. The whole thing lasted no more than 25 seconds. I climbed the ladder on to the boat and lay down. Every breath felt like agony. There was a huge hole in my hand, the blood was gushing out.

I was once employed by DirecTV, which claims exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package. Each year, the top seller of the Sunday Ticket package in each DirecTV call center was given some recognition and award by the NFL. It so happens that a friend of mine (Jason) won for our call center and the prize for that year was to fly out for a weekend trip on location for the filming of an advertisement for Sunday Ticket.  Mr. Manning was being featured in the ad and all of the award recipients and their guests were to do a meet and greet with him during filming. I asked Jason if he would be willing to take a football card and have it signed, to which he agreed.

When Jason returned from the trip, he presented me with the signed card (personalized to me) and told me about his meeting with Mr. Manning. He said there were something like twenty people that had gone on the trip, and that Mr. Manning had apparently requested small bios of all of those who we're coming to the meet and greet. When they arrived, he addressed each of them by name and talked with every one of them personally about their lives and thanked them all for their efforts to help market the NFL, etc. He also joked around with all of them while he was filming the ad and was just generally very personable and great.

Since having learned about the events of that trip, I have always had a high opinion of Mr. Manning, feeling that his treatment of those in attendance was far above what many players would offer in a similar circumstance.

TL;DR - Peyton Manning treats a bunch of fans very well during a meet and greet.I like that he took the time to fill in the ""r"" in ""Mr"" before his signature.When PM was in his final year in Indy during the injury season, some family friends would see him before the game pull into the players lot in his car before the game as they tailgated across from the entrance. (One time he even rolled down his window and jokingly asked for a hotdog.)

During the final home game of the year, after seeing the same die hard group there through every game in that season where the Colts went 2-14, he approached the group before the game unsolicited and thanked them for their support during the long year and posed with some pictures at their tailgate spot.

He will always be my favorite athlete of all time, and even though we are set up better for the future with Andrew Luck, I miss Peyton every time I see him play.I'm pretty sure Ryan Leaf is available.Plot twist: OP's sister's fiancee is Eli Manning.Peyton is all class.What an idiot.

It's ""Bicker's Eiland"" What's up with Amsterdam? There are two posts on my front page about it, which is two more than usual. The sligthly crooked boats on the right side are bothering me.It looks like a high quality remake of an old Sim City game.The quality of this picture is so bad for the resolution. Absolutely love this city. Don't even care about getting lost there, such a beautiful place.This is one of the first pics on /r/pics that I've seend upvoted because it was a good pic and not because of some political point or sappy title. Nice job OP!Loving the Amsterdam love on the frontpage today. Oranje!This picture is posted so much more than usual..This get's posted every.. single..week..Is that a drone shot from Casey Neistat lol? Westerdok, Amsterdam

I took this one and fed her puppy formula every few hours for two days; took her to work with me, kept her in a cooler full of my shirts in the shade.  Day three her eyes looked great and she was active so I did some homework and found a local vet who rehabilitates squirrels and skunks and [shipped her off to rehab](http://i.imgur.com/Xn9KawT.jpg).   I was sad to see her go but I can't be raising no skunk.

Little stinker Looks like a Tribble.Animal control officer here.

Skunks, at least here in my part of Texas, are the number one carrier of rabies. As many as 2/3rds of skunks tested return positive results. It's not likely the baby has it, but it is possible. It's spread through the saliva and mother animals tend to clean their young with their tongues so while unlikely, it CAN be spread without requiring a bite or scratch.

The virus likely wouldn't survive long on the baby's fur but I'd still exercise caution. Wash your hands thoroughly. Don't rub your eyes or pick your nose. This is assuming you made sure you had no open cuts on your hand before handling it.

Baby skunks are kind of case-by-case when it comes to spraying. Some of them won't do it at all while others will lift their tails and spin around like a garden sprinkler. Approached carefully, most skunks won't even spray.

If you notify your local animal control agency, just a heads up, they'll very possibly treat this as an exposure and, for your own safety, euthanize the skunk and submit it to be tested for rabies.

One of the husbands friends buys a bottle of booze of the same year the first baby was born, but cannot drink it. The father has to wait until the kid is old enough to drink or is finally mature.

They are both [puffalumps](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IUPbfxSHL._SX300_.jpg), apparently of the mouse variety. Mine is named Little Rabbit, so it's surprising to learn as an adult that I never noticed the species mismatch.The one on the left now belongs to Mr. Bean.[deleted]That's some forward thinking on the part of your mom. It's an adorable idea.That is awesome.  Before I deployed for the first time, my father gave me a strong manly hug, and reminded me not to be a hero.  My mom quietly gave me a small shopping bag with my bear in it.  She said that she'd feel better if I brought it with me, so I did.  My bear is a shellback, damnit.Nice try Ted 2 marketing team.Congrats! Being an uncle/aunt is a lot of fun. You get to spoil the kid without losing 6 months of sleep. Plus you can give them candy when your sibling says no, and your the cool one (a couple years down that road).

Holy shit my niece is almost 3... Time flies.i'm kinda freaking out bc i have the same goddam bear and got it when i was a kid. i'm 30 yrs old now, any info on the tag or any more descriptors? this is mind blowing for me you just opened up a nostalgic memory forgotten for a couple of decades

[""Negro tenant farmer, rehabilitation client. Jefferson County, Kansas"", 1938.](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1997003700/PP/)


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration):


>Initially created as the Resettlement Administration (RA) in 1935 as part of the New Deal in the United States, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was an effort during the Depression to combat American rural poverty.


>The FSA stressed ""rural rehabilitation"" efforts to improve the lifestyle of sharecroppers, tenants, very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture — that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.
Fallout looking motherfucker.It somebow bring the distant past into the present. Awesome work. Does anyone know a good online repository for such work? Jefferson County, KS has an average annual rainfall of ~38 inches. In 1938, they got 10.5"". I seriously doubt it was this green. It was called the ""dustbowl"" for a reason.  Crooks is looking goodWe don't say ""colorized"" anymore.  You ""African Americanized"" this photo. Outstanding. Best example of this type of work that I have ever seen.Color me impressed. He looks like a black J.k Simmons. Great job on the colourisation! Are you sure he was black I would desaturate the blue sky and green trees, because, you know: The depression. fucking well donethis is one of the best colorizations ive ever seenAnd he's only 19!Looks like a screenshot of a Fallout 4 NPC to me.Nothing to add, I stumbled upon this post on /r/all.

I just want to say that I am impressed by the result. I didn't imagine that colors could add *so much* to a photo.

Cherry blossoms guide your way,

It's snowing on Mount Fuji. http://i.minus.com/iblgBgXYNzj0gs.gifhow come the pictures look so soft?Dumbass coming through. What's with all the ""it's snowing on Mt. Fuji"" comments?I read this as ""Japan in full boom""
I expected something else[Source](https://500px.com/photo/105244145/fuji!-by-daniel-kordan) and /r/japanpics if you want to take a look.For anyone feeling inspired to go to Japan, I've gone twice so let me make it concrete for ya.

**Flights:** Flights can be, at best, around 600 USD round trip. United ran a special for this cost. Often you'll find a round trip for about 1200 USD (this is my experience flying from SFO in the bay area). Use [itasoftware](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) to search for flights. Also google around for deals.

Alternatively, look into acquiring mileage points through credit card usage and flying for free. 

**Room:** On my second visit I stayed in a hostel called [Khaosan Kabuki](http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/en/kabuki/) for about 35 a night. You can get free room if you volunteer to clean. 

Many hostels are similarly priced / have similar volunteer benefits. 

Let me clarify that a ""hostel"" is not as shady as it connotes. The place I stayed was as clean as any hotel I've been to.

Capsule Hotels are also cheap and somewhat of an experience. 

**Food:** Food in Japan is like food anywhere. There's cheap stuff (less than 10) decent stuff (10-25) and expensive (30-100's). 

You can have a very enjoyable trip eating for less than 10 a meal although I suggest splurging once or twice because Japan does have amazing food to offer. The best value / quality for sushi I've heard of and had myself is a place called [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/index.html).

There's no tipping either which is amazing as I'm from the U.S. and any $10 meal was actually $10.

**Sights / Activities:** This is far more flexible depending on the kind of person you are. I spent most of my time walking around which is free.  I recommend at least 1 planned activity that's unique to Japan and new to you (Karaoke, Onsen, traditional breakfast, etc). 

**Language Barrier:** Japanese people are some of the most courteous and kind people in the world. Culture reasons. One of the things that stands out on my first trip was a mob of people *standing on the right side of an escalator and letting walkers through on the left. No one broke this rule.* 

English is pretty prevalent in Japan, especially the cities. In fact there's a Starbucks in the Shibuya Crossing which is a hugely popular spot and a KFC nearby. Western influence abounds.

People are mostly happy to try and communicate with you. But yes, it's scary to engage with someone who doesn't speak your language. 

**Story Time:** I was with my friend Matt (who had actually just finished traveling east from Florida... long way around the world). We had a ""sushi day"" where we decided to get expensive sushi lunch and dinner in the same day.

For lunch, we visited [Kyubei](http://www.kyubey.jp/). Our reservation was made by our Hostel staff (which is something they are always willing to help with). I'm assuming they acknowledged we were English speaking and we were sat with a chef who spoke enough English. 

For dinner, we visited the [highest-rated sushi place on Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066854-d1692134-Reviews-Sushiryori_Inose-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html). After an awesome sushi course, we were sitting alone in their shop. It was cold outside. The sushi chef spoke ""O-sake?"" offering us some sake. 

Well, we ended up sitting with them for almost two more hours drinking sake and bumbling our way through communication. I learned their son is a model in magazines. They pulled out a giant map of the world and my friend Matt showed them where he had been. They like California Cabernet wine. The wife played some Michael Jackson on her phone and did an impersonation. 

Points here are that people want to connect with you and Japan is pretty accepting of English.

We even had a bus driver yelling at us on a bus full of Japanese passengers. Turns out we missed our stop (I had mentioned it to him before getting on). He literally stopped the bus, motioned for us to get out, and pointed us in the right direction. It was embarrassing and stressful unlike the previous sushi dinners. Point here is that there will be moments where it's not roses.

---

All in all you could do Japan on 2k easily. If you pull a flight deal or a free flight through miles it'll be even cheaper.Ok, I will be that guy.

WTF is going on with the ladder. 

It looks like somebody was fixing the roof and just said. ""Fuck it, I will just leave this here.""Where was this taken?  gTA needs a game set in Japan.I miss japan.
