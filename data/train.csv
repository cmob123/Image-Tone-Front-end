He owns several hundred and has them displayed all across Playtone (his production office). They are all in pristine condition and don't look like they've aged a day. 

His entire production office is loaded up with fantastic memorabilia. Lots of pop culture and incredible pieces from the forties, fifties, and sixties. The man's loaded with taste and class.

And as you may well know he happens to be one of the nicest, kindest, most genuine guys in the business.

    Dear Chris, Ashley, and all the diabolical genuies at Nerdist Industries.

    Just who do you think you are to try to briibe me into an appearance on your
    'thing' with this gift of the most fantastic Cornona Silent typewriter made in 1934?

    You are out of your minds if you think... that I... wow, this thing has great action...
    and this deep crimson color... Wait! I'm not so shallow as to... and it types nearly
    silently...

    Oh, OKAY!

    I will have my people contact yours ad work out some kind of interview process...

    Damn you all to hell,

Tom HanksLink to the podcast:

http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/nerdist-podcast-tom-hanks/Tom's episode of the podcast was one of the best in recent memory. Nothing will top the Henry Rollins episode, though. That shit was a revelation.Not sure if this was it, but in case I'm not the only one curious about what the [typewriter](https://www.smithcorona.com/blog/smith-corona-virtual-typewriter-museum/post-merger-office-machines-interwar-period/) looked like.Awesome post, but just curious... how in the hell does this have over 10,000 *net* upvotes??? The most I've ever seen is like, maybe 3000 or 4000, and generally the top posts on the front page have about 2000, right? Isn't there some sort of algorithm that balances out ridiculous amounts of upvotes with downvotes or something?That is classy sir. Straight up Classy.Im not even going to whore my username for karma, I just want to say Tom Hanks is the greatest American Actor to ever live.
We should print his face on money.Looks like your invitation was just his type.I call Shenanigans: That signature clearly says ""Tom Hanly"".

I read the entire thing in his voice.And what a podcast it was. Good job Nerdist. My goal of hearing Tom Hanks tell funny stories was realized and made last night a pretty good one.

We got on the train, and all fell asleep pretty quickly. I was first to wake up and I was quick to notice that although we were still moving, it was very slow and dark. I looked out the window and down the train, and to my amazement the fucking train was being put into a big cruise ship. I quickly nudged my buddies awake, and as any engineering major would do, they all instantly sprung an infrastructure boner. We were flabbergasted. Our train is going into a boat this is insane. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any cooler, they let everyone out of the train to walk around the ship, grab a bite to eat, have a cigarette and stretch your legs. The best part though, was hitting the duty free shop and getting a bunch of booze for the rest of the trip. I don't know if that's a normal mode of transportation in Europe or even in the U.S. but it was the first time I had seen it and I was blown away.In addition to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel already described, the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel also has the same configuration.  Here's a picture of it [EDIT: actually, with thanks to /u/chasetwisters for the clarification, a picture of its next-door neighbor bridge-tunnel the MMBT, see below for the real image].

""Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridge–tunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels.""

So, if you like these, and you live in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area, you have your choice of two [EDIT: or, really, three] bridge-tunnels.

I caused the death of spider today and I've not been able to shake the whole ordeal from my head.

You see, I was driving in my car and I see something in my peripheral vision. It's a huge golden orb-weaver. A BANANA SPIDER! He's on my window, the inside, and he's looking at me and I'm looking at him and the cop behind me is looking at both of us and wondering why I'm not driving because the light is now green.

I rolled down my window but that didn't do any good. Spider just hopped down to my arm rest. Too close for comfort. I open my door a little bit but Spider can't take a hint.

WHOOP WHOOOOOOP. The cop is now pulling us over. I turn into a near by parking lot, spider clumsily bolts out of my car via the rolled down window, officer approaches my vehicle and says ""What're you doing, son?!"", I hear a crunch.

The Caiyuanba Bridge is an arch bridge which crosses the Yangtze River in Chongqing, China. Completed in 2007, the arch spans 420 metres (1,380 ft) ranking among the longest arch bridges in the world. The bridges carries 6 lanes of traffic and two track of Chongqing Rail Transit Line 3 between the Nan'an District south of the Yangtze River and the Yuzhong District to the north.

What do all the buttons and levers do? Couple years ago when my son was a toddler he was obsessed with garbage trucks, absolutely in love with them.  Every Friday morning we would sit on the balcony of our 3rd story apartment and watch the big ole WM truck come empty out the dumpsters and my son was just captivated, no matter how many times he had seen them before.

Now my parents lived in a little town about 35 minutes away, and we would visit them at least once a week.  My folks are oddly generous and every week when the garbage men come through their neighborhood my mom will go out there and give them all cold bottles of water, gatorade or soda.  Its just a little thing that has endeared my parents to the garbage men.  

Well just so happens that my sons 3rd bday fell on whatever day of the week was garbage day in my folks neighborhood.  While we were at their house the garbage truck comes rumbling along.  I ran out there as my mom was getting them their drinks and explained that my son just loved the shit out of garbage trucks and offered them $20 to let us have a little ride around the neighborhood.  

The driver refused the money but took us around the neighborhood anyway.  I gave the money to his partner and told him to go have a few rounds on me after work.   For the next year everytime they saw my son and I they would give us a ride, all in all we had 3 ride alongs.   

There's not really a point to this story, other than OPs pic brought back one of my favorite memories of all time.  My son was so god damn excited, but also felt pretty special, which of course made my week.I see ""JAG OFF"" stickers...Pittsburgh? Do you like your job? I've been thinking about being a garbage man. What cool stuff have you found?i'm not sure if you're aware of this...but both of my children LIVED for garbage day when they were small.  they would loose it when they heard the truck and we would run out (no matter what state we were in) to stand on the porch and watch.  we would always say hello and chat briefly with the guys.  (never a lady on my route).  so i'm not sure if you know, but you are ACTUAL heros to many kids out there.  they love you.  what's in the bag?This guy has GOT TO BE from Pittsburgh. The ""jag off"" is strong in this truck...

That and ""the shocker""...So instead of giving my trash men beer for the holidays, I should just give them cool stickers for the inside of the truck? I can do that.""Stay Drunk."" Probably not the best sticker to have in your truck. How comfortable is it sitting in there?
lots of people like to think their jobs are important but aren't.  If I didn't go to work for a week who would care?  realistically....no one.  If a garbage man didn't go to work for a week....FUCKING CHAOS.[removed]what country? i used to work as a garbagetruckman in sweden and ours were a whole lot more modern than that, also ended up making them personalized, not so much with stickers but with other things.

remember hooking up a stereo-speaker system to the rear and connecting it to the musicplayer so we didnt miss the song/the radio speaker when getting off to work.

you make surprisingly much as a garbageman in sweden too. i made roughly twice the national average a month from the garbageman job and i finished so early i could have a second part-time job after. worked between 6-10 (rouhly, we got off work when finished with our route, also sometimes had slightly earlier hours) and then had a second work starting at 1pm.

ironically you end up making almost three times swedens national average as a garbageman that way, which is fun because everyone treats you as if you're below them somehow, if only they knew.

also, note to americans, we make very little money in sweden (made up for by a lot of things being ""free"" etc) so the national average monthly salary is ""just"" 2500 a month, however this is enough to have a lower middleclass lifestyle, so it is comparable with ""a lot"" more by US standard of salary.

however, if you have a high paying job in sweden (4000 usd +) you would be better off as an american, as the swedish system is less rewarding when you succeed but gives you more room to succeed.

anyway, just my story.

tl;dr

I wish I could see the signature, as I likely know the doctor in question!

My own GP hates requests for sick notes. I once called in sick a single time in a six month period, and was asked for a note. Spitefully, my GP wrote me off for three weeks in a glorious August, filling in the ""reason for absence"" section as ""None of your goddamn business. Confidentiality trumps bullshit policy."" That was the last time I was asked for a sick note.
 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! If you ever need health care in Halifax I'll be sure you get a real saline drip, not the bagged harbour water were usually use!Yep I just show up sick, do a really half-assed job, spread the illness around then go home. The American way.This is the perfect way to deal with that kind of policy.

Calm and understanding tone to maintain rapport. Expose the extra work and problems it causes. Mirror the absurdity by requiring an equally useless piece of work from them. Invoice them for the unnecessary cost. Appeal to the sense of community they (probably unknowingly) betray by outsourcing the cost of their organizational distrust for employees to other businesses.

Great lesson in diplomacy, right here.I do find it kind of silly that companies require a Doctors note if you are sick.

My company does this and I always cringe when I have to tell the employee that policy requires a doctors note if they call in sick more than a day or two.
If someone has the flu, stay the hell home. I don't care, we'll figure shit out.
Sure if you tell me you have a physical injury, I need a note and instructions from your doctor on what you can do when you get back for those who have positions that require physical labour, but if you just had the flu? Stay the hell home, I don't really care.
In the end most of them are paid hourly, if it isn't busy season...you are saving me money.
It's more of a deterrent for people who BS sick days, but it doesn't really work there either. Since they'll find a doctor to fill that stuff out regardless, so you're just wasting everyones time.

My dad used to work in an ER in Nova Scotia. He said it was completely fucked. So many people with very minor issues clogging everything up.Years ago I was a server and the flu hit me while I was working Handling food, drinks, silverware... GM sent me home seeing for himself I was really sick and said don't come in tomorrow. I was supposed to work the following 3 days. I did not show up the next day but by the third I was feeling better and came in. 

The MOD asked for my doctors note. I did not go to the doc nor could I afford the $150 to go to the walk-in clinic. She fired me on the spot leaving the floor short a server. 

The GM called 4 days later asking me WTF? I explained everything to him and he fired the MOD. 

EDIT: GM did not call me 4 days later but 4 days after the initial ""go home you're sick"". 1 day after the firing.Good on that doctor. Fantastic. I remember waiting with my wife in a walk-in clinic for four hours so she could be seen for 2 minutes so she could buy a note from the doctor's office for a flu. Biggest waste of time ever, but her company required itI got written up at an old job for refusing to give them a note. It was worth it to me- I'm not going to the doctor for a migraine, there's nothing they can do, it's just going to cost me more money on top of the money I'm losing by being unable to work.Whats even stranger is friends and family telling me to see a doctor. Its a fucking cold!That's the most Canadian ""fuck you"" I've ever seen. Bravo. Sick notes are for teenagers in high school, not middle aged employees. And they're nonsense anyway. I know what a 24hr stomach virus looks like. I know I don't need a doctor for it. Why the heck should I drag myself to a doctor's office unnecessarily just to appease my company's paranoia.I work in a hospital, and the policy here is essentially ""come in sick or it counts against you"".  Obviously, they don't say that, and they don't want us to work while sick, but they still ding you for calling out (even with a doctor's note).

So, we work around sick patients, which means we're likely to get sick, and we're less likely to call out, so we're likely to make our co-workers sick.  The whole thing is stupid.Instead of asking medical note because of abuse of sick leave benefit, why don't companies hire people they trust? 

If you trust your employees so little that you need to treat them like liars when they call in sick then you need to reconsider your hiring practices.Good for that doctor. I despise the sick note policies that so many companies have.  

I was once so sick with the flu that I genuinely couldn't get out of bed to go see my doctor to get a note, so I went back a couple of days later when I was feeling better to ask her for the note my manager required. I obviously wasn't sick anymore, so she just asked me what dates I was sick and wrote the note accordingly.  

So clearly it doesn't matter if I'm actually sick or not, as long as my doctor will vouch for me. But I have to be a drain on the healthcare system either way. I worked for a retail art supply store, and they brought in a new manager who decided to implement a similar policy of requiring a note if you called in sick.  I told him it cost money and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket for something like that, especially because I had already lost a days wages (no sick days), and was only making $8.50/hour.  He said that I wouldn't be re-imbursed, so I said ""no"".  Nothing more was said. I like the doctors note though, anything which put the responsiblity for such a paternalistic, and wasteful policy back on the employer. 

Its ironic isn't it, an employer generally wants a note to make sure the employee isn't being irresponsible and playing hooky; but the reality is that the request itself is far more irresponsible in its actual effect when you consider the extra strain it puts on the health care system.  

TL; DR= The dr. nailed it.I'm sorry, but screw demanding doctors' notes unless it's an extended illness.

""Oh, you're feeling sick today? NOW YOU MUST GO OUT OF YOUR HOME INSTEAD OF RESTING UP AND PAY A $50 COPAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING SICK.""

How about, if you don't trust your employees enough to believe them when they call in, you're a moron for employing them?I was home due to chicken pox this week and last week.

I work in IT, specifically as a senior DBA. I told them I would be out for 2 weeks but would be fully capable of working from home.

The following happened:

 - Boss required me to bring in a doctor's note with the diagnosis and expected return date.
 - Did not give me permission to work from home (yet made the expectation of such clear)
 - Made it quite clear that, in no uncertain terms, if I didn't have a note, I'd be dismissed for work abandonment.

I informed said boss that so long as I was chewing up sick time, I would not, for any reason what-so-ever, log into the VPN. At no point would I answer any pages nor emergency alerts. I informed him he was welcome to talk to HR / Legal about my stance and who was in the right.

This is the week that the cluster decided to have problems.

I can't wait to tell him that in another week I'm going to be out again for a gall bladder removal.

Like a dimestore hooker without any customers.If my job search is any indication this letter will never get read by any human person and the Dr. will get an automated reply saying ""thank you for applying but the position has already been filled.""Yeah that's bullshit. You're not a fucking child. Funniest part about sick notes is 99% of the time I'm sick because of the poor sanitation policies around your nasty work place.Problem is call centres dont give a fuck. Its an awful place to work the company knows it is so they do this to prevent people from taking stress days and such because not having every possible person on the phones hurts their business. Every call centre says that they are better than the rest but all of them eventually treat you like numbers and not like human beings.The best part here in the states is requiring a note when your company doesnt offer health insurance.

Basically a strongly emitting source of radiation is kept in a chamber with tubes leading through the chamber. Vials of samples get pushed into the chamber with an air shuttle kind of arrangement so they can get irradiated for analysis.

While the core of the reactor is housed in a heavy lead vessel, the rest of the reactor is made of cement with iron slugs used as aggregate instead of gravel. The iron chunks don't stop gamma emission as well as lead, but they do a better job than gravel.

One day, several trucks of cement were scheduled to begin casting of the walls of the core. The prof strenuously advised the construction foreman to only fill the trucks 1/3 full because the iron slugs would be considerably more dense than the aggregate they usually use. The foreman ignored the warnings, chalking them up as being the prattlings of an old naggy man and didn't give any orders to short fill the trucks. 

The trucks departed the cement plant charged with cement and iron aggregate and suffered eventual failure of all of their tires on the highway. They got stuck there loaded up with their massive overburdens of iron aggregate cement until their drum motors and bearings failed and the cement set inside the drums. They had to cut the drums apart off of the trucks  with plasma torches and jackhammers to clear up the heavy mess.Got any more details on location?

It's the planted flag that really makes it.Plot twist: it is an abandoned NASA capsule, and the cement truck is a cover story.it's been there since the 50's but the edge of the road still looks like the wreck happened last week?  Cement and concrete are not the same thing. That is a concrete truck. Think of it like a cookie; cement is flour, rock is chocolate chips and water is water. Would you call cookie dough flour! WOULD YOU!A new pod has been found! We must claim it before the imperials do!I heard the cement truck collided with a prison bus. Twelve hardened criminals escaped.>too heavy to move

that's... not a thing. 

not since archemedius de grassroots einstein first yelled eureka.Why was it too heavy to move? It was literally on something that moved it down the road.Not even close to being too heavy to move. They just didn't want to deal with a crane.

[These could lift the fuck out of that thing](http://fieldlens.com/blog/building-better/biggest-cranes/)On Florida's I-4 highway,  near Lakeland there is a flight museum called Fantasy of Flight. They use advertise it with a plane near the road positioned nose down, like it had crashed. They had to change it to just a regular landed position because the authorities were getting so many calls about a crashed plane next to the highway.I know a guy and his walrus that can make that disappear.[Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.5827153,-95.6513742,3a,37.5y,277.44h,83.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCPf3cp9iiLdrW6R7vfa4dw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en)

edit: Ok I got it. Look at the orange thing in the center of the white ""loop"", thats the Mallards mouth + nostrils facing TOWARDS you. then the little spaces in the bottom are its feet

The swan is facing left, the mallard is facing towards the camera basically.I'm going to disagree with the majority here. It's a wonderful concept but the execution is a little unrefined. The type face of the logo and the restaurant are not the same so it feels disconnected. I think if the designer had instead focused on drawing the animals to create the ampersand, rather than squeezing them in to the sans serif ampersand, it would have better reflected the elegance of the type face in *The Swan & Mallard*.  There's greater potential here.

He proceeded to seriously bank the plane (felt like 30-35 degrees!) to give everyone a good view since we were flying more close to directly over the top.

That's the most I've ever felt a commercial flight banked to one side.  My face was smashed against the window and people were holding on to the armrests to not smash the people next to them.

I thought it was beautiful that someone that flies 100+ hours a month and has probably seen 100% of the country from 30,000+ feet countless times still acknowledges the beauty and shared it with everyone.  I wish I had been able to thank him after the flight.Awesome!  Right place, right time!  How did you keep the picture so crisp through glass?

This modified version is designed and made by Hal Taylor (@HalTaylor_Rocks on IG).  
If you visit Hal's web page, this chair actually holds a very special and highly hypocritical back story.  You see, one of Hal's former apprentices once asked if he could use this design to make for himself, to which Hal said ""fuck no"".  The apprentice made one anyway and Hal was all ""argggghhhhh"".  Then Hal went on making reproduction Sam Maloof chairs for a living, just as he had before.
Edit:  Hal's web address.  http://www.haltaylor.com The store I'm referring to is at the bottom of the home page.

Best work distraction since Reddit...Amazing job. Finally a good post. Quality and genius. Such cool birds. They're so fast and mechanical in their movements, like little flying robots. PROTIP: Throw a pack of red bee balm seeds in a corner of your yard by your windows. They absolutely go apeshit for red bee balm. We've been enjoying them for the last 3 summers in a row, as bee balm is a perennial.

Zero maintenance.Very cool pic. I love the stitched time lapse type of photos.

However, I am now irrationally afraid of being ventilated by tiny bug-birds.Hummingbirds mostly look at our feeder and then fly away. I realized tonight it's at least partly because we look intently at them whenever they come by. What can we do for more hummingbird action?!That's a beautiful image.
It reminds me of the work of Mike Kelley.

This was taken in Etosha National Park, Namibia [edit: detailed location removed, see comments below]. I waited at a waterhole for 7 hours from noon to 7pm. There was very little wildlife activity during the afteroon, and only a few springboks showed up to drink. At around 6pm the sky was still overcast and I almost decided to leave, but eventually decided to stay until the end of the day. The real show started around 6:30pm as the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.

I went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.

I travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience. Go if you ever get the chance!

Finally I have a [photography website](http://www.johangeorget.com) for those who wish to see pictures of this trip. I hope no one will mind me that I share the links here.

Just look at this list of sports they have in paralympics:

* wheelchair basketball
* wheelchair tennis
* wheelchair rugby
* 100m running, for amputees
* swimming
* etc.

Now the other fucking post i was reading with the 2 army tanks makes a HELL of a lot more sense now.
I've been thinking about it for the past 20 minutes and couldn't understand why i was so fucking confused =sIf the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay was what it historically was, it would filter the entire bay's volume of water in 3 days. The oyster population is so low now that it takes over a year. Can the oysters also predict the World Series winner?Oysters are great. I organize an effort in my town to create oyster mats. These mats are chained together in specific areas of the river and foster new oyster beds by giving the larvae a place to attach to. If we get enough growth, it may have a positive effect on our river's water quality. Each oyster can filter 50 gallons a day of water and they are a keystone species of many ecosystems.This isn't as clear-cut of a comparison as the image wants you to believe. The water being clear isn't an indication of ecological health any more than being murky is. Murky could be pollutants, but it could also be algae. Algae are necessary to the ecosystem. The water on the right appears stripped of algae because the oysters eat it. That's good up to a point, and then it starts being a problem.

If I showed you this exact same image using lake water and zebar mussels, it would be a demonstration of the ecological damage done by invasive zebra mussels.That's where the flavour comes from.Question: Can I get oysters and put them in a fish tank with my fish and never have to clean the water again?

I hope one day I visit a place where I can see/touch the snow for the first time ever. When I was in college, there was a guy from Africa (I want to say Zimbabwe or Zaire but I can't remember). Turns out, he's never seen snow or experienced cold weather. He told me he had a jacket and showed me a paper thin Members Only jacket. I explained to him about the dangers of frostbite and the importance of thick socks, boots, gloves, hats,  and having a real coat.

I even drove him to Goodwill where he found the right clothes for a tough Ohio winter. For the next few months, he would smile and thank me for teaching him about how to stay warm with the right clothes. 

Edit: grammarI went to college with this girl who was Swedish, but grew up in Miami. Swedish family, spoke Swedish at home, etc. But in South Florida. She made regular trips to Sweden every summer to visit family there.

But never in the winter. One year she flies to Sweden in December and it's snowing. She reacts to snow the way most people in south Florida do--joy, utter amazement, running around trying to catch flakes on your tongue, etc.

So there's this scene of this full-blooded Swedish girl, speaking Swedish, in Sweden, seeing snow for the first time at 16 years of age. That must've been some kind of weird to see.Guy second from the back: ""this shit is cold!""I was in high school in NJ when we got a student from Jamaica. Because of different grade levels there, he was actually a year or two younger than the rest of us. We became friends. One day he asked me about the leaves changing colors and I explained how they would do that and then they would all fall off. He then asked a very anxious follow-up question:

""Will they come back?"" :-)

I reassured him they would. It began to snow on the first day of a freshman undergrad class I was in. A classmate from India with a thick accent shyly admitted he had never seen snow, so our professor encouraged our small class to run outside so Mohit could experience snowfall. I'll never forget his big smile, total sense of wonder, and his first comment when we got outside: ""Oh my goodness! It is like God has really bad dandruff!"" You haven't seen snow until you've seen it in giant piles in shopping mall parking lots; the snow dyed grey by the car exhaust. It is like a two wheeled Cool Runnings.

There's more to Rwanda than genocide.My boss is from india and this is his first time seeing snow. the day after about 5 inches of snow, when there were just flurries he was worried about driving home. After assuring him it wouldnt affect his drive home, he asked me what happened when it melted.i was confused. 

i said ""what?  what do you mean?""

""when it all melts what happen?  do they have to close the roads cuz they are all flooded?""  

It blew my mind that he didnt know what happened when snow melted.  I just figured everyone knew that it all just goes away.

That's how i would react if I ever see snow. (I'm from California)My aunt is married to a man who had children with two other women before he met her. His first wife lived near them in New Jersey, but the second was in Arizona. When their son was a teen, he moved from Arizona to NJ to spend some time with his dad and get the benefit of the better school system. They had his mom up for holidays, and while she was visiting for christmas it snowed heavily... and she'd never seen snow before, she'd lived her whole life in Arizona. My aunt bundled her up in some winter wear and took her for a walk.

She knew it fell from the sky. She knew it was cold. She'd had a sno-cone before, so she kinda understood the texture. What she hadn't imagined was how *quiet* the world becomes when it snows, how the snow absorbs all sound and there's a beautiful silence. 

Having lived in the northeast all my life I'm sick of snow in most ways, but I still enjoy that silence in the middle of a snowstorm.Moved to Philadephia. That was the first time I ever saw snow. When the ""flurries"" started I thought it was volcanic ash, panicked, and ran inside a bank. Then I saw no one else was running. Then I thought someone was shredding plastic bags and thought it was highly rude, and harmful to the environment. Then I took a bus back home. When I realized that this plastic bag shredding extended all the way to my house, I started doubting myself.

I bet the photographer got a ton of points from Professor Oak for that pic.My mom is obsessed with this animal. It's her profile picture on every social media platform. She makes me call her Pika sometimes and calls me Pika as well. It's confusing.

Edit: [yup](http://i.imgur.com/Hqi7vcb.jpg)I just read about this thing. It's more endangered than the panda. The Chinese call it a Magic Rabbit.>Native to the Xinjiang region of China, there are only 1,000 of these tiny, cute creatures, known as the Ili pika, left.

>Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat further up the mountain peaks.The name of it comes from the name of area where it's found, Ili Prefecture (which is actually a shortened version). 

There's so little information because of how elusive it is so we can't currently determine causes of its endangerment. The area is somewhat mountainous as you can see in the picture, perhaps they just fall off and die or some shit.Pika Pika.Imagine how lucky one of those feet would be...

1000 years from now there's going to be abandoned shopping centers that are federally protected and people trying to restore them to their original condition.I'd love to see this done using augmented reality, where my cell phone is like a window into the past.I just got back from Rome last week - Our tour guide for the Colosseum/Forum had a book full of things like this.

One of the few souvenirs I bought on the trip.Oh man, Detroit could totally use this technology! Wikipedia has some interesting images of how it looked like in the past:

[Here is an image of what it looked like in 1840](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Heidentor_%28Stich%29.jpg) and here is an [image made in 1655](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Heidentor_c_beuttler.jpg).

It is amazing to realize that the latter picture, that is over a century older than the USA, was made when the monument was already a ruin over a millennium old.wooops!  Looks like the builders colored outside of the lines.They would be funny if they drew in some drunk Roman guy passed out against the wall of the building Wait, is that... is that ""Real Life augmented Reality""? That is a great idea!In one of M.J.Fox's movie, when he was about to build an own hotel, he used the same idea. I always wondered why this isn't more frequently in open areasGreat idea, want to see more of this in Rome. So, how do they know what it originally looked like?  It's been in ruins for a thousand years and not like they had pictures to go offA little more info on the display:

This display at Carnuntum is the only one of its kind on this site. It is even meant as a temporary display since sooner or later the Heidentor (heathen's gate) is supposed to be rebuilt following original Roman building style.

They have a very nice museum at the excavation site nearby where they already have a few fully functional Roman buildings that were rebuilt in the original style and with original materials.

Carnuntum is a fascinating excavation site with a very cleverly built museum which constantly improves.

During summer they have some festivities there and at their sister site ""Bad Deutsch Altenburg"". They show Gladiator fights, Roman army training, Roman lifestyle in general.

The site is about half an hour drive from Vienna and definitely worth a visit. Entry fees are moderate and the ticket is valid for the three main sites: Museum Carnuntum, Museum Bad Deutsch Altenburg, and the ""Amphitheater"" Bad Deutsch Altenburg.What if ruins have always been in the state they are now? Like they were built as a way to engage a ruse on the future generations.It kinda irks me that it isn't exactly lined upFor anyone wondering, the word ""Augenhöhe"" on the ride side means eye height, so you get a feeling for how big the ruin wasHow they looked.  What they looked like.This is a very informative view.

Cal. Dept. of Water Resources is letting out so much water from the lake in order to keep salinity levels of the delta in check. When they dropped the flow down too far, salt water from the San Francisco Bay started to creep in. There are multiple reasons for this, one being environmental (the Delta Smelt...) and irrigation purposes. Although it's part of it, California, or rather, Folsom and Sacramento, are NOT drinking this lake dry.

Guess I won't be going back to Sacramento anytime soonThe kids can still play on the beach, just without the splashing around in water part...Looks like New VegasI'd be metal detecting the hell out of that place""No lifeguard on duty...*forever*""It's worth pointing out that people only used to swim there because some people dug a reservoir and dammed a river. It's not a natural lake. California has been living on borrowed water for a long time. No one should be surprised when the bill comes due.Drought is part of the natural water cycle in California. Yes, people expanded to where they shouldn't have, without better backup systems in place. Yes, we are have a particularly bad drought right now.

I don't exactly know how this cultural attitude changed, but people scoff at big projects these days. Covering the CA aquaduct with solar panels, for instance. Or William Shatner's proposed super-long pipeline. Folks should also look up NAWAPA, a plan in the 50's to do man-made water distribution throughout the western US. Hell, even William Shatner proposed a super-long pipeline of a similar nature.

Astonishingly, the notion of long pipelines immediately invokes visions of science fiction in people's minds. Then when you point out that the petrochem industry makes *colossal* pipelines all the time, that is somehow considered irrelevant.

I will immediately betray what I said above, though: this isn't a usual cycle, and we are seeing something change. The Salton Sea was left to die, and it is have a ripple effect in the ecosystem all along the coast. The desertification of the LA region was essentially halted with the creation of the Salton Sea 100 years ago. The existence of the sea sustained weather systems that made the LA region much more livable. Now that the sea is essentially gone, the greater LA area is undergoing a drastic desertification, with soaring temperatures and exposure.

The sea could be saved, too, but again, people scoff at it. A 90 mile seawater pipeline could be built from the Gulf of California to refill the Salton Sea. Cost estimates are somewhere in the $500m-1b range. Scoffing ensues, but you can look at school districts that issues bonds in the hundreds-of-millions range that are just absorbed into people's pockets. If you listen to Eisenhower and compare to military spending, $1b is a small investment compare to military build-up.

... and seawater is actually less salty than the Sea is now! The Sea is 200 feet below sea level, and the pipeline could be passive, if designed correctly. There is a huge dry lake bed in Mexico that could be refilled to an artificial sea, too, if the pipeline was properly built. A little tricky, since it is 80 feet above seal level, but by coupling it to to the -200ft Salton Sea siphon could also make this a passive benefit.

Even if pumping was added, solar or thermal collectors could be added along the length of the pipe, thus making it zero net energy. The economic benefit alone to both countries would likely offset the cost within a decade. The biggest problem would be dealing with Mexico, now that they are a essentially a failed nation.Kids these days have no imagination.

It was basically an arctic rainforest because everything was so wet and overgrown with vegetation. There was fresh water everywhere, I did not have to worry about my water supply.

Crane must have bounced right offCrane operator here!

After a bit of sleuth work I've found the load charts for the crane in the accident. From the information I've found the crane is a Leibherr LR1300 with 555' of boom. 
https://www.coastcrane.com/docs/default-source/lr1300/lr1300---2316-luffing-jib-capacity-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=2
Looking over the manual, with the configuration this crane was running, it was a limit of 15 mph winds. Reports are there were easily 30mph gusts(probably more between this buildings). 
This is all based on speculation and none of it is a fact, just felt like looking into it. Glad it wasn't worse than what it was!

I lived in NYC for a long time, and this is one of those things that I just never think about.  So many buildings are always under construction, and so many cranes are just sitting above you.

It's terrifying to think about.

[His Interview with Dan Perez - Vimeo - 5 Minutes](https://vimeo.com/76218172)I am in front of a computer screen.Took me a second to realize there is in fact a bridge above their heads. You are under a bridge.

\>Look

Somebody has painted an abstract mural on it. Two trolls are minding their own business at the north end.

\>Go north. 

The trolls have taken notice of you and draw their weapons. It took me a while to focus my eyes and see the bridge.No Man's BridgeReal Life Monument Valley.I don't ever wanna feel *~~how~~ like* I did that day.

I was in high school, and the rest of my family was away at some farming convention for the weekend. I was out on the back porch and placed a tab under my tongue. Based on everything I had read and heard, I had done some meditation and relaxation exercises to try and reach as calm and steady a state as possible. I kind of wanted a spiritual sort of experience.

About 45 minutes after I took it, I really started to focus on my breathing. I could feel my skin merging with the air, and everything felt very solid, and whole. Until, that is, I opened my eyes. At that point, the clouds seemed to part, and the sky split open. The sun became a giant pixelated Mario head, and tried to eat me. I ran back inside, but was lucid enough to realize I wasn't okay. I didn't want to risk making a mess of my parents house, so I went back outside and ran straight for the neighbor's house.

They were growing a bunch of egg plants out back. For some reason, I thought the egg plants looked kind of like old-timey bombs, and I felt like I had to disarm them. Of course, this meant picking them all. Their fuses were still burning though, so I did the only thing I could think of: I pissed all over them. It put out the fuses, but the neighbor's wife came running out and beat the shit out of me with a dirty pair of trousers.So, I actually *was* under this bridge a while ago, and for people wondering, it still looks fantastic. People have respected the murals around the city that this artist has done and it really brightens up my day whenever I see one.

>The landing caused the plane to sustain major damage,[7] and it was written off shortly after the incident.[8] A passenger on board the plane said that the aircraft broke into three parts after landing.[9] Later reports said that both the cockpit and vertical stabilizer had separated from the aircraft, and that the wings and undercarriage had both been damaged.[3]

Edit: Just to clarify,

""Pumped to get"" entails being 12 and having one thrown at me out the window of a car by the kid who's mom owned a local toy store. He had boxes full and to be one of the people to catch one was indescribable. It felt like I just got tossed a chunk of gold. I'm just trying to figure out which one's gonna get $14.56 and which one's gonna get the $14.57.This is a really beautiful photograph. It's so raw. These adults seem to have forgotten they are in a courtroom picking their pieces of their broken marriage. 

They look just like children, but all grown up. The gentleman challenged his ex-wife's custodial rights to their Tomagatchi when he found no less than 4 poops on the screen during his court-supervised visit.It would be hilarious if in a few decades Beanie Babies started auctioning for hundreds of dollars each simply because so many people threw away their ""worthless collectibles"". And everyone(me included) that made fun of them were mad because they didn't buy them when they could.Just wait till they get to the pokemon cardsNever thought I'd open reddit to see my aunt and uncle on the front page. It is just as embarrassing now as it was then. Buying Beanie Babies on eBay was the most 1999 thing you could possibly doFor the curious, [here's](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/beanie_babies_bubble_economics_and_psychology_of_a_plush_toy_investment.html) the article I found the picture in.Both must cringe at the sight of this now. Man, I know too much about Beanie babies, and it sticks in my head like a steal trap. A few years ago, a girl said to me, ""my birthday is on November 6, and I said to her, you share a birthday with Pouch the Kangaroo."" So, for anyone who doubts what I'm about to say, I think I have the ruinous resume for this.

This collection of Beanies is hilariously terrible. Almost none of these were ever of any value. I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, so it's clear that these two were collecting to strike it rich. They weren't collecting just to have them. I see a lot of Legs the frogs. They had a little bit of value at one point, and when Chocolate the moose retired (which you can see a couple of, it jumped in value a little as well. But they were not big money makers. It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow. Rainbow and Iggy were released with their tags switched and body parts all messed about. There were a couple releases of each before Ty got it right. That said, it's pretty clear that she knows what she's doing, and he might be a moron. In her pile in th elower left hand corner, she has a Flip the cat, and (I think though it's hard to say for sure) a Dotty the Dalmation. Those two were pretty valuable after they were retired. Probably the most valuable in this collection presuming that the Lucky the Ladybug sitting in the middle of the pile is a later generation version of the Beanie. Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time. If it's a Doodle, I'm guessing at the time, I'd grab that. If it's a Strut, I'd go for the Crunch the Shark. In the end, Crunch would have been better, but Doodle was what everyone was speculating on.Not even Beanie Baby collectors can stand to be around Beanie Baby collectors.Apparently putting your hand to your face and sticking your finger on your mouth was quite the fad in 1999.I don't even care.  I'll say it.  As a kid who loved stuffed animals, these things were the shit.  There was one for just about any animal you could want.  Played with these things every day till I grew out of them.  Think they're still in a box in a closet somewhere around here.Can you imagine the Judge going home after this?

So I am currently a student at said school and I'm not gonna say which one cause well I'm not a noodle head (hah good one) but as far as I know the story goes that this kid is one of the athletic coaches sons (not sure which sport, there are lots at my school) and one day during his dad's practice he decided to get instant noodles from our concessions stand that's open every day after school, kid gets the noodles puts some water in the cup and thinks ""30 secs for this bitch would be dope as fuck."" Kid pops open the microwave puts 30 seconds on the microwave and goes back to watching his dad coach. The only problem was that he put them on for 30 mins instead of seconds, forgets about them and comes back 28 mins and 50 secs later to find that his noodles became disappointmentles. He became somewhat of a living legend at our school and everyone loves and adores him. He even gave himself a nick name ""noodle-boy"" a ton of people call him that and he's kinda embraced the whole thing. Cool kid.

There were some pretty decent storms around last night, I was further east than that so they weakened a bit by the time they reached me.Why do you get all the karma, while I was fucking [on it](http://imgur.com/m10FqZc,B5g3ybz,82OzyDd)This us a good reason why flights are delayed or cancelled. Airlines and the military have strict policies regarding weather conditions at takeoff and arrival, and weather enroute. Flying through thunderstorms deliberately is a pretty big no no in most cases, and when squall lines can be hundreds of miles long, it can cause a lot of problems.

Remember that the next time someone complains about weather delays or cancellations.. ask if they actually want to fly in weather the pilots don't even want to.am i the only one who for a second thought this would be a Delta flight pic from 1889Hi All. I was on this flight. I assure you, it was not a fun ride. 
http://m.imgur.com/OLjcpcUAt least the front didn't fall off, then we would have to tow it out of the atmosphere In the meantime some poor maintainer took a look at the aircraft and is slightly pissed. Came here to see a busted up plane. Ended up learning so much about aircraft I could probably get a job in aircraft repair. That's gotta be terrifying. I wonder how calm the pilots had to be to keep the passengers calm. 

[Looks like they had to make an emergency landing.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3190510/Delta-flight-make-blind-emergency-landing-hail-storm-gives-plane-cracked-windshield-damaged-nose.html) That's some Day After Tomorrow shit.I like to imagine the pilot pulled an Ace Ventura and hung his head out the window catching hail in his teeth like bullets.That'll buff right out.Recording of the radio between Delta 1889 and ATC.

Get outta here Buzzfeed.This may be a stupid question but, can't they see oncoming thunderstorms/hailstorms on their weather radar and take evasive action, change course etc? I can't believe that a hailstorm like this just pops out of nowhere.You can see in this graphic that pilots tried to fly between towo super cells and one of them closed in quicker than they thought

as I sit on a delta plane over the ocean, fuck this shit.[deleted]I posted this 24 hours before and no one noticed it :(
What am I doing wrongHail can actually be encountered flying between 2 storms.  As it is can be violently thrown out of the clouds.  Now, couple that with the aircraft flying at say 400 knots and you can see the reason how and why this fucked up the plane so bad.  It's also highly advised to keep a safe distance between storm so this doesn't happen.

Source:  I am a pilotThus actually makes me feel better about air travel.As I sit on a Delta flight, getting ready to taxi, I find this less than comfortingAs an engineer myself, if I were on that flight I would write a well-thought-out thank-you letter openly addressed to all of the staff at ~~Boeing~~ Airbus for taking the time to design, test, and build aircraft to take this type of abuse and still get me down on the ground in one piece.

Then I'd write another letter to Delta, thanking them for hiring the calibre of pilots that will land a plane in this condition and get me down on the ground in one piece.

So, if the thief tried to stand, or sit, and get the rope off, the horse just backs up to maintain a taught rope.  That's why the thief is holding onto the tree.

The horse is used to maintaining a taught rope on a cow.

A regular guy who selflessly brought joy to sick children.

RIP man.  I'm really sorry to hear of his passing.

I think it would be nice if the makers of the Batman games and movies gave him a nod.

He was a real hero.Waking up to learn there's one less hero in the world made me suddenly feel very tired again. Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.So he pulled onto the left shoulder, but his car was still partially in the lane and somebody hit him. I wonder if his hazards were on, because that car is jet black and would be really hard to spot at night.I met this guy last year almost to the day. My daughter has a leg length discrepancy and we were at a specialist hospital in Baltimore and he was there giving all the kids lanyards and huge coloring books. We were really looking forward to seeing him again next month when we went back. R.I.P.According to the stories I've read, Mr. Robinson would stop by the nurse's station before he left to find out if there were any children too sick to come out to see him, so that he could make sure to go in to see them specifically.

That's the key to his character.  This wasn't about attention or fame or publicity or promoting some cause of business.  We wouldn't know who this guy was if he hadn't gotten a speeding ticket and accidentally gone viral.  He kept right on doing the same thing after he got famous as he did before he got famous.  And the most important thing to him was that sick kid who wasn't able to come out to see him.

Bruce Wayne is a fiction; an entertaining fiction, but a fiction.  Lenny Robinson was a real man who is a role model for thoughtfulness, selflessness, and making a difference in a small way.

Batman was real, and his name was Lenny Robinson.Here is a video of Lenny visiting sick kids in the hospital.  He truly was a hero deserving of the name, Batman.  The world is a darker place without him.   RIP Batman.

https://youtu.be/fDDBJajLZwwLenny was in a documentary called Legends of the Knight that is on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/80014903) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/795787), if anyone wants to check out his story and see him in action. It's about people who use Batman as an inspiration for themselves or others.

Seeing the kids respond to him is incredible. The world lost a great man.Batman taken out by a Toyota Camry.  This world is fucked up.Too bad it wasn't [this guy instead](http://i.imgur.com/IMc8Kiv.jpg)A tad late to things, but Lenny was actually very close to one of my best friends and his family. A group of my friends (whom all play SSBM together, shouts out to /r/smashbros and the Melee Community) all learned of Lenny's passing this morning straight from our buddy. Although the loss was hard for him and his family, I feel its important to highlight the good that Lenny put into this world. Admittedly, I did not know Lenny nearly as closely as my friend or his family, but I do recall a very specific memory I had with Lenny a couple years ago. At my friend's Bar Mitzvah Lenny was there decked out in full batman attire. He was a class act by all definitions, and went out of his way to make sure every kid, myself included had a memorable experience. An entertaining, genuine, loving individual, Lenny aka Uncle Batman will be missed. RIP Uncle Batman. He was a hero this world needed.

Proof: My friend, the dopest Marth/Fox main in the world with his partner in justice Uncle Batman. Although they weren't technically related, Lenny was considered part of his family.

by a Toyota Camry,

...so help me jesusIf there is an afterlife, he's going to the good side of town. He clearly lived a cool life if he had the money to buy a lambo and a batsuit. He then had the heart to use that for a greater good and in the process gave us all some laughs. RIP Lenny.Such a shame, my son was in a children's hospital and this gentleman was there with his 60's Batmobile that he had recently purchased and was driving back east with.  Got some pics of the [Batmobile](http://i.imgur.com/nKnRe63.jpg?1) and my son still has his [autograph](http://i.imgur.com/XlrPgMI.jpg) hanging up in his room.  
He not only put some smiles on the kids faces but also everyone at the hospital that went out to check out the car.  He was the Hero we needed that day.*batman voice* just here in my garage, with my new Lamborghini that I bought. Fun to drive around Gotham. You know what I like better than Lamborghini's...JUSTICEThats terrible. He's more of a hero than the guy he was dressed as and probably never realized it. RIP Lenny. You were a Batman among men.i live in maryland. i can not tell you how many times since i got my license over 20 years ago now,  the countless people that have been killed by their cars breaking down and them getting out and standing near their car on the side of the road, attempting to change a flat tire, or are under the hood checking the engine. 95 percent of the time these people are safely out of the driving lanes and yet people still manage to hit them. im telling you now for anyone who doesnt know about maryland: 

MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.

ive never seen worse drivers. and ive lived in huge cities. it is the worst here for accidents like this one. it is the reason why we have the highest insurance rates in the united states. if you have the unfortunate problem of living here or for some ungodly reason decide to visit here as a tourist im going to give you a little advice: 

- IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDIAN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE WALL, AND IF THERE IS GRASS BY THE MEDIAN PULL ALL THE WAY OVER INTO THE GRASS!

- NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR CAR ON A MARYLAND HIGHWAY TO CHANGE A TIRE OR LOOK AT YOUR ENGINE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  IF YOU HAVE A FLAT DRIVE IT ON THE SIDE MEDIAN UNTIL YOU CAN FIND AN EXIT. EVEN IF IT MEANS DAMAGING YOUR RIM. YOUR RIM IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE. 

- IF IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR CANNOT BE FIXED DO NOT SIT IN YOUR CAR WAITING UNTIL HELPS ARRIVES!! EVEN IF YOU ARE SAFELY OFF TO THE SIDE. PEOPLE HERE WILL STILL HIT YOU! GET OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE AND STAND AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENCING, BUT YOU'LL BE ALIVE. PEOPLE DIE IN THEIR CARS HERE ALL THE TIME SITTING IN THEM WAITING FOR HELP OR A TOW TRUCK. 

again i reiterate, MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.  take every precaution you can if your car breaks down on a highway here. And a positive light in the world goes out. sad day. Met this guy in person when a psychology practice with which I'm affiliated co-produced a batman documentary. He was a hero who happened to dress up like another hero.

Legit cried when I learned of his passing.*We die every day. A thousand times an hour. Anyone who does this work sees it. Death. Their own... their partner's... their loved ones. We go to work anyway. Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind. Death is powerless against you if you do your job.*
- Batman, JLA Vol 1 72Karma did the opposite here. What a shame. The person who caused his death needs to do the right thing and take over for Lenny Robinson as Batman.>Elizabeth later told him that she was being bullied by other kids at her elementary school. “They don’t believe that Batman is my friend,” she told him.  So, Robinson went to school with her, appearing in full costume before the student body. He told them bullying was wrong and called her onstage to give her a Batman necklace.  Elizabeth, he announced, is my friend.

> The Ankh is a river serpenting through the Sto Plains, reaching the Circle Sea by the town of Ankh-Morpork. By then, it can only be called a river because it moves faster than the banks. You can't drown in the Ankh, but it is really easy to suffocate.

> It has been said that the Ankh is the only river in the multiverse where cops can draw a chalk outline when a corpse is found. 

>There is a legend in Ankh-Morpork of an ancient drum in the palace that will bang itself if ever an enemy fleet is seen sailing up the Ankh, although the legend has died out in recent centuries, partly because it's the Age of Reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the Ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front.There's something alive in there! 
http://imgur.com/QOae9VbAs a Brazilian: if you're thinking of coming here - for the Olympics or otherwise - **DON'T.** The reasons why are too many to mention here, but rest assured that the water in the Guanabara bay should be the least of your concerns.  


Edit: I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but that flashy building behind is one of the many overpriced white elephants our corrupt government has built with money that should be put to better use, built especially for the Olympics. It's called the Museum of Tomorrow, and it supposedly has something to do with sustainable devopment. [This](http://odia.ig.com.br/noticia/rio-de-janeiro/2015-12-20/mar-de-lixo-tomou-conta-da-praca-maua.html) is how my countrymen left the place *on the day of it's inauguration*. (The link is in portuguese, but there's pictures. Use Google Translate).  


I toyed with the idea of making a long, well researched post detailing why people shouldn't come here, or shouldn't support our corrupt government with your travel money, but the research made me too depressed. Just Google shit. Zika virus, Dengue and Chikungunya are as endemic as corruption in all levels of government, the violence in Rio makes Detroit look like EuroDisney, I could go on and on and on... The police is utterly corrupt and incompetent. I'm sure you can find the horror stories of tourists in Brazil for yourselves, so I won't bother.  


I hate it here. Brazil sucks. Our government sucks, but the government is a reflection of the people, and the people suck too. The pictures of our 'Museum of Tomorrow' should tell you all you need to know. Don't come. I'd leave if I could. **DON'T COME**So isn't the whole world gonna see this when it gets televised?I've heard a lot from athletes in the news.

The concept is great as well. Do they use glues or any kinds of bonding agents in sculptures like these? Because I spy a lot of overhang.Isn't this an Ender's game reference??

Edit: NVM, it was *Twilight.*I used to work at bookstore. My proudest moment was when someone came in looking for a book... they couldn't remember anything except that it was pink. I found it.I worked as a librarian for a few years, and we got this kind of question quite often. 

""I forget the name, but it's yellow.""

""Okay, let's go to the yellow book section then, shall we?""

They never seemed to appreciate that response. It was as if they felt I was mocking them or something. one of the thrift shops in my town sorts all their books by colourTotally reminds me of a comic book I've had for years.

http://i.imgur.com/k4ldvcU.jpgFormer bookstore employee, can confirm. Not sure what it's like now, but back then (20+ years ago... jeez I'm old) 90% of the time it was the book Oprah had talked about that day/week/month (I don't recall if she had her ""book club"" at the time or not, because I was a teenage male who did not own a television so 3 strikes against giving a shit about her show). 

If I recall correctly the ""green cover book"" was the Celestine Prophecy, the ""outside party after dark"" book was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Why do I recall these things... because I was asked the same question (more or less) a hundred times. 

This was before everyone had a cell phone, much less a smartphone, so there wasn't an easy way to ""look it up"" (this was when you still had to buy Netscape). I recall a particularly terrible manager of mine responding to my suggestion that we ""make an Oprah's books"" table to help people that I should instead ""expand my knowledge beyond the classics and computer books by watching Oprah regularly.""

We would be ecstatic if you could add a caption or comment to this post mentioning our name and our website bluewillowbookshop.com!!The Fault in Our Stars isn't  in there.One time I was at a fairly large Indigo book store looking for a book I'd seen before online.  Of course I couldn't remember the name of it or the author, so I was just skimming through the section I thought it would be in.  A lady that worked there asked me if I needed help, and I was almost going to just tell her I was fine because I thought there's no way she can help me find this book.  But, i thought what the hell, let's give it a shot.  So i told what I remembered about the book, which was basically that it was 'kinda sciency' and 'had a red triangle on the front'.  She took a second to think about it, then ""Oh yeah, it's over here""  and then she took me a couple rows over, reaches down to the bottom shelf and pulls out the book I was looking for.

Did she just know where every book was?

Was she magic?Twist, all those covers are just dust jackets for other booksOh hell no. This actually happened. Couldn't tell me the name, what it was about our who wrote it but they had seen their friend's copy and it was (kid you not) blue. 

45 minutes of talking about the types of books the friend liked and narrowing it down slowly I found the fucking book. 

They looked at it, said ""oh, yeah. That's what it was called. Thanks"" and walked out of the store without buying a damn thing. 

Fuck that person. If it's have had a weapon, I'd have gone to jail. As a former B&N employee I can concur. This happened way too often, or they would have oddly specific irrelevant information. ""I'm looking for a book. It's got a tree on the cover and is 357 pages long."" 

My other favorite thing was when they would just say ""I'm looking for a book."" I would then grab the nearest book to me, hand it to them, and walk off.

I was in Seattle for business last summer. The first 4 days I was there, the weather was what you think of as typical for Seattle: grey and cloudy.

On the morning of my 5th day there, the clouds cleared out and it became sunny, so I went for a walk around the building I was working in, as I had done every day. 

I turned the corner of this building and I was totally taken by surprise by Mt. Rainier just appearing on the horizon. I'd looked in that direction the last 4 days and seen nothing, so I was so shocked by the size of it. It looked totally fake, towering over the landscape by itself, and I just stood there, staring at it for about the next 5 minutes. It was one of the most beautiful and awe inducing things I ever seen.

so if Mt. Ranier is 60 miles away from Seattle, and a pyroclastic flow travels at 500 mph, and Bob, who is having lunch at Pike Place  stares at the beautiful exploding mountain for 30 seconds before running to his car which just happens to be right outside, how far can Bob get before he's suffocated by searing gas and choking ash as he watches the city disappear?

If anyone is wondering, you get this type of effect by using a zoom lens (like 200 or 300mm) and zooming in, which makes images in the distance appear much bigger. Photos like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/rEIhvQt.jpg) are also created with this method.

Defense attorney Terry Gilbert said that Cuyahoga County prosecutors took a courageous stand not to fight the dismissal of charges against the men. Prosecutors also said they won't stop the trio from seeking more than $4.1 million in compensation from their wrongful imprisonments, reported Cleveland.com.

I think I'd try killing myself after the first decade.Wow. this doesnt make it better but atleast its not
Oklahoma and he's still alive How people can go through something like that without coming out the other end nearly insane and full of hatred and blood-lust for the pieces of shit that put them there, I don't understand. How can you have 27 years of your life taken from you, not to mention spending those 27 years years in a cage with human scum, and not want vengeance? Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from ToledoThe look on his face says it all. Obviously it's great that he was finally exonerated, but this picture makes me sad. You know in those 27 years he has missed so much of his life. No amount of money could fix it, but he deserves billions. I'm 25, he's been in prison longer than I've been alive. No idea if he has kids, but he definitely has(had?) parents. Imagine losing your family for 27 years. Not to mention everyone you know thinking you're a murderer. So so sad.You would be surprised how many innocent are locked up.The face of a man who has been tried.The look on his face says it all. That's 27 years of pain and anguish for a mistake that wasn't his.That man's face. Holy shitI'll point out the case of Ronald Cotton since it hasn't been mentioned yet. He only received $111,000 from the state of South Carolina after being wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade. His case also showed us a few things about handling witness testimony in law enforcement. Firstly, the victim of the crime had said she dedicated all of her effort during her rape to memorizing her attackers face; she identified cotton with certainty as her attacker, and he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Second, the investigators of her case made affirming statements to her following her indication of cotton as her rapist, causing her to believe her choice was the correct one. There were also inconsistencies in the investigation such as the line-up procedure that was used and an improper alibi given by cotton during his first interrogation being the only other piece of evidence used against him. CBS made a documentary about this story called [picking cotton](http://youtu.be/-2oDRfj0vME)source:

Poor guy. I believe he will be compensated handsomely for wrongful imprisonment though. Won't get him back all those wasted years or ease the pain of missing out on a lot of his life, but at least it should help him restart his life or depending on his age have a nice retirement. Ohio: 
$40,330 per year (or amount determined by state auditor) in addition to lost wages, costs, and attorney's fees. So a minimum of $1,088,910.Wouldn't be surprised if this was another case of false accusation from ""eye witnesses""Has anyone noticed the look on this mans face, or was everyone sidetracked by money talks?  The emotions being expressed here are so complex that just this millisecond snapshot of what he was feeling sent shivers through me.  I'm glad this man was released.  I can't even begin to imagine what sort of indignities this man suffered through for 27 years, but I'm sure no amount of money will ever compensate for it.  wow. Im 28, he spent pretty much all of my life in jail. Ive experienced to much wonder and wildness....all while he was locked up. My heart hurts for these peopleI went to a play called ""The Exonerated"" once about people who were locked up for crimes they didn't commit. People would be shocked and disgusted how often this happens. 

I can't even imagine how this guy feels. Imagine, when he went in it was the '80s. So much has changed and he's just been sitting in a cell. The people who go back and work on getting these people exonerated are really heroes. This is why we shouldn't have a death penalty. Think of all the guys that were extinguished instead of exonerated.That is truly upsetting. Can you even imagine? You did not do this thing, this terrible thing - murder - that they say you did. And then you go to jail for life. The thought that you are going to rot in jail forever for something you did not do. How quickly would you lose all hope? And then 27 years later, maybe after you've relinquished any and all thoughts of a life outside of prison, you come to find that you will be freed. 

All of the emotions he is experiencing, I cannot even fathom. I just want to give him a hug. 

This makes me want to be a lawyer and fight for people who are wrongfully imprisoned. No money can recover what that man lost. 27 years is about how long I've been alive. Think of all that time. He lost his chance at a career. At seeing the rise of the internet and tech. He lost his youth. He lost his reputation, his freedom. He probably lost himself. You don't spend nearly 3 decades in prison and not come out a different man. The system didn't take away 27 years of his life. The system took his soul. The system took everything that he ever was and ever could have been.

What's a million dollars to all of that?As a corrections officer, this is why I treat every person under my care as though they are innocent. Because some of them *are*.Sweater vest.

I was shooting The National, and during their song 'I Need My Girl' this guy next to me turned around, got down on one knee, and proposed to his girlfriend. This is almost directly after (I let them have their moment obviously, she was sobbing!) and then I asked their permission to take it. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to ask their names, so I'm hoping someday someone recognizes them. I mean look at his face. That is happiness.She was my elementary school nurse and I went to school with both their sons. They are really great people.  They had a cockatoo that was a fucking dick that would attack people though.

Elsewhere in the thread I read your estimate of ~100,000 sacks / CWT in your storage.

I am guessing/assuming several things there however.

Growing up near these birds I never thought twice about it.

However, I was surprised to find how many people didn't realize that these birds can fly.

[Here is a video of a peacock in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Gr_0cHlpM)

I've never seen them fly long distances however I have seen them fly to high trees (30+ feet tall).

I've never seen them directly fly to the top of a 30ft tree, usually they fly to the lower branches and I think they just work their way to the top.  

When I visited the Arcadia, CA arboretum, a worker said there is a peacock that can fly and perch itself up on one of its 60+ foot tall trees.

[Here's a very out of focus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaO1vhDyrk) but it does show some context of these birds flying out of pretty tall trees.Peacocks are not graceful, my school had them all over the place and it would really be stretching it to call what they do flying.

They flap their wings like a motherfucker, making all kinds of racket, just to get up onto the roof and then when they decide to come down it's like the god damned Hindenburg.  You hear this loud flapping followed by them crashing down and it's all Oh, the humanity.....""

Like a beautiful bull in a china shop.Ah, the majestic disco turkey! Beautiful!

Thanks for sharing!You gotta let me fly!I don't think I've ever seen one in flight before. They're glorious.Pretty sure that's a pokemonIncidentally, it's terrifying to see this coming at you if you don't know what it is.  I used to work at a zoo, and we had free-roaming peacocks everywhere.  One leapt down from its roost and buzzed over the heads of a group of high school girls, doing it's whole ""ee-AWWWW!"" cry thing.  Those girls screamed and ran like hell was on their heels.  It was one of my favorite things I ever saw at that zoo, heh.Such a  nice but rare picture considering they rarely bother to lift that feathery mass off the ground unless they are chasing a small child.

This is in Ladakh in northwest India, and is in the outer Himalayan ranges. Ladakh was part of historical Tibet, and so the culture up there (while uniquely Ladakhi) is more Tibetan than Indian. It is also a part of Kashmir, though (or really, abuts it), so it's a mix of cultures. I think the average altitude of Ladakh is somewhere around 14,000 feet.Looks a bit like a Metal Gear Solid V village :D

You can reach India's highest inhabited village Kibber down the road and it's feels like the end of the world. A small self pulled cable car quarter the size of a mini takes you to the sister village of it across a deep gorge.

It appears closer in the photograph than it does in streetview due to the perspective distortion of the telephoto lens used by the original photographer. However, if you look very closely, you can see many of the same landmarks. You can also see the changes/construction made between 2006 (when this photo was uploaded to [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phuentsholing_Bhutan_Indien.jpg)) and 2013. Keep in mind this is an extremely humid climate.

This photograph just happens to be taken under the face of some construction that caused debris to fall into the as-yet-uncovered sewer. The sewer is now covered with concrete slabs, which now serves as a walkway with fencing and doesn't look that bad.

A further exercise would be to examine the nearby streetview on either side of the border. Then you'll see there is not such a disparity as is attempted to be portrayed whenever this photo is posted.They need to do the needful on the India side there. Couple things I noticed, learned, and saw when in India for business. I was in a city, so I can't speak for the rest of the country nor can I speak about rural areas. I did not live there, I only did work and left. And before anybody thinks I'm disrespecting India, I loved my trip and I'd go back.

1) Trash was thrown on street sides. Often people gathered it up and tossed it in large piles in more centralized areas. People rummage through the trash looking for food. Then animals do the same. Whatever is left either stays there or is taken by the poorest of the poor. During the rainy season, this trash often ends up in drainage systems which end up clogged so the streets flood. Then someone is sent in to clean the drains and that person often removes lots of trash and puts it back into the large pile. The cycle continues. While I was there for just under two weeks, three people died cleaning drains.

2) The most wealthy parts of the city look like most ""first world"" cities. They have very new high rise buildings which are well maintained, cleaned, and they employ lots of people doing lots of small jobs. When you have so many people to employ, things that are taken for granted in other places become a job for someone.

3) Everybody knows someone that can be paid to get something done. Here in the US you need licensed contractors to build buildings and you need licensed electricians and plumbers. You need to have a contractor or your utility company come hook up power, phone, sewer, etc. I experienced more pay-offs in my short time in India than I can even believe. Right down to my driver paying off the guards at my hotel to just let us through instead of stopping us every day for bomb checks. While this social system employs lots of people that take a small cut at every level, it's obviously rife with abuse.

4) The resources required to run a single unified nation with over a billion people in it is unfathomable. And since India is what many would consider a developing country, those resources are scarce and badly needed. Imagine trying to provide medical care for a BILLION people, many of whom make the equivalent of a few US dollars a year. Imagine the public works project that would be required to collect, sort, recycle, and properly dispose of trash for a city that has 20-20k people per square kilometer! Just the amount of trash produced is staggering and now you have to pay people to collect it and properly handle it?!


Again, I loved my trip to India and I'd go again in an instant. It really taught me a lot about the world and how I looked at it through the lens of my own daily experience. I saw human beings eating plastic bags for food. I also saw the Taj hotel. I saw things that made me uncomfortable like the tourist traps set up around the Mumbai terror attacks, and I saw beautiful city streets with big box stores and the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen. I think that extreme contrast changed me a bit for the better, but I can say that not every part of India looks like this, but I suspect a lot of the areas not chock full of rich people do.[deleted][California | Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Border_Mexico_USA.jpg)I wish we can see more left side tho but thats quite disturbingLooks like my gfs side of the bed vs mine.

[deleted]Late to this and is probably going to be buried, but I have lived in Bhutan for approximately 3 years (2002, 2003, various summers) because my father was posted there (Indian Army has many projects in Bhutan).

Reminds me of the [insectarium](http://imgur.com/5NqIXkg) at the St. Louis Zoo.[Google's street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.9507235,-90.0632551,3a,37.5y,87.62h,71.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swAEkZd2KUbI-LF6AgfavxA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)By far my favorite moment from visiting the New Orleans aquarium was pranking a little kid.

There was a concave viewing window in the big tank, but head on, you could tell.  There was a little girl sitting head-on but a bit far away.  It seemed she didn't notice that she could poke her head into the concavity to look around.

I went up to the window and said, ""Hey, watch this,"" and placed my hand, mime-style, on where she seemed to think the glass was.  And then *pushed.*

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""  And she ran off.

I later saw her frantically pointing at me to who I assumed was her mom as I was leaving.I love how that whole take is supposed to show how those oil rigs provide a great undersea ecosystem.  Fish love Big Oil!They gave us the aquarium so that we dont have to worry about the real ocean anymore. It's also of note that the tank's design and layout are intended to simulate the bottom of an oil rig, so their sponsorship (while certainly eyebrow-raising) DOES sort of make sense.

As a New Orleanian, I know they have the money. I don't like it, but I know it. And I'd rather the kids see it, while the adults roll their eyes at the irony.I thought the same thing when I went there for the first time. 

I always imagined that one day they would put on a kids presentation, showing that there is no way that oil can harm sea life, because water and oil separates. There for, the fist are fine. Or some other BS like that. I was working offshore on a Shell platform when they accidentally pumped 80bbls of Biocide into the Gulf.... ""Oops! My bad...."" 
Reported? = Nope""We're sorry...""The lone survivors.Look at all the fish we kill!they spelled ""destroyed"" wrong I fucking HATED this when I went to NOLA Aquarium.  The entire exhibit is about how the oil rigs provide substrate for coral to grow and create habitat for fish and other marine life.  Yeah I get it that there are fish near oil rigs but not a fucking WORD about the oil spill or cleanup or anything.  Twisted.""Nature - sponsored by corporations"" [deleted]Y'all laugh, but after the oil spill we had a big problem with people marking the BP sign. People would use anything red to cross out that sign: crayons, pencils, markers, sharpies, and most commonly lipstick. After it was all said and done and everything cooled down, AAOA had to buy a new sign. Someone usually stayed by the sign on busier days.

The whole Gulf of Mexico exhibit is geared towards promoting oil companies because to some extent, they actually do help. The right side of the exhibit shows a barren seabed. A few scattered rocks provide minimal cover for small fish, so normally you only see medium to large fish and sharks. On the left side, there's a quarter scale model of an oil rig, which provides hiding spaces for smaller fish which in turn attract even more medium and larger fish. In recent years, reef balls and pipes have been added to show other ways of promoting smaller fish to move in.

Oil rigs, when properly maintained, benefit everyone with perks that are not just about oil. Although making sure you don't spill tons upon tons of oil into the ocean really helps.

Edit: Look, I'm stating this as what they teach their volunteers and how it's presented. This is what they taught me for the years and thousands upon thousands of hours that I worked there and this is the image that AAOA wants to present to the public.

And if you think for one second that I feel that the Horizon disaster was an afterthought, then you have another thing coming. I watched those struggling pelicans with the same sense of hopelessness as I did upon ""the grand pre-open tour"" after Katrina when we basically had nothing alive save for a few animals who could breath air and a couple very stubborn fish. Having gone through nearly a complete aquarium's worth of animals in 2005, if you were there working and if your house had been damaged, you had to develop a very dry sense of humor.

Edit edit: OK, I get it. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was very bad. Y'all act like this didn't effect me, my family, my friends, my workplace, or anything. Please, stop PM'ing me nasty things. Y'all are worse than the lady who thought that penguins were fish and that I couldn't be possibly be right in saying that they were bird and followed me around the rest of the afternoon trying to have a debate to defend her penguin-fish platform.Reminds me of the song Big Yellow Taxi:

*They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum*

*And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them*

*No, no, no*

*Don't it always seem to go*

*That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone*

Who wants a tutorial?

Edit: I'll make a tutorial tomorrow, sorry but it's not a straight forward filter like you're hoping (I was too!). Some people have asked if you just fold the image, that's certainly possible but as you've all seen it creates major artefacts, due to the warping. It's a great place to start though as it helps to establish what you should be aiming for. Those of you familiar with Photoshop this technique is essentially a matte painting especially with more complicated images. 

Basically you don't bend the image, you duplicate, rotate as necessary and then mask the connecting line with any techniques you can. Such as using the clone tool or selecting objects and spreading them across the connecting line to conceal the stitch. Oceans and beaches work well because our eyes are expecting to see repeated patterns which can hide the appearance of repeated sections. 

I'm pretty sure you chaps who are familiar with photoshop will get the idea. I think it does look better than the original because of that slant on the left. And the contrast between the land and the sea makes it even better. Amazing job! This one looks better! Good job!I thought this image looked familiar. I've used it before in my work

The [Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome) is the first domed stadium, and has been sitting unused for about a decade. 

I personally think this is a great idea. Houston is a huge metro area (4th most populous in the country) but lacks a world-class amusement or water park since Six Flags closed. And the summers here can be unbearable, so going indoors is a great idea. Now who's paying for it? That'll be an issue of course.This is not an *old* airship hangar. The building was finished in November 2001. It belonged to a company called CargoLifter that wanted to build freight airships but went bankrupt before any airship was built. They basically only built the hangar and a few hot air balloons for testing.  
  
After that the hangar was re purposed as this waterpark.

[Edit: Looks like it](https://vimeo.com/61845373)This hangar was actually built in 1998, and has nothing to do with the nazis or hindenburg. it was built for an airship project called Cargolifter, which would have been used to transport extremely heavy things into and out of berlin. Before they built the zeppelin they noticed that this could not work, because as soon as the cargo would have been released, the airships high bouyancy ( to lift the several-ton Cargo) would have catapulted the ship up. But the hangar was built anyway. I cannot recommend the park in it, its horrible because there is no sky, and very non-tropical lightingThat middle part could be turned into lazy river. Not really old. It was built in 2000.

I actually stayed there two years ago. There is a small hotel on the island (on the side closest to land, next to the bridge). 

Here are some pictures of the hotel : [Image 1](https://d1p98clqffzjxh.cloudfront.net/lazareto/L13405.jpg). [Image 2](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cc/0f/c7/tower-and-stone-cottage.jpg).

I ran up to the top of the island every day of our stay. There's a church up there, and a couple of lookouts, one of which can be seen in OP's picture (top of the island, closest to land).

What hasn't been mentioned here is that the island and town is pretty much uninhabited - a lot of the building have been restored for historical purposes.

Currently much of the town is closed off to the public - buildings and areas that are open have been converted to tourist shops, bars and hotels. It's a pretty cool place. Perhaps when the restorations are fully complete there will be room for more people to stay in the town.

Without a doubt, my favourite part of Monemvasia is the little enclosed ""pool"" on the side. I couldn't find any great pictures, but here is a [pretty decent one](http://www.mediterranean-cruise-advice.com/images/IMG_0082.jpg), showing the little enclosed natural pool, which curves around and continues beyond the picture. I really enjoyed staying there.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that [in this conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2tupdd/the_hidden_town_of_monemvasia_greece/co2i6zr?context=10000), /u/woohalladoobop points out that the building OP is talking about is a city-owned home for the mayor to live in, and claims that he lived there.

> I actually come from Monemvasia. That house is owned by the city for the mayor to live in. Fun fact: Mayor Spiros Anagna was thrown out of a window over the cliff by some townsfolk in the 1920's after he was caught having an affair with an underage girl who worked at the house.

The house isn't a house, it's a church, named Agia Sofia (pronounced ayia sofia). [Here is a picture](https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/38470106.jpg) of some tourists next to it (not my picture).

EDIT: Thanks for the gold![This house on the right side of the ridge](http://i.imgur.com/RuC1quY.png) looks like a super-villain's hidden lair disguised as a mansionWell, not so hidden now...Man, these guys are never getting Google Fiber...Some great memories from this place! My favourite ones:

* The stairs that lead you underneath and outside the town walls, to a platform facing the open sea (The Myrtoon Pelagos (pronounced ""Mir-to-on""). People could dive in, the waters are amazing, and there are some steps to help you back up. In the summer, children would joyfully sit on the platform and let the waves wash over them. 
* The view from the center of the town square facing up towards the rock and the steps leading to the top is beautiful, brings to mind something out of a fairytale.
* There are some great coctail bars up there (it helps that I spent my summer there with great friends as well)!

**EDIT: cannot format....This town has an awesome history. For the Crusade buffs out there, when Constantinople was displaced from the Byzantine Empire after the 4th Crusade, many various Crusader kingdoms were carved out from Greece. Monemvasia held out though for the longest time as a pirate town/raiding point and proved to be a headache for the occupying Crusader kingdoms. Even when the entire Peloponnesus was under Crusader control, this one seaside enclave held out. Its amazing.**[Spanakopita!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wgR_4TwHOQ)**

I searched my files, found only a few, just for you (+plus extra cthulhu snacks from the local fishermen). [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ACawPFh.jpg) It's a majestic village, not an island, as someone pointed out. 

Some people are asking about the local economy. It's mostly tourism. But Peloponisos, the mainland, has a lot of agriculture too. It's one of the greek places that is open for business not only for the summer, like the greek islands, but it's a perfect destination for winter travelling too. Peloponisos is FULL of majestic, amazing places of great beauty and mythological value. It's a REAL shame that we're not doing more stuff with this place :(

I see Mr. Bean.This was the cause of my British moment ever: Today I was held up in traffic due to a bobby on a motorbike who was escorting Mr Bean. I swear I levelled up. Mr. Bean came out in 1990? Weird, I always think of it as being an 80's show. By far the greatest Electrical Engineer to graduate from Oxford. ([not joking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson#Early_life_and_education))Best episode, in my opinion.The first time I ever saw Mr. Bean was when a short episode played in a movie theater before Tim Allen's *The Santa Clause* in 1994. 

It was [the one where he meets the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JizFAhEpiEc), and at that point in all my 11 years, it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.[new whip](http://imgur.com/zfQ3xOx.jpg)I have always loved mr bean. Both my parents are deaf, and would always watch this show. Not only do I love it cos its a super funny show, and Rowan is amazing, but I always loved the fact my parents could watch it and understand everything! 

I wish I could let Rowan and everyone involved know just how important this show is to me.Better put a padlock on my car just to make sure no one steals it. Oh I'm going shopping, I better try everything in the store before I buy it. Man I have party guest over my house but no food, wait I got it chocolate covered twigs..... Teddy This scene is one of my earliest memories in life. I remember staying up late watching tv with my parents when this came on. I was so excited when he was going down that hill losing control of the brake pedal with his broomstick. The second he drove into the madras van, causing the HUGE feather explosion, I had my first case of laughter cramps! I laughed so hard i fell down the from the couch onto our coir rug. Thinking about fact that I fell down due to uncontrollable laughing multiplied the laughing with a factor 10 and made me lose track of time and pain from the fall. My dad had to pick me up to make sure I could breath. I like to believe that this is what shaped me into being the guy I am today, always trying to make people laugh and have fun.
PS. Screw Rupert and Hubert!So who is really controlling the car? That's so Bean... at least he's buckled and using a mop responsibly.Rowan, you beautiful bastard...Mr. Bean was awesome. English wasn't my first language but that wasn't necessary to enjoy it as a kid. I LIVE, I BEAN, AND I LIVE AGAINI googled him and I cant take any picture of him seriously.

On the red carpet, news, in a suit, in a tux even on the mans goddamn wedding day. It just looks wrong.

He will always be the hilariously retarded Mr. Bean to me.Can't we just turn this into a Black Adder quote-fest.  I'll start:

""Oh dear, it's Richard III"".The PBS Chicago affiliate used to show Me Bean episodes every Sunday night when I was a kid. I loved that show.He celebrates his own show?

Finally something I feel qualified to talk about...

These are, indeed, German turrets, called pillboxes, that were designed to overlook the small town of Saint Malo and defend it against a joint American/British attacks.

Now, if you don't know anything about St Malo, here is a picture to set the mood:

https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&rais=1&oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.letriskel.co.uk%2Fimages%2Frsz_st_malo_june_09_052.jpg&sp=d4f6453f5ef9ca2a9434f0309d0103d2

Now, St Malo is an old medieval city, surrounded by enormous walls. The Germans built a fortress in St Malo proper, along with a series of bunkers in a small hill overlooking the city, the only visible part of which are these gun turrets.

They also built another series of bunkers and AA guns on an island (called Cezembre), which is about 25 minutes away from St Malo, effectively turning the city and its bay into one enormous fortress.

In 1944, shortly after the Normandy Landing, the Allies were faced with a difficult task: either ignore St Malo and risk that the German fortress would attack their rear lines (as it is fairly close to Normandy) or try take the city and suffer heavy losses.

The solution taken was dramatic: the American and the British air forces fire-bombed the city and the Cezembre island for several days, essentially destroying pretty much every building within the city walls, and turning the island bunkers into a pile of rubble. I have seen old German AA guns on that island, and they were warped from the heat.

The final operation saw British ships shelling the German gun turrets from the sea. Pretty much each turret is pockmarket with these shells, and you can actually put your fist in some of these all the way inside the turret itself. The poor bastards inside did not stand a chance.

American ground troops then swept in and the Germans surrendered pretty much without a fight. My family is from there and my father and grand-father used to tell me stories about this battle.

You can look up Saint Malo on Wikipedia, and there are also tons of other sites that talk about the place, which is very beautiful and interesting. The real shame is that the original German bunkers are now closed.

EDIT: well, my first real comment on Reddit, and I got Gold! Thanks!!That particular gun emplacement overlooks the harbour entrance at St-MaloCrazy and saddening to look at that, and think ""Wow, look at those holes! That must have been intense!""

But then to realise I'm 30yrs old, and in all probability it was guys a full decade younger than me sitting in there utterly terrified wanting to go home.

That line between ""well that is certainly interesting"" and ""jesus fuck, this actually happened..."" is a complicated one.Bullet holes make it look like a slightly melted chocolate.Good grief what kind of gun made the holes?

Cause im thinking of this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtopxCjs518

Obviously its not the same quality steel but still.Is that a shell you can see stuck in one of the holes? About a third of the way from the top towards the left side.I went to Normandy 2 years ago while in France for work and two things really struck me:

One, you'd have to be insane to storm that beach. It's wide and deep and it was easy to see the massive advantage the gunners had over the invaders. I knew this based on everything that I have read or seen, but nothing prepares you for seeing it in real life.

Two, while you could still see and even walk into the pill boxes and other fortification that the Germans built, they were starting to be overcome by nature. That was amazing to me. In 50 years those scars will be gone.

From my favorite poem *The Death of a Ball Turret Gunner*

*From my mother’s sleep I fell into the State,*

*And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.*

*Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,*

*I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.*

*When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.*This is crazy, I visited France a few years ago and spent a couple days in St. Malo. My friends and I camped on the hill across from the city that had a handful of these pillboxes. I was actually *just* telling my parents last night about how of all the historical landmarks I saw *these* pillboxes were probably the most awe inspiring. All of them were absolutely covered in bullet holes, you could actually find plenty of bullets that had been fused into the metal 70 years ago. There was just something so incredibly *real* about seeing these things in person.You sure it's German?

""Yeah...totally""Looks amazing...but this is reddit so let's spoil the party.

It's not functional, piping goes straight up, meaning most of the heat goes up the chimeny. No baffling. Dangerously hot to the touch. No ceramic tiles below it means if you open the doors your house will burn down down. Couches are too close with a fabric throw that will go up in flames. Uneven bottom will mean it will be difficult to start a proper fire. Limited (no) intake control (EDIT: Draft, I had a brainfart on that). If it's a real surplus mine it will burn through pretty quickly, constant heat will ruin the integrity of the metal. A season of maple will destroy it. Good luck opening the hatch with metal handles. Also the fire looks fake.

It's an art piece. Pure design without any function. It's a concept, and one I do really like. Looks really great. Take it for what it is.does this look like a painting to anyone else?Looks cool, I'd worry about the lack of any protection underneath shielding the wooden floor.

Comment thread in the Dutch subreddit[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2nv3gx/you_will_not_be_arrested_for_using_drugs_in/) Avoid the classic Pulp Fiction situation. As a graphic designer, I love how practically everything in the Netherlands is professionally designed. Isn't it usually possession that's illegal, not the actual consumption?In Australia, at school and university I was always reminded that no matter what the person has ingested, legal or not; it is always safe for them to ring an ambulance. They will only ring the police if there is a dangerous and violent situation.

Paramedics are there to save your life, not to criminally charge you.Little story about some of the victims involved in this.

2 British tourists collapsed on the street after buying and using cocaine that turned out to be white heroin sold as cocaine, both got brought to a hospital. 

After they get some medication one of them decides he feels fine and bails. When the hospital staff realizes he's gone they inform the police who eventually track him down that same night, he was quite easy to spot since the first responders cut open his clothes to get to his chest and he was wearing those clothes. 

He refuses to go back to the hospital, the police have no choice but to detain him and put him in a temporary holding cell where they continuously check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know the exact details on this but he stops breathing/heart stops, the EMT starts CPR. Gets picked up by an ambulance and dies on his way to the hospital.

Meanwhile, at pretty much the exact moment the other guy stops breathing too and survives because he decided to remain in the hospital.

TL;DR: 2 tourists use white heroin thinking it was cocaine, one of them dies after leaving the hospital and the other lives.That's a PSA you will never find in the USA. Where in the world do you get arrested after going to the hospital for an OD?The red-light district in Amsterdam has some pretty dodgy characters. I found the tip is to never stop moving, do not even acknowledge the existence of people trying to sell you things and above all do not show how stoned/drunk you are.

http://imgur.com/l9dmmQ0There's electronic signs all over the busy tourist spots conveying the same message. It's quite comical sometimes how dealers approach you so openly around the common bar areas like Rembrandtplein.Its amazing to see that they actually care and not just let drug users die.Here is a little story from personal experience if you feel like reading something. I currently work in the caregiver field for developmentally disabled adults. Upon starting the job, you find out that the mental illnesses you're dealing with are really just the extreme end of a spectrum that a lot of totally normal people with high IQs are also on. They're really not that different from us besides the fact that for a lot of conditions, their brain cannot resist the urge to do something even when it knows it's wrong. We can know better and learn and resist urges but no matter how many times I teach a client something, when the situation comes back up, the chances of them retaining the knowledge are unfortunately pretty low (but not impossible). With that being said, the following story is about someone with dev. disabilities, but the reactions their brain are having to the events in the story are totally normal and something that we all experience.

You quickly realize that the #1 trick to stopping acts of defiance in your client is to not give them something to defy.

For example we have one girl with oppositional defiance disorder. There is a set time for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, snack in that order. She constantly will cause a scene or have a documented behavior because she wants food at the times that aren't set for food.

Now she is an adult, and she should be allowed to have food any time, but we realized that it wasn't even about eating, it was that she HAD to break the rules. There was something about a rule for her that caused her to want nothing more than to overcome it and break the rule. It has a lot more to do with wanting personal control over your own life, but we call it the forbidden fruit effect.

So we solved her issue by taking away all snack times, dinner times, lunch times, breakfast times, and letting her tell us when she wanted to eat. When she wanted a 3rd or 4th snack we gave it to her. We weighed her after a week and she had gained 10 pounds in literally 1 week.

She was very upset and we explained to her the natural consequences of eating too much. We taught her how to eat healthy and feel healthy. We told her she can still eat whatever whenever she wants.

""No I want to eat healthy, I don't want to be fat.""

From then on she asks for one snack or no snack after dinner. She doesn't go crazy anymore trying to get food at times that she isn't supposed to have it because we totally took away the whole matrix of scheduled times and calories and all that stuff. We took away all of the rules to break and replaced it total freedom coupled with personal accountability.

I really believe a lot of the things people do, especially teenagers, are done 10x more because you're told not to do them. No one wants to be told by another human being with just as many flaws and shortcomings as them that they're not responsible enough to handle their own shit around some food or a drug or whatever else it is that's being forbidden.

**TL;DR A recount from an experience I had working with those with developmental disabilities that relates to the whole idea of the forbidden fruit effect. We took a girl with oppositional defiance disorder who consistently wanted to defy all the house rules and removed every rule and let her control her own life, but showed her the natural results of eating too much or not being responsible. She learned that being in control means it's on her and no one else to make the right choices, and she started making them.**[Gotta love Hamsterdam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHkrZECnfs)at night there is a LOT of coke dealers in the streets of amsterdam, most of them African (as in, actually recently from africa) ","{'Extraversion': 0.761, 'Sadness': 0.059729, 'Analytical': 0.723, 'Disgust': 0.117224, 'Joy': 0.057378, 'Emotional_Range': 0.795, 'Conscientiousness': 0.079, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Tentative': 0.112, 'Openness': 0.261, 'Anger': 0.941726, 'Agreeableness': 0.681, 'Fear': 0.961212}"

I did not take this photo!! I found it on /r/newsokur. More people needed to see this.

This seems to be the source! but I am not too sure, anyone speak the language? : http://nurullah.net/article/Keske-Hep-Cocuk-Kalabilsek.htmlI know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it.Survey says...""This is not a camera""I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it?Those hats are adorable.I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this ""camera"". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. ""excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?"" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were ""taking pictures of people in their homes"" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police.I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, ""take my picture!  take my picture!""  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a ""hey, come here and look at this..""  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.  That is so fucking cute.I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were ""Are you guys about to widen the road"" and ""Don't take my picture with that"". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.  lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses. I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. ""Oh taking pictures, smile!""

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave. We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, ""It's actually not a camera."" Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, ""Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures."" With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole. I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!  Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks ""how do you ride that thing?"" I replied with ""I clinch my cheeks real tight.""Aw thats adorable!Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background.I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: ""I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera"". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off.I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.  Which would probably be the most boring subreddit.Used to annoy the hell out of me when I was working with a surveyor, ""Do you wanna take my picture?"" No, it's a theodolite, it does not take pictures, it measures angles and distances, and even if it WAS a camera, why on earth would I want a picture of you?I have always wanted to know what one actually sees when looking through one of those.

My Mum and Dad moved out at the beginning of November. They bought the house and lived there since 1967 or '68. It's going to feel weird on my visit home this summer.Ahh Sam Adams Brewery. They let you mail a postcard for free. I mailed one to myself because it was the only address I knew. Mine read:

Hey. I'm drunk in Boston!

Don't forget to pay student loans next Monday. 

Yours truly,
""Marge, this may be the beer talking, but you got a butt that won't quit. They got these pretzels here... hgfhtrdhfgdFIVE DOLLARS getouttahere...""This makes me want to send mail to all of my old addresses*P.S.: Have you found the safe already?*Whenever my friends travel, i tell them to find a local stranger to write me postcards.  Then I'd forget about it.  By the time I receive it in the mail, its always a fun little surprise.I feel like this and the starbucks bears are viral ads.Holy crap, I used to sort those postcards. 

I temp'd at the Boston Beer Company's headquarters in Southie when I lived there for a few years, and this would have been in October of 2014. As the front receptionist, it was my job to sort through those postcards that came from the brewery and make sure nothing vulgar got through. Probably so that the many, many fantastical drawings of penises didn't wind up on places like Reddit and get associated with Sam Adams brand... 

I used to put stickers on dirty messages and still send them through because it made me laugh. Occasionally I even added a note of my own to the postcard if it was really funny. It was a really annoying part of the job because they come in huge bags, but it was also pretty fun because of hilarious messages like this one. 

You'd be surprised how much this occurs. Thanks, dad.

Please come home.

And start going to AA again.This is actually ridiculously sweet.  I'd send them a message back saying the same. :) This is way too BostonThe only addresses I know are my current address and P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, SydneyI once made the mistake of letting a man into my house who had said he'd grown up there. Once he got in things got weirder until I nearly called the cops because he ended up wanting to pull back the wallpaper in ""his"" bedroom to see where he had written his girlfriend's name inside a heart on the wall.Inside is going to be pictures of all the orgies that took place in that house. Yay holidays!What's Reddit's general consensus on /r/pics that's just photo of some text written by OP and a story that is hard to verify?Hey, those are my initials. Did... did I get drunk and write someone a postcard?Being drunk in Boston only writes off 2 people in all of Bostonp.s.: Why did you paint the walls? Why did you clean the floor? Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?I was at a party once and these two guys were just kinda doing your basic small talk. One mentions his hometown, other guy used to live in that hometown. Turns out the guy he was talking to was from the family his parents sold their old house to! They became really good friends after that too, it was one of the funnier bromances I've ever seen.The lady who grew up in the house I now own is creepily attached to it, and often emails me to subtly reprimand me for any changes I've made to the house (apparently she drives past it frequently).

She also stops by to visit at least once a year, and tried to get me to agree to swap houses with her for a weekend.

My husband doesn't think this is weird at all.I had to make a comment, because this had 666 comments and I just couldn't leave it like that.

Couldn't use vacation, and the company was super slack at hiring new managers. She quit in June when she found out the district director wasn't interviewing the people she found to replace the people she was missing and wasn't doing anything to help her. Fuck Wet Seal.

EDIT 5: And international news: http://www.businessinsider.com/wet-seal-workers-leave-a-sign-2015-1My dad calls this store Moist Walrus.I love the Internet because 20 years ago companies could do shit like this without any consequences. Today, there's at least a chance the company will have to address this in order to avoid the negative publicity and backlash if the story gets out long term employee's without raises is extremely common unfortunately. I still work part time in retail, but only because I have been there since before a pay freeze. A lot of very hard workers trying to get by for $8 an hourWet Seal Dayton Mall, saw this yesterday

Looking at yahoo finance, their stock price has been below $1 since September, meaning they will be delisted from the NASDAQ soon. Heading for a bankruptcy very soon.  
[Fly you fools](http://i.imgur.com/zCZLR1n.jpg)I work in one of the Wet Seal stores this is happening in and it's awful! Our sick time is not ""given"" to use, we have to accrue it like vacation days. My staff was given 24 hours notice before their last shift and my assistants and myself are having to work in the store by ourselves so corporate can avoid paying out extra money to associates. I also have an associate in my store who has been with me for over a month, her pay card was not activated by corporate and when we called about it we find out the lady in charge of that department had taken a vacation and literally tons of other girls were not receiving money on their pay cards either. This whole situation is crappy for all people on the bottom of the totem pole and I'm honestly just glad to be done with this company. Same story here in [North Carolina](http://imgur.com/j8b4jHn).  I know a store manager over there who has been told nothing but lies over the last month when questioning why their store wasn't receiving new inventory.  Classy company.  That's pretty fucked up. Not getting paid for your sick leave is par for the course... Most retail employees don't even get paid sick days. A $95,000 raise for the CEO is legitimately undetectable in terms of corporate cash flow. That being said, giving your employees one day to find a new job is absolutely awful. My girlfriend was a manager at Borders, the book store, when before they went bankrupt. The employees were strung along for quite some time, but eventually they came clean and said ""we're closing in 3 weeks, liquidate everything"". Most of the employees stayed during that time because it was pretty much the easiest retail job they could ever have for 3 weeks. ""What're they gonna do, fire me?""My partner works for H&M. He's a 5 year employee. He now has 5 weeks vacation, 14 days 'personal' time and healthcare for both of us (domestic partner insurance) that costs less that $50/month with a tiny deductible. I've worked for Apple, Samsung and Canon. I've never had benefits as good as he gets. 

Just chiming in to say retailers can do right by their people. as a stocky 30 year old male, I will be sure to never shop there again.From someone who is ignorant, why are so many Wet Seal stores closing?
Good for them. I have no idea what Wet Seal is but good for them. A month with no check, commendation to the person who didn't burn that building to the ground.Shitty ass corporations man. I worked at a pizza hut a few years back and they told us the store was going to eventually close, but never gave us a date. So I stroll into work one day and find the store locked, and closed signs all over it. Not even a call. Good riddance. 

I hope those poor employees find something else. A place where they aren't so much screwed over. They are lucky all the employees did is make a sign, and not just take turns shitting on the floor before walking outMy company's CEO got a $3mil raise last year while we were in financial hardship.Going to be a tough week for Wet Seal's social media team...if they even have jobs anymore.","{'Extraversion': 0.455, 'Sadness': 0.055768, 'Analytical': 0.067, 'Disgust': 0.084177, 'Joy': 0.061465, 'Emotional_Range': 0.777, 'Conscientiousness': 0.204, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Tentative': 0.215, 'Openness': 0.274, 'Anger': 0.968337, 'Agreeableness': 0.591, 'Fear': 0.037523}"

Ok, I got a response back from Arcaid. They told me the photo was placed with them by EWA, and gave me the name of a photographer, Friedhelm Thomas. http://www.ewastock.com/preview/83516

EDIT: 

I was able to speak with Friedhelm Thomas on the phone this morning. It was hard to communicate because of the language barrier, however I wrote them an email in English with a link to the image, asking if he took the photo and if he did, where it was taken. If they respond, I will post it here.


EDIT 2:

The photographer replied to my email, confirming that the photographer is Friedhelm Thomas and that they would respond on the weekend, when they have some help with responding to my email in English.


EDIT 3:

Friedhelm Thomas told me the photo is from 1985 and the steel and glass structure was dilapidated at that time. He does not know what happened to it since then.
The exact location of the photo was over the hotel Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo near Lake Como in northern Italy. The location of the “wintergarden” is Griante/Cadenabbia. The park belongs to Villa Maria, a variant of the world-renowned garden of Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo.

EDIT 4:

It looks like the Villa Maria has undergone a restoration since 1985.
Here is a [photo](http://www.mondolariano.it/GrianteCadenabbia/serrav.jpg) of it after
 restoration- [photo] (http://www.arteliberty.it/immaginiliberty/como/serra.jpg)

Another angle: [photo] (Here is a photo taken from abovhttp://www.alephcomo.com/Gallerie.aspx?gid=1&fid=1e:)
Here is what Google has to say about Villa Maria: ""Villa Marie is surrounded by a splendid public park, in the centre of the village. It was built between 1889 and 1892 for the will of Martin Clerc and was completed by a heir of his, called Josephine May. The project was realized by the famous architect Giacomo Mantegazza.""I'm always curious what would cause a place like this to become abandoned.

Edit: [just wow](http://imgur.com/qBLSJ5s)I lived with a roommate who had a great dog.  I loved that dog to the moon and back.  But it would bark at passers by.  It's the single only aggressive thing she ever did.  We didn't want her barking at the neighbors or their kids so we used to say ""No, dog!  No barking!""  and she'd just look at us, then keep barking.

Then one day I kind of imagined what must be going through her head...  

She's like, ""OH FUCKING SHIT! There are some assholes outside our badass good-guy-team castle! They're THREATENING our goddamn HOME fuckin' BASE!! RARARARAWR RAHRAWR!!!!""

And all she gets from us is just, ""Bad, Dog! SHHHHHHhhhhhh! No Barking!!""

Panicked, she puzzles out the problem, realizing suddenly, *Oh SHIT! That's right!  You two helpless yet lovable lumps don't have the amazing sense of smell and super-dog-hearing that I do!*  But not to worry, that's exactly her job.  Let the humans know what's going on so they can let her out the front door to start killing shit.

Dauntless, she vows not to let the interlopers get by without warning everyone in the house first. 

""I WILL FUCKING PROTECT YOUUUUUUUuuuu! RHAWRHAHRAHRAWR RAWRRAH!!""

And suddenly feel like the poor girl is just trying to keep us safe.  So after I imagined this whole scenario out I kind of decided to try changing my approach the next time.  So the following interaction went completely differently.

She started barking, and this time instead of, ""Shhh, NO!"" I was like ""Good Job, pooch! I see them too!"" And I came up and patted her on the back.  And she chilled right the hell out.  Back to her nap.

I swear this worked 100% of the time.  She even kind of just started the habit of looking at me. If I was looking back she would just let it be.

""We good? Yeah, we good.""

I miss that dog.  She's old now but still healthy. My roommate and I moved out of that place.  He's got some kids for the dog to play with so she's probably very happy.  

But I felt like the damn dog whisperer when I pulled that mind meld shit with the dog.  I bet it'll work for others too.  Seriously try it.  Let me know.

[Edited some formatting mistakes]Am I the only one who wouldn't trust random strangers with this?Of course now he will forever be pestering passers by for treats, which could potentially make some people quite nervous.Now he'll learn to bark at strangers to get a treat. Cute idea, not solid in practice. On the other hand, that could be the lesser of two weevils.ITT:  Lots of people who don't understand how dogs work.That's a great idea! But aren't you afraid that he will warm up to strangers given this habit even if it's a robber in the middle of the night?Irish Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier? What if he accidentally bites someone and they call animal control?Has nobody noticed that they spelt it thaks, not thanks?I don't agree with this approach, especially in this context. Dog will grow to expect treats from strangers. What about the one time that the stranger puts their hand out and there is no treat?  I'd prefer food refusal from strangers and to engage/train the dogs with other people around in order to desensitize them.As great as this idea may seem, it's extremely counter intuitive.
I'm certified by the APDT and focus on dog psychology and behavior, and the first and foremost important thing to remember is that dogs are not humans and their psychology is completely different. Something that works one way in the human world can have a drastic difference in the minds of dogs.

I can go on for days as of why I would not recommend the method displayed in OP's picture, but I'll try to keep it short. I once worked with a 7 year old German Shepard named Daisy. Daisy had two bad habits; she would bark at the door when someone would stand outside/attempt to enter, and she was also terrified of fireworks. As humans, when we see that someone we care about is afraid of something, we tend to nurture them and tell them that ""it's all going to be alright,"" etc. People do the exact same thing with their dogs when they seem scared or startled; they pet them and nurture them. The problem with this is the fact that what you're actually doing, despite of your good intentions, is encouraging their fear. Petting a dog is a form of encouragement and by petting them or nurturing them when their minds are in a scared state, you're actually feeding into the issue rather than helping it.

Now, back to Herbie. If Herbie has a fear of bypassers, then having them reward her state of mind is not what you'd want to do. You have to make sure (this is really important!) that you reward the right state of mind. Dogs live in the now; not yesterday or tomorrow. You have to make sure you can comprehend what state of mind your dog is in before you start rewarding them with treats. 

Those are just my two cents...Fence aggression is caused by the neglectful action of leaving dogs unattended outside in a yard. 

The dog sees a passerby and begins barking. 

The passerby has no reason to stop and engage the dog and so continues on their way. 

The dog associates the passerby leaving as their having driven them off.

This gets reinforced every time that a passerby transits the fence line.

The real solution is to actually TRAIN your dog to not ever bark at passerby by staying with them during the first TWO years of their life when outside to properly TRAIN them not to be an ANNOYING noise disturbance, NOT hand the responsibility over to strangers that don't want hear your dog BARKING at them, not to mention the neighbors, and be tasked with doing what YOU should be doing.

tl;dr It's your dog, you fucking train it.Herbie The Love DogBefore:
Bark bark bark (get away from my home!)

After:
Bark bark bark (give me treats!)From a veterinary student: Never punish a dog to treat fear. You would be pairing fear with fear which strengthens the initial fearful stimulus. Just wanted to say that first so people don't beat their dogs when they cower at fireworks. Now for the initial case, giving him treats when he barks at people he will bark more. He thinks ""whenever I bark I get treats"". So you reinforce the behavior. Unfortunately there is not a great way to treat this one if the owner isn't present because people ignoring the dog and walking by makes him think ""barking at people makes them leave"". And if this is his goal, the behavior has been reinforced. However the case with fireworks is a little different. This would be an example of counterconditioning. You should pair a positive stimulus with the fearful stimulus. So give treats and attention when fireworks happen. They realize when fireworks happen good things happen too.

[In December 2011, the Santa Clara City Council voted for an agreement that calls for the city’s Stadium Authority to borrow $850 million from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. This will cover most of the construction costs, with the remainder to be made up via funding from the NFL, a hotel tax and city redevelopment funds. Interest, fees and terms for this loan have not been disclosed.\[66\]\[67\] The $850 million building loan, plus interest and fees will be assumed by the City's Stadium Authority, where additional interest and fees will be applied. On February 2, 2012, NFL owners approved a loan to the 49ers of $200 million for use in constructing the new stadium, and to be taken from a new G-4 stadium loan fund.\[68\] Terms of the loan were not specified, but under the previous G-3 plan, money was repaid directly into the league's account from the borrowing team's share of gate receipts from road games.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium#Financing_and_construction)

I live in San Francisco and I don't remember it being too contentious of a subject, but the Bay Area in general is dealing with the effects of extreme income inequality and gentrification right now. 

Plus some feelings might have changed after the clusterfuck that was super bowl city. Very true.  My highschool burned down in 1998.  It took us almost six months to even get textbooks.  We had to eat in circus tent half the next year.  There was even a proposal of taking all our money, building a brand new school on the rich side of town, and then give us the old school they were currently using in the middle of town.  They didn't even start building the new school a month before I graduated in 2000 because the idea of building a modern school on the poorer side of town was so controversial.  Granted it did only take a year to build from that point.  But I only had a school for two out of four years because of politics.Because the type of company hired to build a stadium consists of proactive doers. The type of company hired to fix a school consists of lowest bidders.Levi Stadium: Field of Jeans Because you're in it(school) three quarters of the year.

Edited for those that needed help.> Why does it take a year to build a stadium

Because it doesn't. Taking a quick trip [over to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium), here are the key dates:

* 2007: Santa Clara starts working on project to build a stadium
* 2008: negotiations begin
* June 2009: agreement is made between 49ers team and city of Santa Clara
* December 2009: owners of Great America file lawsuit, which is dismissed
* June 2010: voters approve plan (Measure J).
* 2011: 49ers begin pre-sales of seats, boxes
* December 2011: Santa Clara secures funding
* February 2012: 49ers secure funding
* April 2012: groundbreaking at construction site
* July 2014: stadium opens

If you include everything, it basically took 7 years. Even if you forget all the planning and financing, construction itself took over 2 years, and obviously there would have been a lot of design work before that (probably going back to shortly after the Measure J approval).Maybe your school is full of vandals./r/ToMotivateYouBecause it took longer than 1 year to build Levis stadium.


>The official groundbreaking took place on April 19, 2012.

So the graffiti is a lie.


Not to mention school renovations and repairs are often scheduled around school days, so that education isn't interrupted by construction work. So generally there are major pushes to have everything in place for stages to begin and end over the summer months when students are out of school.Money is part of it - but also harder work. A hard-working owner/manager is chasing down the  contractors for any delays of his stadium - as a delay will lose him money. He will double check plans, call suppliers to make sure all is running smoothly etc. Your local bureaucrat is not putting in that extra effort for your school fixing/building./r/im14andthisisdeepGood question.

Why are we even considering spending money on a stadium when we've got school districts who have been unaccredited for more than a decade?""

We are pumping out entire generations of children who ""graduate"" from high school with a 2nd grade reading level, absolutely no marketable skills, no hope for the future, living in bad areas filled with violent crime, and we are worried about a stadium?

It's only a matter of time until things get much, much worse around here.  We've already let things go for FAR too long, but when the AP students in a school only have teachers in 3 of their 7 classes in a day, what hope do any of them have at having a real life?

We have got a lot of work to do and meanwhile the deeply, **DEEPLY** racist people around here are all scrambling to find another major league team to come and let us pay for a stadium for them.

It's obscene how passionate some people are for sports in this city versus how utterly ignorant or apathetic they are about these important issues.  A few miles of freeway isn't going to protect us all forever and eventually, ignoring a huge swath of our population and basically relegating them to a life of poverty with the white flight epidemic in this area is going to come back to bite us HARD.

And in the meantime, people are suffering.

""Miller Man"" Maquette of large sculpture for ITW Welded Steel with a marble base 24"" x 7"" x 7"" By David Madero - 

I first used a Spectrum 875 plasma cutter to cut out the initial design from a steel tube. I then used a Millermatic 252 to spot weld steel rods on the tube as a base for the texture and the welding man figure. I continued by welding the gaps and unions between the steel rods leaving a highly texturized surface.  I finished the process using a Diversion 180 tig welder to form puddles giving the hills and valleys appearance.

I always loved how John Wooden would write his wife a love letter every month even after she passed away. He would leave the letter on her pillow in a stack tied by a yellow ribbon. He also would not sleep on her side of the bed and never between the sheets once she passed. Two class acts. I'm a believer in Will being the greatest of all time, but Kareem was class all the way. Kept his mouth shut but was passionate and controlled. Learned a lot about life from Wooden.I met Kareem in Amsterdam in 2012! He was huge! Lemme see if I can find the picture.

It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.""

The baby—named Grace Kelly at the suggestion of a visiting nurse’s wife—was adopted by Carmen’s sister. The aunt also cares for Yoina, who shaved her head in mourning. But the sad events did not stop there. Soon after, Yoina’s pet tamarin was killed when it overturned a boiling pot on itself. The family buried it.

When our reporter Emma Marris went to Manú, she sought out Yoina. The girl still lives with her aunt and helps care for baby Grace. On that visit Yoina had less hair but a bit more of a smile, in gratitude for the gift of a photo with her pet.""By Charlie Hamilton James. He writes: Yoina aged nine with her pet saddle-back tamarin. Last year I was shooting an article for National Geographic Magazine on Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon. I had travelled deep into the park to a community called Yomibato, home to indigenous Machiguenga people (aka Matsigenka) as I wanted to look at how Manu’s indigenous people live within the world’s most bio-diverse national park. Every day Yoina and her friends would walk through our camp on the way to the river to swim. The monkey would come with her, even though it hated swimming. To escape the water the tamarin would always try to get onto Yoina’s head, where it felt more secure. Life for Yoina and the tamarin changed dramatically shortly after this image was taken. Their story and the story of Manu features in the June issue of National Geographic Magazine and on the NG website.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7mRg74qcY&feature=youtu.be) of this bitch in action.A gif of the little thing 

http://static.businessinsider.com/image/556cd32d69bedd3c21964422/image.gifv>While the device may look like a toy, it’s certainly not priced like one. The PD-100 Black Hornet 2 prices at about $40,000 for larger orders of the device, said Ole Aguirre, VP of business development for Prox Dynamics. But considering that the Pentagon plans to spend approximately $2.9 billion on unmanned systems for the fiscal year of 2016, according to the Drone Center at Bard College, the $40,000 price tag doesn’t seem so significant.

So in other words its a drop in the sieve.russia is ready: http://imgur.com/a83Ewgchttp://imhur.com/a/a1RHO6s.jpgI'm just happy that MiMS found a new job.There's more to that $40,000 package than just the PD-100 Black Hornet 2.  That case hanging off the guys chest houses the display and base station for it.

For what it's worth, it's not a bad little drone.  While it looks low tech it has 3 camera's, has a 2 mile range, can hit 22 mph and has a 25 minute flight time.  Perfect for the types of missions it's designed for, which primarily being spec ops missions, means it's not like they are going to buy so many of these that it dents the nearly $3B unmanned systems budget for next year.

EDIT:  Also worth noting, the British Army has already invested in these, and I believe the Australians have as well.  I also think that the drone itself is cheap and most of the money is in the ruggedized base station and software.  The company advertises the drone itself as ""Affordable - reusable and disposable"" which leads me to believe that replacing the drone itself is probably something more on the order of one of the CICADA systems drones, far cheaper than $40k.Should've waiting for the Black Friday deal. No army deals for Turkey day.This will get buried, but my idiot brother is the one holding the drone in this picture.  When I called him to tell him he made the front page of Reddit and was basically a celebrity, he responded with:  

""...  Cool...  What's Reddit?""Makes me wonder if they have Drones disguised as bugs now that they using to spy on people with. Hence why the Russians supposedly stop talking when they see a fly in the room.If the manufacturer sold more than 50 of them, the price probably would be closer to what we'd expect to pay ourselves. The Noisy Cricket. ""I feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing!""

Edit: Thank you for gilding my first ever comment.Haha... As much as I hate seeing expensive items on my property books that are cheaper in the civilian side... The prices on those items also reflect the entire package of service, maintenance, updates, repairs...

Ofc this varies between items, but for items sold to the government a lot of the expenses are passed directly into the govt because they will pay it. If a business provides something they need, the govt can always justify the cost of whatever the business says it had (eg it took me 400,000 dollars to make the tools to make this drone, I need to sell it to you for 40,000 to break even or make money on this since you're buying such a limited number of them) You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?Carbon fiber blades, gold plated axis, 4K live streaming camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, 2-40Hz microphone, ultrasound and infrared sensors, stealth absorption paint, facial recognition software with target auto detect and auto follow, satellite communication, radar jammer, micro laser canyon, stun/freeze ray, not to mention that the contractor, designers and builders need to pass FBI background checks and DoD clearance so it all adds up to US$45,392.13 - Bald Eagle Freedom discount of US$5,392.13 = US$40,000.00.

It was one of the most surreal moments of my youth. the second photo captures just about everyone's reaction they would have if they just finished a tough climb and the skyline fucking exploded. I live in Washington and remember that day well. I was 13 years old. Myself and a friend had ridden our bikes a couple miles from home to go shoot our BB guns. We had gotten to our destination, taken a few shots, and saw some big dark clouds in the distance. Really big. Really dark. It looked like rain clouds so we started racing home trying to beat the downpour that we thought was coming. A couple minutes later the clouds caught up to us and it started snowing. Well, it looked like snow, but it was ash.  We couldn't really see very well by this point and it was getting pretty uncomfortable to breathe. We saw some headlights coming down the road and it was basically pitch dark at this point. The headlights stopped revealing a truck and the driver yelled at us to throw our bikes in the back and he would take us home. I remember we had been reading in school about Hiroshima and nuclear bombs, and I was pretty sure we had been nuked. The driver told us that ""Mount St. Helen's just blew up"" and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about but hearing the words ""blew up"" reinforced in my head that this was a nuclear war...or the start of one. Got home and saw the news.

That is how I found out that we have volcanoes in Washington and that I wasn't witnessing the start of World War 3.""Well, it's a good thing we didn't climb that one today.""I would just like to point out that in these pictures, Mt. St. Helens is 34 miles away. There had to have been some type of sonic boom that was out of this world seconds after they noticed the eruptionEven more intense are the [last photos from Robert Landsburg](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/234721-robert-landsburgs-brave-final-shots). 

""When the mountain exploded, he already had his camera on a tripod, aimed and cocked. As the all-engulfing cloud of ash climbed the sky toward him, four miles from the summit, he desperately cranked frames by frames across his lens, then rewound the film into its cassette inside the camera, wrenched the camera from its tripod, and stowed it in his backpack. His wallet was in the backpack too — perhaps to assure future identification.

Seventeen days later, his body was found in the ash, together with the film that cost him his life. It contained not only telling images of the killing edge of the blast but also the scratches, bubbles, warping, and light leaks caused by heat and ash, the very thumbprint of the holocaust.""I lived about 120 miles north, up in Snohomish, when it blew. Most of the ash ended up in Eastern Washington. [It turned day into night over there.](http://ecologicalsociology.blogspot.com/2010/05/it-was-30-years-ago-today.html)

edit: link My aunt and uncle struggled through the Great Depression then worked hard their entire lives. Finally they retired and built their dream retirement house on the banks of a river than flows from Mt. Saint Helens. Only a couple of months after moving in the mountain blew and they made it out with their lives with minutes to spare. Lost everything they owned except what they were wearing. Luckily their daughter had married a very rich guy and could take them in. But they never really recovered from the shock and died within a year or two after. I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time, and all I remember is that shit just about knocked me out of bed. Incredible BANG that shook the whole house, particularly my bedroom window. I hiked around Mt. Saint Helens in 1996, the side of the mountain that exploded was nuts.  There were areas where we were walking across fields of 1/2-inch round pumice that was deeper than you could dig, and then you would walk around a corner and be back in the forest for another few hundred yards, and then you would hit a line and back to the pumice field.  It was probably as close to walking on the moon as you can get without actually walking on the moon.  One of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.I watched it from our garage door about 30 miles to the upper left of this picture (meadow glade WA). Could never wrap my head around people selling the pens with ash in them...we could have made millions!Found this guy when reading up about this picture, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Randall_TrumanAny time I see Mt. Saint Helens photos I'm always reminded of Crater Lake (for obvious reasons). The crazy part is that native tribes were in the region when Mt. Mazama blew up to eventually become what we know as [Crater Lake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Crater_lake_oregon.jpg). Mt. Saint Helens was a huge deal even with the geology and volcano knowledge we have today. I can't imagine what had to be racing through their minds when Mt. Mazama erupted.

""Prior to its climactic eruption Mount Mazama had a summit elevation of about 3,700 m (12,000 ft). The present high point is Mount Scott at 2,721 m (8929 ft), 3 km (about 2 mi) east of the caldera rim. Today, the caldera rim ranges in elevation from approximately 2,040 m (6,700 ft) to 2,484 m (8,150 ft)""
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/crater_lake/crater_lake_geo_hist_133.htmlwhoa. thats terrifying. As a climber, theres always this thought in the back of your mind when you climb a volcano (even a dormant one) that it *could* erupt regardless of how incredibly unlikely that event is. Seeing this must have been a mix of emotions, awe, terror, dread, wonder, and concern for any one effected. 

Also, i'm 100% certain that those climbers were now facing extreme difficulty in returning to Seattle or Portland and were likely in danger from transportation/ash related problems. This is incredible. I don't think there's anything else to do at a moment like that except watch in awe.I was in Seattle when it blew and we all heard it. My dad and I flew from Seattle to California a couple hours later, and they changed our flight plan to go around it. I was a kid and didn't quite get the significance of what I was seeing, but my dad was jumping around in excitement climbing over people to get photos. He was a medical dr but his hobbies were geology and mineral collecting. (the mineral collection he spent his life collecting was donated to the Geology Department at UCLA and is in display cases lining the hallways of the geology building , if anyone is interested. Anyway, I think the guy in the window seat thought my dad was going to climb in his lap Would you stand and watch or run like heckDid they survive?If you're ever in the area be sure to visit Mt. St. Helens.

The thing that always perplexed me about these ""women's magazines"" (and Woman's World is probably the most guilty of this): Almost every single issue, there are two big things on the cover: ""Make these delicious treats!"" and ""Tricks / Diets to lose weight fast!""

Seriously, take a look the next time you're in the store. 99% of the time you'll find the cover of Woman's World has both of those. It's so absurd.Magazine aimed at single woman: Get skinny fast!  How to get him off!

Magazine aimed at married woman: Bake this incredibly unhealthy cake!  How to lose 20 lbs!
Marketer here.

You aren't their target audience. 

These magazines do TONS of market research or ""testing"" behind the scenes. They interview dozens upon dozens of people behind closed doors and ask them random questions. A lot of the answers given may seem bullshit to us, but market research is about picking up on the ""language"" that your target audience uses today. Hence, you see a difference in the way weight loss is described in the latter version. Same thing, but their target audience now describes their pain points in a different lingo. 

I bet this magazine conducted hundreds of interviews and picked up on pain points, the way their readers think and talk, how they describe situations, etc before they even released this cover.

It's actually SUPER easy to conduct market/customer/user research now. In the past, companies had to do in person interviews and focus groups in order to understand their target audience. That would take WEEKS to organize and conduct... Super slow process and quite frankly, dreadful. Now they go to companies like UserTesting and launch a quick, remote test and within 20 minutes have all the research they need. 

Crazy world we live in!

At the arena in my city, draft beer is $8 or $12 depending on size. $15 no, but not far off. 

Beer is always overpriced at arenas and stadiums. Wow! Only $7.00 for a Bud Light!You paid $3000/ticket to get in. A $15 beer should be chump change to you.

I sure as hell hope that wall was designed to take the load and the rocks are supported to the lathe well.  Otherwise that thing is going to last 5-10 years tops.What exactly is used to hold the rocks in place...a certain kind of cement?In the boy scouts, they would warn us against using river rocks for our fire pit. I was told they can explode.This is by [Michael Eckerman](http://www.eckermanstudios.com/), [Here](https://www.pinterest.com/stacycats36/michael-eckerman-stone/) is some more of his stone work.The idea and execution are both really great, but the scale isn't good. It really overwhelms the house instead of fitting in and seeming like a part of it. Same thing but smaller would have been perfect.ITT: People who know about river rocks but not about fireplace/chimney construction. River rock is often used for fireplace surrounds and is easily found at many local landscape and decor specialty stores. The stones are not used directly in the fireplace where the heat is the highest. In addition, many stones are properly dried before being sold. 

They aren't wrong saying you shouldn't use river rock when making a camping fire. But, in this application, river rocks are completely fine and make for an aesthetically pleasing fireplace. It doesn't really matter what kind of stone it is as far as resisting heat.

Unless this was built some place that is completely wild west as far as building codes, this isn't a chimney and fireplace that is solely stone. There is a fireplace made out of fire brick and a specific heat resistant mortar. 

That feeds up into a smoke shelf which will be masonary and on top of that will be clay liners, wrapped in four inch block all the way up. There will also be four inch block providing the rectangular shape to lay the stone up to.

To sum it up: There is a clay liner that's an inch or more thick, a four inch block, at least an inch or two of space, then the four inch block exterior shell, another inch or two between the shell and the stone.

These stone are at least almost a foot away (with close to nine inches of heat resistant material in between) from any of that heat being produced in the fireplace and moving up and out through the chimney.and now there is a river with no rocks I admire the amount of technical skill and time put into this, but I think it looks really tacky. Nice idea, but the design make nauseous. I need order, sorry.Former mason laborer here - by far the funnest job I worked on was a huge entire house of irregular stone like this.  Basically it was a 2-month-long scavenger hunt, running from skid to skid looking for the right stone for the right spot.  Took longer and the rocks were harder to lift, but man it was a nice break from the monotony of brick-work.  And looked awesome when we were done!Nope. Sorry but it reminds me of the picture of the ticks in a dog's ear. I can't unsee that picture when I look at this chimney. I saw a picture once of a deer with hundreds of ticks in a group stuck to it and it looks like this fire placelooks amazing but how long do these actually last? the mortar will give way to weather and the rocks will fall out of place eventuallyi wonder what there is to stop rain from just falling right down and into your house.Looks like a hidden environmental puzzle from The Witness.These curves bother me. I like things that are square. I would be climbing that, in my childhood.Goddamn that's beautiful.

I need to know. For reasons. Please.This is a lot like Greg Klassen's tables in wood and glass. I think Klassen's work is, overall, nicer looking though. It also involves more work to cut the glass to match the curves:

It was in the early to mid 1990s in Riverside California. I was standing outside of a backyard party ($3 at the gate). I think the Voodoo Glow Skulls or the Assorted Jelly Beans or Schlong or some other stupidly-named band was going to play. 

So I was outside I was,  waiting for some friends when from down the street came a slow moving car with a search light. Pandemonium broke out because the party was about to be busted. Shouts of ""five-oh! five-oh!"" were heard. People took off in every direction. They jumped over the back fences. I even heard someone tried to put the keg in the washing machine. 

So I'm out there and I'm afraid of nothing because I'm straight and I don't have pockets full of marijuana or speed. 

Slowly, slowly, the car comes up shining the spotlight.

This glaring error upsets me more than it should. My car wouldn't start. So I took it to my Ford dealership because I had 150$ credit. They said it was my battery. I paid 100$ for it because it had a long ass warranty and I was like fuck it. Next day it didn't start again. They said it was my alternator and it would cost 700$. I told them that is insane and hung up. They called back and said they talked to their manager and took 5% off. I laughed and hung up.

I installed the alternator myself for total of 120$ and 30Min to an hour of work. This being my first time looking at youtube videos.

Turns out that wasn't it.

I took it to a mom and pop shop and they fixed it in 4ish hours (dropped it off before work)for 100$ total and said the air condition was drawing power.

The Ford dealership makes money on commission. My theory was they were going to claim it was the alternator and charge me 200-300% overcharge and then fix the air conditioning problem and claim it was the alternator.

Fuck those crooks.Not bad. At the dealership I get my car serviced at they tried to hit me up for $1,900 in bullshit. All I needed was a 25k mile service. I thought out loud and asked him ""are you fucking serious?"". I could see the terror in his eyes and that's worth more than any gift card.Now come get your air filter so we can sell you something else and charge you up on labor to make up for the gift cards.Wow!

Someone educate me... what are the balloon-looking things?  Or are they bombs?  My Dad is somewhere in there. My grandfather was a medic on D-day. He dragged wounded and dead soldiers to the beach and loaded them onto medic boats. I'm going to see him in an hour and I didn't realize what today is until I saw this post. Thank you for reminding me to thank him. Probably the most insane logistical and engineering undertaking in history.an interesting thing about d day is the germans blew up all the docks and the allies anticipated this and build a floating dock that they could boat up to the beach which then served as a unloading point for all their shit... and the germans blew up their shit and the allies sailed their dock in and everything went way easier for the unloading process... it was called mulberry and when i saw this on the history channel the guy said it was one of the most innovative things about the invasionImagine what that must have *sounded* like.Might get buried, but I'm pretty sure that boat 2nd from the left was my grandfather's ship.  LST 309.  Crazy to think he is in the photo somewhereIn *The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant*, which may be the finest memoirs ever by a U.S. President, Grant devotes many chapters to the Mexican-American War and the U.S. Civil War. This is no surprise. However, to those unfamiliar with the text, it often comes as a surprise how much attention Grant devotes to *logistics*.  In popular imagining, new technologies like machine guns were decisive in the Civil War, but from the point of view of America's top general, such things weren't even worth mentioning. Victory resulted from being able to move his cannons and food to where he wanted them to be.[Meanwhile, back in America](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7493/15944038808_a049f08ec3_h.jpg)[deleted]
""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""

James doohanThis is an incredible and amazing photo.  Reading about the landings and that day and the horror of just the one battle, it's a mind blowing thought to me that as safe as these particular soldiers must have felt, they were just getting started with the war.

I can't comprehend how mentally taxing battle must have been.  If you survive, you know there's more coming.  In Stephen Ambrose's book ""D-Day,"" which I highly recommend, he compares the D-Day landings to taking every man, woman, child, vehicle, and supply in Green Bay, Wisconsin—everything in the entire city not bolted down—and moving it across Lake Michigan in 24 hours while under constant fire.Where are all those metal things that you usually see in movies depicting D-day. I think they're called hedgehogs? I thought they were there to prevent lots of vehicles landing on the beach. ""You know those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got?

It was before the Bears match yesterday[OP right after taking this picture](http://media.giphy.com/media/vJKeu2upniCSk/giphy.gif).Stealth - 11/10 

IGNI *just* finished two hours of reading about the development of the stealth bomber.  TIL:  That a scale model was made with the functional RCS technique and placed atop a $186,000 pole to make it high enough to fire radar at it.  When the radar returned only a blip for the pole, the operator sent guys to put the plane back on top, as it has clearly fallen off.  It had not.  

BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ALL 'MURICA. 

Unsatisfied, apparently, with seeing the blip of the pole...they ordered the design and construction of *a new pole made with stealth capabilities.*  They made an effin stealth *pole.*  No info on how many workers died running into it while setting it up.

Bonus TIL:  1)Stealth bombers were the first planes ever designed by a team lead by the electrical engineer.  2)When designing the shape of the plane, they created software to test for the desired effect on radar systems.  They were unable to even consider panels that were curved, as the the computers running the test algorithms would still be working on the results *today,* which is why they are flat.  This design and the total lack of traditional aerodynamics led to it being nicknamed Hopeless Diamond.  This could have so easily been photo shopped and I wouldn't even be mad if it was.Where was this taken?For all who say they need proof, this is as much as I can do, [the next shot](http://i.imgur.com/RNxF7re.jpg) in the HDR burst.

Seven hued shells, and the rooster will become a god.Each one has a different power-up right?[For anyone curious](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/why_are_chicken_eggs_different_colors) about why chicken eggs come in different colors. Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

>All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hen’s oviduct. The journey through the chicken’s oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg.Wow, it's a very artistic photograph :DCould you possibly post a picture of each hen showing which egg is hers? That would be cool to see.Banjo Kazooie!hen partyI've seen every single one of those from my mother's hens.

If anyone wants to see the rest of the pictures of this National Geographic story shot by Wayne Lawrence.I used to live in Flint, and these are the most well-dressed kids I've ever seen in this town. Private school? 
As a quick aside, I'm begging you all not to forget about Flint. This town has been getting screwed for decades, and people are finally paying attention. Keep pressing the issue, because the people responsible for this need to be held accountable. No slaps on the wrist this time. ""Back in 2016 I had to carry bottled water 5 miles uphill in the snow!""As shitty as the situation is little man looks sharp in the uniform.Fun story. I lived in Detroit for a summer in a house with no pipes and no electricity. It had been completely gutted. So no water, no working toilets, etc. It was pretty crazy but I grew up poor so it didn't feel as bad to me as it would for other people.

Background: my dad bought this house for hella cheap and moved out there. He knew what he was getting himself into and had plans to just rough it while he saved up to have the pipes re-installed, toilets and sinks and faucets replaced and get everything in working order. That never happened though. Life throws curve balls at us all the time. 

The summer of 2010, I went to stay with him since it was summer vacation from college. 

There was a lot of craftiness involved in living there. Being on my period was the worst. 

My brother (also lived there) and I would walk to the local library and brush our teeth there. We would stay from open until about 3 or 4pm and read and charge our phones. We were also able to use flushing toilets there. At home, we shat in plastic bags and then threw them away outside (tmi?) 

We were also able to get gallons of water at the store to bathe with. We would put water in little tin things (like for cooking bbq and stuff) and then use bar soap. We weren't the cleanest people but we weren't hella funky either.

My dad did splurge once when I was on my period and got me a room in a hotel so I could clean up properly. I was also able to wash my hair at the hotel which was nice. 

We didn't have electricity either. My dad and I slept on the floor in his room (brother was upstairs) and one day we went to RadioShack and bought a crank radio. We would listen to our favorite radio show at night. It was really nice. The sun set pretty late so we had a good amount of daylight to get stuff done. Whenever I would get home from the library, I would usually write or draw.

We ate a lot of fruit and bread and random snacks because we couldn't cook. My dad and brother also ate canned meats. 

It was a summer I'll never forget. It was actually one of my favorite summers in spite of everything. I knew that when I went back to school, I was going to miss Detroit. It's not the friendliest city in the world but for some reason the part I was in (the east side) felt kind of like the country to me. Things felt slower, homier, more neighbohood-y. It's hard to explain. But as much shit as people have to say about Detroit, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Most people don't know I've lived like this and wouldn't expect it. I'm kind of prim and proper at times and I'm about to get a master's degree. People with master's degrees don't shit in plastic bags!Gm refused to use it because it was corroding car parts...people expect flint residents to bathe in it?

Hhmm make it black and white and we are back to 1940 Maybe this is why we think old pictures looks so different. Because these are the photos that make it to the future. People in 2060 are going to think the same thing we're thinking now!Is this for showers, dish washing etc. as well?Stop commenting how much water that is for drinking. 

You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. That's a quarter bottle, per person, at least. You make your coffee. Two bottles. You drink it and wash your cup. That's at least a bottle of water to do that. Of course if you ate breakfast and your family ate too, you have to wash those, so bet on 10 bottles to do your dishes. You can take a shower, but the water is sort of blue today, which means the copper hasn't cleared the lines, and you broke out yesterday, so you just wipe up with a washrag. That's half a bottle. Per person. Minimum. If you need to wash your hair, that's an an additional 2-5 bottles, if you have long hair. 

You need to wipe down the counters, but you don't want to wipe lead onto them, so you use bottled water to clean up with, that's a bottle or 2. You water the dog, 2 bottles. THroughout all this, you've probably been sipping on a water bottle. 

You make spaghetti for dinner, that means 4 bottles for water for cooking, plus 10-12 bottles to wash out that many greasy pots and pans and rinse them, and you still have to wash everyone up for bed and get their teeth brushed, which is at least another three quarters of a bottle per person. 

Stop thinking of it as the drinking water allowance for the day. It's the only clean, safe, usable water in your home that can be used for anything but flushing your toilet, for the next 24 hours. Is that just *their* allowance or for the whole family? And wouldn't it be more efficient to distribute the water in gallon jugs?[Source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160209-flint-michigan-portraits-photography-lead/)please credit the god damn photographer.

Pardon my language and this isn't meant personally toward anyone but as someone from Flint, MI I say this:  Fuck off with using us as ""the state of America"" and all that.  Every 10 years we end up in the news for some ""look how the system has failed"" story and every time people act like they finally realize something needs to change.  None of you care in the bigger picture of it all.  A year or more down the road and you will have forgotten all about this and Flint will still be decayed and run down and left a shell of a city.  As shitty as this current situation is, it's been within a hair of this for DECADES.  This is just an interesting headline to the rest of the nation until it isn't any more.I apologize if this is not the appropriate place to post this, but I feel it may be useful since it's a highly visible post right now.

We are a band from Flint, MI (I currently live right downtown) called Sprowt.

Several bands, some from Flint and some outside of Flint, have contributed music to a $5 compilation album organized by Jonathan Diener (of The Swellers). 

100% of the proceeds are being donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint's Flint Child Health & Development Fund (flintkids.org).

If you're a music fan, please feel free to donate by buying the Not Safe To Drink: Music For Flint Water Crisis Relief compilation album at:

https://notsafetodrink.bandcamp.com/

The compilation album will be available on February 20th, 2016.

Thank you to everyone taking notice and doing something to help.

Put quite frankly, this whole thing sucks.Where can I donate?I can't imagine what I'd do if my kids had been permanently poisoned with lead. I'd go on a rampage.Flint is a disaster.  There's literally no quick fix and one that won't cost a huge amount of money.  Flint needs to be condemned and the residents should have their homes bought out at a fair market price before the crisis occurred.  100,000 residents + a quick google search showing that the average house price ~$100k = $10bn to buy out Flint. Probably a bit more than that, but in the ball park.  Shit, we spend way more to drop bombs on people in foreign lands every year.  I'm sure we can help 100,000 Americans out.

Also, more info on [Lichtenberg figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure)! This may sound obvious, but if you see something like that happening, don't go near it. There's other people in this thread who said that, but I'm not sure if everyone knows the reason why. It's not just because the person telling you to stay away thinks you're stupid and going to accidentally touch the line. Being near the line can kill you, you don't have to actually touch the line to die. 

An energized wire on the ground causes something called ""step potential"". Basically, the voltage in the ground is high near the wire, and decreases the farther away from the wire you get. If your feet are apart, the voltage between your feet can cause a current to travel through your body. Maybe it'll injure you, maybe it'll kill you. If you need to get away from something like this, shuffle away with your feet together. They used to tell us you could also hop with your feet together, but I guess they don't trust us not fall over, because that would also probably kill you. 

tl;dr: Just being near a burning wire like this can kill you, even without actually touching it.[Who wants a body massage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3GTNv9hHk)It's the Sha from WoW! Except real!I have had the experience of watching a high voltage line fall to the ground and arc several times after a rain storm. I was about 200' away when it fell. The sound, heat, and brilliant light was truly a thing to behold. The sound is a tortured and macabre screed in the most evil tone you've ever heard. The heat and light are incredibly intense. Unfortunately the sound drew my eyes directly to the fireball and it left an after image the persisted for several minutes. 

These underground vault fires are something special too. I have watched an attempt to put these out before. As I recall, it took this massive truck pumping insane quantities of CO2 into the vault to chill it before anyone could enter. 

http://youtu.be/0_jLmAB3leAReal Question: Shouldn't this wire be insulated?ShockingFractals. Crazy how they pop up over and over.Lineman here, can confirm, stay away. People,  voltage won't kill you, amperage will. The resistance of the ground changes everywhere, that's the reason for the lighting bolt pattern. What's cool is that along where the wire was on the ground (directly beneath the wire) it'll make crude glass, which looks pretty bad ass. 
Safety: NEVER touch a down wire. We are protected by step/touch potential by rubber over shoes gloves and sleeves, even then we still verify that the wire is de-energized before we touch it. Keep in mind de-energized does not mean that it's safe to touch. Had a worker bump a line with his leg that was down and de-energized but not properly grounded, didn't have his boots on because they were In a marsh and he got killed. Induced voltage from another line. If a wire is on the ground think of it as a bear or wolf, you get to close and it's going to maim and more often than not kill you... 

TL/DR: Never touch a wire on the ground, fear that shit like it's got a gun to your head. That's fracted up.Sha-touched groundA similar pattern grew on a CD I left in my car for over a year:

What are we talking- $40 each?  $50 maybe?The sanding...oh god, the sanding...TIL: *Brown Oak is technically not a distinct species of oak, but rather refers to oak (almost always English Oak or another European species) that has been infected with a fungus. This fungus (Fistulina hepatica) has the effect of turning the wood a deep brown color. Once the wood has been cut and dried, the fungus dies, leaving a rich golden brown lumber.*

English Oak (assuming that's what this is) looks to have tighter grain than the Red Oak I'm used to in Virginia.That's awesome.

for [Little Rubio!](http://i.imgur.com/dVD7yiu.png)Stunning work of art, it belongs in a museum.  What a gifted craftsman.It's beautiful but somehow repulsive.The craftsman that made this chair was 78 years old. It was the last piece of furniture his boss Tom told him to make. It took him a year and a half to complete.

 As he worked his hands hurt and he felt tired. At times he wanted to cut corners and go home early. But did he? No, he worked harder and more diligently than ever. The sweat boiled from his face as he toiled. Final he was done.

 He showed the chair to his boss the next morning. ""Jim this is the finest work you have ever done."" His boss was very pleased. ""Why did you work on it so hard Jim?""

 ""Because the customer who buys this will live with it for a lifetime."" ""Through good times and bad, through all the seasons and all Hollidays. Memories will be made. Memories maybe I didn't get to make myself."" 

Tom looks at Jim and with a tear in his eye and says ""The chair is yours Jim."" ""The chair is yours Jim....."" ""It didn't take that long, considering I carved all by hand and from a single piece of wood.""That is a lot of work on a very unstable piece of wood. I hope it's kept in a very stable environment.I suppose everyone has different tastes, but this is butt ugly to me.  Tremendous amount of work and considerable skill displayed, but not something I'd have.The sanding...oh god, the sanding...Ron Swanson would be proud... though he could have done that in one evening after drinking a pint of whiskey.TRUMP 2016!!!

Please downvote me!!!Sorry but it reminds me of the nails of the guy who holds the guiness world record for the longest nails.That's glorious!  Thank you for sharing!I was also carved from an oak stump. Excellent showcase of skill.I once made a pinewood derby car.

From a kit.Gorgeous work. Thanks for sharing. I don't know why some are so worried about how big or comfortable it would be.

So many memories going up there each summer.I wonder how many people were conceived there.I find it interesting that the only place the forest made inroads is right up by the screen.  My guess is that the fanned out area where cars used to park to see the movie is somewhat contaminated from oil and exhaust from cars, making that ground less fertile.  In fact, I see that bushes are growing in the car-park area, but in distinct lines, probably where cars didn't park or drive.

Americans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.  But I think in many cases a revolution just replaces the current bad players with a possible set of worse players. 

I'd love to see a history of overthrown governments and whether the common people were better or worse off after it.

Thanks for sharing!Photo by [Frank White Bull](http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/198392/)Time to call Sam and DeanI grew up in the Chicago area, but lived in Mitchell, SD for a year. As much as I thought we had it bad for weather, SD was just ridiculous. It gets hotter in the summer, colder in the winter, and the storms (winter and summer) are wilder. Snow plows running every week, signs getting blown off buildings, flickering lights, snowing in October and May, rain clouds that looked like armageddon. They were beautiful, though. Like the people from Independence Day looking up at those ships in awe as the beam gradually forms and decimates everything.As a South Dakotan I love whenever my state gets some attention everyone from there likes to jump in and chime Oooh Im from South Dakota! We are an awesome little big state.I like the look of the photo, but I wonder how green that really is because I have seen skies that have that eerie sea green that I just know hail is coming my way.  The midwest is a terrifyingly beautiful part of America.I have experienced one of these South Dakota summer storms, probably around about this time of year, too. We were camping in Badlands NP. Temps had reached 116 that day, too hot and humid to move. That night, the bellowing wind bent the tent sideways; after we'd held it up from the inside for what seemed like an hour, we made a run for the car, sleeping bags in tow. From there we were witness to an almighty thunderstorm, lightning striking all over the visible sky, as a backdrop of 80s rock songs played on the car radio. The storm finally passed around 6am, and we returned wearily to our tent, which had somehow survived. It was terrifying at the time, but made for an amazing adventure for two Brits not used to such monumental storms! We loved our time in and around the Black Hills.*What a glorious day!*Yay! More comments/upvotes here than people who actually live in South Dakota with me!

CEDAR FALLS (KWWL) -
The University of Northern Iowa Police Department are asking for your help for information regarding the whereabouts of Adam Sailor.

>Sailor was expected to participate in commencement ceremonies today but failed to attend.

>He is around 5’ 9” tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

>If you have information regarding Sailor or where he is located please call UNI Police Department immediately. 

>UNI Police Department: 319-273-2712Wait why was she flying in? Graduation is only a few days after finalsThanks for David Johnson!Fellow native Iowan here, glad to see my home state on the front page for some reason other than the primaries...This is why you can't say *all* of the education system in America is bad.ITT: Iowans getting stoked about finding other Iowans on Reddit.

Note: I too am from Iowa. I've been in the UNIdome many times. 
UNI is great - I just finished up my first year, and I love it. From the administration to students, it feels very tight-knit. I have the opportunity to work with administrators, and they genuinely care about students. Once in a while the president (Bill Ruud, at the left podium) will just wander around the union and talk to people, he invited student government to his house. A couple weeks ago the Provost (Jim Wohlpart, on the right podium) came to one of the student senate meetings, and we had a great discussion with him. 

And he signs his emails with an interesting signature, ""Awe & Wonder"".
Honestly that really considerate of them.

At my graduation the women's lacrosse team was away at some championship game and came two hours late, and the faculty tried to make everyone stay. People were getting restless and tried to leave but they would get up and tell the students that it was mandatory to stay. 

Eventually they got there, instead of lining up and getting their diplomas they wanted their names called one by one so they could make a grand entrance and high-five people. They got booed instantly.Is the ceremony so important? I mean... I'm in Europe, but when my graduation ceremony was organized I had already moved to another city and started working, so I just declined the invitation. 

It's just an event, as far as I know :3Was surprised seeing UNI on Reddit... I completed my Master's there. I never thought I'd end up in Iowa, but can't think of a bad thing to say about UNI or Cedar Falls.

Except the -40 degree wind chills. Fuck those.Isn't UNI the school that gave us The Interlude dance a few years back?  
God bless that campus. /r/iowa

Kamerick is my grand dad.I challenge *anyone* to name a group of people nicer than the god damn Iowans! UNI is a stand up university. Wow!

I'm confused on the internet when people say uni short for university. Graduate as of today, go Panthers! Incredibly professional.  

I feel  like my Alma Mater would have found a way to charge me money or withhold my degree for missing mine.UNI Fight!Wow reading the title I thought maybe they delayed the graduation for 45 minutes and I was like wow that's very nice, but I feel the pain for the audience having sat through a lot of graduations myself. They are very long and grueling for the audience. Although they stayed 45 minutes AFTER the whole ceremony huge props to them. That's insane. Am I crazy or is 45 minutes not that long to wait?

It's odd when you stumble across a place you recognize IRL on reddit. 
I'm friends with your neighbor and have seen that view many times.

 I was wondering who bought that place. Great job on the renovation!Did a girl move in?So is there an Eames chair hiding behind the Eames footrest?That is one amazing maximization of living space. Way to open it up. Looks fantastic.Love the stairs. Where did you get them?

My guess is that your local building code won't accept the open nature of the stairs on one side -- because of the possibility of falls.Some Feeney cable rail would look great on those stairs for the right side handrail. http://www.feeneyinc.com/
Not the cheapest but really nice. I like everything but the new couch. The old one looks so damn comfyWhat's upstairs? It's like...you became an adult. Nice! Do anything professionally or is this from YouTube learning?Went from a cool place to hang out at to a place you have to hold your farts in for long uncomfortable periods of time.Replacing that stair case was money well spent. I feel like the right wall needs to be red or some other accent color. Great renovation.What an incredible transformation! What part do you like best about your new place? Also, what kind of set up do you have? A studio? Or is it something more?Thats a pretty neat carpet design whered you find it?You people are crazy, or all in on a joke or something. 

Dirty carpet, ugly furniture, old ugly kitchen cabinets, cramped kitchen, all fixed and improved. Very good job, OP.I love the new stairs.  It really opened up the space.I'm surprised by how many people prefer the before. The only thing that I would see as a downgrade is the couch. On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Even though I'm only in my early-30s, plenty of Redditors are younger than that. The before reminds me of my first apartment, the second reminds me of what I upgraded into. So well done OP, welcome to adult-hood. Young redditors, you'll be there soon.

* I'll take hardwood over carpet, every day of the fucking week.
* Opening up the kitchen pass-through into the dining-area is great.
* Using ceiling mounted lighting over the dining area table instead of a floor mounted is great as well. 
* That arcade took up too much space for the area (IMO), good job placing it elsewhere. 
* Many other improvementsLooks great. I like how you swapped out the laminate for some foot friendly carpet. The gaming arcade and well stocked central bar are also nice touches! Very 80's.It is amazing

what throwing out old beer cans

can do for value.Based on the lighting, I'd say there's a window behind where the picture was taken.

It makes those binoculars on the table seem a little bit creepy.I can totally picture myself falling off those stairs... face first.

I played paintball with a previous boss who showed up in a ghillie suit. We made fun of him, at first.

This fucking guy layed down in the patchiest, dirtiest piece of land and pinned us down. 4 of us could not find him. We KNEW here was there because the goddamn grass kept shooting at us. But we couldn't figure out which patch of grass it was, or what part of that patch was him. 

It's important to know this guy was 250 - 300 lbs. Not an inconspicuous dude. Completely invisible to 4 adults looking for a guy in this suit 25 feet away. Un fucking real.Storytime: Years ago, when I was in the newspaper business, I was at a house covering a standoff. A fellow journalist and I were standing outside chatting for about an hour.

He didn't want us messing with it, but every now and then when he was away, I'd sneak it down from the attic and play spy. I did this all through middle school, hiding in bushes and fields, trying to see how close I could get to people without them noticing.

One time I was trying to sneak up on a small herd of deer that were hanging around in a field by the highway. I got really close, when suddenly this car pulls over, and the driver gets out. He slammed his door, which scared the deer away. :(

He also apparently pulled over to take a leak, and thought the small grassy outcropping was a good target to piss on. I was a good spy. I never compromised my position.I completely missed the other two snipers in the background.This reminds me of a time I had a sleepover with a friend who insisted to stay the night.  We stayed up late playing call of duty 4 and he kept getting frustrated saying ""I fucking hate wookies.  I don't want to play Star Wars.""   

He was complaining about the snipers in their ghillies and also refrained from telling me that prior to our sleepover, he had ingested quite a bit of hallucinogens.

Stick with Link3, it really is the best.Fun fact, the French government allows tax relief to shepherds who voluntarily provide and maintain sheep on plots of land that are believed to have a number of undetonated mines. The idea is that without putting human lives at risk, sheep can detonate landmines over time while the owner of the sheep is compensated for the possibility of losing said sheepIt is absolutely mind boggling the scales of WW1 and WW2. I have traveled around much of Europe and South East Asia, retracing troop movements and big battles. Some of the places seem like it just took place in the past decade. The sheer size of these wars are just simply unimaginable. Reminds me of the final episode of Blackadder :'-(That is beautiful, but also quite eye opening.  I imagine you could spend an afternoon digging around in there, and you are pretty much guaranteed to find some soil.Ah yes, the trenches of Beaumont-Hamel. The 1st Royal Newfoundland Regiment's probably more well known battles. July 1st, 9:15am, of the 780 men, all from the 1RNR involved in the 3rd wave of attacks (all attacks before completely failed), only 110 survived, and only 68 were available for roll call next morning. This picture is just East of the Caribou Memorial for the 1RNR. By the looks of the craters this was a German trench because a week before the charge, the Allies bombarded the German line with artillery and mortar. Unfortunately it did not weaken their defenses.[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont-Hamel_Newfoundland_Memorial) is the story of this trench.Some scars never heal completely[deleted]Were the trenches originally straight and they have eroded over time, or were they dug like that? If the landmines are all gone, that would be one hell of a playground.Considering the fronts weren't moving much and it was essentially feeding meat into a grinder from both sides ... just imagine how many people died in that picture alone over those 4 years. :/[Welcome to the lovely Cercen Pass.]  (http://i.imgur.com/mLSXLBt.jpg)  Where you can still find many remnants of the oft-forgotten Frozen War of the Alps.

The Italians established many gun positions and camps [on mountaintops like these.](http://i.imgur.com/JSCO29y.jpg)

The Austria efforts were equally Sisyphean.  [On Marmolada, the highest mountain in the Dolomites,](http://i.imgur.com/n88KSic.jpg) the Austrian Corps of Engineers built an entire ""ice city""—a complex of tunnels, dormitories, and [storerooms dug out of the bowels of the glacier.](http://i.imgur.com/Iu2H7gM.jpg)  Only to lose it to the Italians.  Who in turn lost it the next winter to the combined Austrian/German forces.  In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

.

We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie

In Flanders fields.


.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.Imagine if the Grand Canyon was originally a trench for giantsAnd every hole is where an artillery shell hit, its really astonishing to look at Verdun and other sections of north-eastern France and Belgium.

Fun fact, their still digging up undetonated land mines, shells and grenades from that area (The red zone i think its called) so about 102 years of cleaning.Australians died there. Motherfucking Australians from the other side of the damn world. This might be a good time to mention The Great War on YouTube is covering WW1 week by week as it was 100 years ago with added bonus videos.

And no I don't work for them it's really that good.There's a BBC documentary called ""The First World War From Above""  that's currently on US Netflix (and, apparently, [also on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8C_CIdmk8)) that does a great job of exploring the scars that the trenches and battles of WWI left on Europe. Well worth a watch.to put the First world war into perspective, there is a 1 foot thick layer of iron stained soil which stretches across parts of France and Belgium which is entirely composed of shrapnel and debris from the war. 

the trenches, shell craters and structures may erode away, but the layer of war will remain for millennia below the surface. Pictures from WWI continue to amaze me and instill a sense of humbleness and pride (being Canadian, and all). I have been fortunate enough to visit Vimy Ridge and the surrounding area twice. The first time the monument was being restored, so thankfully I was able to go again a couple years ago. It was a great experience, and I highly suggest anyone go if you get the chance. From what I remember, the tours at Vimy Ridge are free; you just sign up for a time when you get there. I also suggest renting a car and just driving all over. You will stumble upon many different WWI and WWII sites that are must-sees. Can't wait to go back!

Even though this will be buried, if anyone is interested in seeing pictures, feel free to ask.There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools, singing at night,

And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,

Would scarcely know that we were gone.

- Sara TeasdaleWell how do you do now, you Willie MacBride?
Do you mind if I sit down beside your graveside
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun?
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done 

Well I see by your gravestone you was only nineteen
When you joined the great fallen of nineteen sixteen
Well I hope you died well and I hope you died clean
Or Willie MacBride was it low and obscene? 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Did you leave a young wife or a sweetheart behind?
In some faithful heart are your memories enshrined?
For although you died back in nineteen sixteen
In that faithful heart you're forever nineteen 

Or are you a stranger without even a name
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane
In an old photograph tor, battered and stained
Faded to yellow with brown leather frayed?


Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

As the sun beats down on the green fields of France
There's a soft summer breeze makes the red poppies dance
And see how the sun shines from under the clouds
There's no gas, there's no barbed wire, no guns firing now 

Oh but here in this grave yard it's still no man's land
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
And through man's blind indifference to his fellow man
To a whole generation who were butchered and damned 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Now Willie MacBride, I can't help wonder why
All those that lie here now why did they die?
And did they believe when they answered the call
Did they really believe tat this war could end wars? 

Oh the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain
The killing and dying, 'twas all done in vain
For, Willie MacBride, oh it happened again
And again and again and again and again 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest?

I lived in one for 7 years.  It was heaven, especially with babies/toddlers.  A warm floor for baby to hang out on is fabulous.  Many people chose to rip out the boiler required to run the system and install central heat.  Those people regretted it.  Radiant Floor Heating. Yes, they are very effective. They usually use a small boiler and run a type of liquid through the piping. Along with good use of insulation in the walls/floor/ceiling - these can save a lot of money in the long-run. And bare feet in winter are great!

Edit: A few people are saying this system pictured is electric. Perfectly possible, I know electric systems are also available. I work for a building supply company and we are just getting into the Radiant Heat in the past month or two.I went to Iceland in December, and was pleasantly surprised to find that many buildings are heated this way. They basically get free heated water from wells, and pump it through the floors. They were even in the process of getting this outside of the airport in Reykjavik.I never knew this looked that cool. I'd just throw some plexi glass over it and have some led strips and go all tron on it. The whole floor is lava and thus off limitsThat was my one regret when I had my bathroom redone, that I didn't get heated floor. I'm still kicking myself.The Weltzheimer/Johnson House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright had a system similar to this design.  That was back in 1948.  The problem occurred when the contractor ignored the grade of the material specified on the architectural drawing, and the system never worked properly.I lived in Korea for 5 years and every apartment I lived in had it. I really miss it.Rich friend had underfloor heating in his basment. A blanket on his concert floor felt better than my bedThese are great for bathroom floors! I've been looking for some kind of warming bath mat that doesn't require an outlet (because most bathroom outlets are high up so a wire would have to run all the way up and look unsightly) but apparently those are more of a thing in Japan than in the states...when i was in korea i had those boy it was so great . i wish we had them back in the states.Is this form of heating uncommon in the states? In Denmark where I live, nearly all houses (especially the ones built within the last 20 or so years) have them.Any idea whether these are more efficient?Well driller here, although it may cost a good chunk of change for the average home owner, vertical or horizontal geothermal loops can be drilled to various depths, essentially sharing Earth's energy with your home. I live in South Korea and this is the best thing ever. It's in every apartment. Just don't leave trash or laundry on the floor for too long. Wow I didnt know you can get that attention with somthing simple as a floor heating.
I live in switzerland and am a HVAC engenieer and this systems are standard since the 70es for residential buildings. Nowadays we plan them with water temperatures of around 30°-35°C, so the floor doesent really feel warm at all, but with really well insulated homes you dont need higher temperatures to heat the home which is really good if you use heatpumps because the efficency of the heatpumps are way better if you use low temperature systems like that.
The most efficient systems are TABS (thermo active building systems) where you build the pipes inside the concrete itself and use the concerete as a heat reserve, also good for cooling.
Sorry for my bad english, if someone wants more information just contact me :)

The City of Boston claims a 60% reduction in power consumption and full replacement paying of in just 2-3 years.  Fantastic program.The light pollution effect is *very* evident in this picture.  Notice the foliage between the lamps on either side--the traditional lighting shows an orange bleed for the entire area, yet the trees between the LED lamps are almost completely unilluminated.Those orange lights sure are going to be nostalgic in 20 years...Which city is this?From this angle, the LED lamp posts look to be more efficiently directing the light. Compared to the conventional post which appears to be shining light everywhere with limited efficiency. Unless there is a great deal of reflection of light from the pavement, I'd say that light pollution is less likely. The way I understand it, LED's are more directional that conventional light bulbs. But that's only my opinion.LED looks much more natural. I hate the orange street lights. Always have. Wish this was happening on my street!/r/darksky would like this.depends on the white balance on your camera tooThey started this in my city, and I'm actually not a fan of it.

I travel on a highway to work almost every day. The lamp posts are more spaced apart and much higher up than in this picture, so the light is less concentrated and the dark spots you see in this photo are much larger. 

The orange street lights spread the light out better and didn't leave dark patches like the LED's did. The LED's are worse during the winter as well because they are much dimmer in my city than in this picture. The orange lights help distinguish definition on the road much better, but with the LED street lights, its harder to tell where icy/deep snow patches might be.

These would be a great for city driving where the posts are usually shorter and closer together and would illuminate the street as well as it does in this picture, but for highway and winter driving, the orange is better.

But that's just my opinionI, personally, prefer warmer colored lights.They did this to my street sometime around 3 weeks ago. It only really decreases light pollution above lamp level. You know, reduces the pink sky effect. 

The HUGE downside is that the inside of my house looks like daytime now. And the light is blue. Blue = bad at night (thanks f.lux). 

I used to be able to sleep with my curtains open. White curtains. I hadn't slept well in a week, and had one of those aha moments when you're lying in bed at 2am, curtains closed, looking at the ceiling and thinking holy crap its bright blue in here, with the curtains closed, its bright as hell. 

Replaced my white curtains with red ones to mute out the blue, and now I'm fine. Then I think, how many people will lose sleep like me, and not realize the issue, and then wake up and screw my commute by driving tired and getting into accidents. 


And also, why couldn't the get a warmer colour temp for the LED's? Blue sucks, at least give me yellow or something. These new lights have been attracting the gypsy moths back

Wanna put shout out to r/invasivespecies for the info!I have no source for this, just something that I heard, but apparently there is some question over the long term health effects that replacing the sodium lamps will have. The white LEDs simulate sunlight, whereas the sodium lamps are more similar to candlelight in terms of coloring. I guess there is some discussion over whether or not this shift will disrupt the natural sleep cycles of people walking around at night, or even having this light shining in through their windows. 

On a small scale, the shift is not expected to be bad, but if they were to replace every street lamp, apparently there might be some problems. 

Anyone care to verify or dispute these claims? Idk if OP knows but the LED lamps probably look better in this picture because of the white balance setting on the camera that captured this shot. Maybe I'm nitpicking though.Chicago resident here... They have been slowly replacing the old street lights the the new LED bulbs over the past few years in our glorious city. They got to our street last fall and once the polar vortex struck with its powerful might we noticed the streets were dark at night. The new bulbs couldn't melt the snow and ice off the lamps like they use to!! They actually had crew go around and knock the buildup off. Thanks Obama!Replacing sodium vapor lamps with white LEDs as street lights is a good plan, but not a great one.  I think that replacing them with red or orange LEDs would have been a much better idea, since you still need your night vision once you leave that road that looks like it's lit by the sun.I hate the cold white of the LED street lamps... I liked my warm orange glow =(It's worth noting the Hwite balance of the photo is set to the temperature of the LED lights so it makes the Tungsten lights look like shit; not a really fair photography.

[A photograph I took for Instance](http://i.imgur.com/u5JREM5.jpg), the camera White Balance was set for the Tungsten lights up front, the halogen around the side as a result turned a a very noticeable Green color in the photography; with the naked eye the lights looked the same.I wish they'd tint them orange. It's easier on the eyes for night driving I thought. (Other than that the old ones were naturally reddish).That tall building in the background has a faceThe building almost directly centre looks so happy.Random note - the yellow/orange lights actually produce more lumens (more light) per bulb, but due to the light being more omni-directional and having a bad color-rendering index, to humans the LEDs appear like a much better light. This looked so Korean, so I zoomed in and found that it was Korea.LEDs are a complicated issue. They save energy but the cheapest kind emit blue-rich light which simulate the daylight which can be harmful to humans and animals alike. The rule to remember is to use red light at night. Just the other day, LEDs received a Nobel Prize. You can read about how that might affect dark skies and light pollution [here](http://darksky.org/night-sky-conservation/421).

Is 12 the number of victims?How or why is it necessary to have a prop mattress? Why not just supply an existing mattress off the factory run? Surely it's harder to have a separate manufacturing line for fake mattresses, no?Ran to my bedroom almost hoping that my back-breaking bed was a prop, but it's just a shitty bed.Did the owner [do this](http://blog.chron.com/tubular/files/2011/11/mission-accomplished-ad.gif) after you signed the lease?I'm a DM for Mattress Firm. PM me if you need something new and I'll get you something as cheap as I can get it without getting fired.check your TV, it might be a prop as well It's dangerous because that material is likely HIGHLY flammable.  Beds must have a flame resistance to them, and since thats NOT a bed, its a PROP, it could go up in flames instantly. It was fit for a queen, however I'm pretty sure there was a pea in the mattress.

You needed 5 more on top of that m'thinks.Do you smell that?

Smells like a lawsuit.

At the very least they need to buy you a new Mattress and a 10 pack of visits to your local Chiropractor's office (mine does $75 for an extended visit with heat and electrical stimulus if you pay in cash)This is a lawsuit if it's actually real. Canadian here chiming in; that is seriously wrong. In Canada, all hotels must pass a bi-monthly law of the ""soft touch"" bed test. They actually have people visit and test hotel beds for softness.Do you live in Sudden Valley?Brings a whole new meaning to death bed.People used to always joke about why it is against the law to rip tags off of mattresses. This is why it's the law, so you don't buy a dud mattress from a shady dealer. (Though, it can be removed by the consumer, so you're lucky it is still there.)Sounds like it's from the Bluth model home.I would check your lease documents to see if there is any stipulations about the furniture, have a lawyer review it as well and write the landlord a letter to have a new mattress purchased or at least a prorated amount to purchase a new one. Also renters insurance might cover some chiropractic visits to help with the back pain. Most of all talk to a lawyer to see if there is a legal avenue for you to pursue. 
good luck!I wonder if Michael Bluth had this problem.Is this your house?

* there are lots of formations that they don't tell you about; like a ll the ""lint-ites"":  lint from people's clothes that get stuck on the formations.  volunteers come in the summer to clean the cave. (with hoses and tweezers)
* it's 59 degrees and 90% humidity downstairs, while it can be 95 degrees and really dry upstairs
* the best lighted formation in the cave is not labelled.  it's  to the left of the elevator in the big room, it's called the ""virgin of guadelupe"" (rangers are not allowed to point it out)
* it takes 90 years for something to grow as big as the tip of your pinky (from the last knuckle to the tip).  They know this because a passage was created between two rooms for a tour, and the stalactites growing on the ceiling of that new man-made passage (in 1920; well; now almost 100 years old) are that large. (for the kings-queens tour)
* lighting was done by professional stage /theater lighters.  Lighting for cave pictures is *really hard*.  if you go, I recommend just buying the post cards.
[Speaking of a wheelchair accessible pit into the abyss...](http://i.imgur.com/6ghcdDq.jpg)I remember this place for all the wrong reasons.

Our family took a 3 week long road trip around America and we stopped here. It was myself, Mom and Dad, and 4 other brothers. 3 of my brothers went ahead while my other brother (call him Brett) stayed with me  (still ahead of my parents). I was 10 at the time and I just remember Brett wandering in a small circle in the middle of the path looking up at the top. I called out his name, he collapsed and I immediately ran and got my parents. People passing by offered and hand while I ran and got help from paramedics.My dad and Brett went back up while my mom and I continued downward (she physically couldn't walk back up the ramp). Terrified and concernced, we continued on the path with some of the darkest blackness we'd ever experienced trying to find my other 3 brothers. long story short, we find a ranger after a wn hour or so, describe my brothers to her and guides us to the bottom. Thankfully my brother recovered and we continued on our trip with just a 1 day delay.

TL;DR: On vacation here brother collapsed from a seizure and we lost 3 of my brothers in the cavernWas there last weekend. Can confirm, there was a guy who almost ran over my toes with a motorized wheelchair 750 ft below ground. Probably took the elevator though.

This is a great example showing why honey bees die after stinging something only once. Their stinger/venom sac are attached to other organs inside the bee, so when the stinger's barbs lodge into something, everything gets pulled out, potentially including gut, etc and leaving a gaping hole in the bees abdomen.

Another interesting fact: the stinger that gets left behind is composed of the stinger/barb, the venom sac, a layer of muscle tissue surrounding the venom sac and a nerve ganglion attached to the muscle. Independent of the bee, that nerve ganglion continues to contract the muscle around the venom sac, pumping more and more venom into the victim even if the bee has run off.  This is why when you get stung by a bee, you want to scrape the stinger out ASAP with a flat tool. (Don't try to pull it out with your fingers, you'll just squish the venom sac and empty it all in at once).[deleted]If I ever have a metal band, this will be the cover to my album.Spiderman.  Venom.

Life isn't much wackier than comedy.IF you are so unstable that you can't fly on a plane without a live turkey, you should not fly. Imagine if that bird died mid flight? Buddy could do anything. avian flu - the originDelta airlines requires a mental health professional to provide written documentation that the passenger is being treated for a diagnosed mental health disability and the animal is a necessary part of treatment. Further, the animal is required to be trained to behave. I'm guessing this passenger didn't follow those rules, and the crew and gate agents didn't know enough to deny passage.

From the website:

**Acceptance Guidelines**

May or may not be trained to perform observable functions. However, the animal must be trained to behave properly in public settings as service animals do. Emotional support animals travel free of charge and the animal is exempt from cabin allotment. Like service animals, emotional support animals can be transported in the cabin.

Delta requires documentation *(not more than one year old) on letterhead from a licensed mental health professional to be presented to an agent upon check in stating:

* Title, address, license number and jurisdiction (state/country it was issued), phone number, and signature of mental health professional.
* The passenger has a mental health related disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 4th Edition.
* That the passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination.
* That the person listed in the letter is under the care of the assessing physician or mental health professional.

*Passengers may use a signed or stamped digital letter on their mobile device as long as the information can be verified (i.e. phone numbers, email addresses etc.)I'd be doing this the entire flight to the bird 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zvgcOrTtwMy hopes of one day having a service Cassawary have been reignited!The only reason anyone would ever need a goddamn dumb dinosaur like a turkey for a therapy animal is if they needed absolute reassurance they weren't quite the stupidest organism in the room. And even then, itd be close.If their plane crashes in the mountains at least they won't need to start eating each other right away like those soccer players did.I hate these assholes, it makes it so much harder for those of us with legitimate, trained, vetted and certified service dogs.

I tried so hard to be nice about it for so long but I just can't any more. The day someone's glorified pet, with no public access training attacked my service dog was the day the minor annoyance of it became a real issue I'm pushed passed my limits on. You want to take your unleashed, uneutered mastiff with a piece of shit paper you bought online everywhere for the attention? Fuck you. 

When that dog bit someone on the bus now we all have to pay for photo ID of us and our dog, thankfully I already have that since one of countries I regularly travel to(in the EU) requires it.

--
**Remember business owners:** 
Even certified service dogs, let alone bullshit ESAs,  have a set of public access behaviour guidelines, you CAN remove an animal who is NOT behaving within those guidelines. 

The dog taking the initiative of greeting strangers approaching the animal should be a clue the dog is not properly public accessed trained. The dog should automatically ignore others because it is WORKING, as in focused on it's handler and it's job.


This even includes the handler responsibilities, like keeping the animal from being any kind of nuisance- via position on the floor or noise or general disruptiveness; and keeping the animal groomed, clean and non-offensive to the general public. Dogs will always smell somewhat like dogs but the dog should not be excessively smelly, should not be drooling excessively, should not be shedding excessively as the animal should be brushed daily by the handler or helper. Nails should be tidily cut and not damaging floors. 
Harness/ID vests should be clean and properly fitted. (in the US service dogs do not have to have badges or harnesses, but this is pretty ridiculous, almost everyone with a certified service dog will have it wearing it's identification vest/badge and harness because it makes life easier for the handler!! If the badges on the dog says 'do not seperate from handler' there is a reason for this- please respect this, yes even in an emergency. For example my dog traveled with me in the ambulance after a serious car accident until we absolutely had to be separated so he could receive medical treatment. During something like an MRI/X ray he is in the operator's hut in the same room as the machine but protected. )
 


And remember: ESAs do NOT have federal access rights. They have some housing and transport rights but they DO NOT have access rights to stores, theatres or restaurants!

(Also the Service Dog Foundation is now training ESA cats with proper certification and are vetted behaviour-wise, if you need a non service dog but do need an ESA get a properly trained and bred one. Get a prescription, apply to an accrediated organisation, preferable ADI certified,  and get on the waiting list like those of use with seizues/are blind and low vision have to do. Stop with this special snowflake pretend service animal bullshit. I'm sorry to sound so mean but in the past three years the rise of this ESA crap has been a real burden on those of us with real service dogs. The animal just existing is not  a job. Training a proper, bomb proof service dog starts *before the puppy's eyes are even open!!*)More like ""anxiety animal"" for me. I would constantly be worried that thing we attack others or myself hahaI'd need therapy if that thing was looking at me for 2 hours.[Gobbels!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeOeIwKJ67g)I thought turkeys can't fly.What I want to know is how do they keep the turkey from shitting everywhere?!

Their babies are lain in clutches and then promptly forgotten (though even to say that they are forgotten is incorrect, since forgetting requires some initial presence of mind: in truth this tortoise has perhaps never been truly aware [in the human sense] of what exactly its instincts force it to do). There is no plausible scenario in which those little tortoises would possibly find themselves on top of their mother: first because they are tiny and second because their mother is no more significant to them than a pile of dirt or a largish chunk of granite. In fact it is in the baby tortoises' best interest to stay away from their mother since (as I said before) the mother has no maternal instinct whatsoever and could easily and inadvertently crush them underfoot or knock them on their backs or harm them in some other way (the chance of this happening is admittedly pretty slim, but there is certainly a greater chance that the mother will hurt them rather then help them [which {I pray I have made abundantly clear} is exactly zero since tortoises have no maternal instincts whatsoever]). This is anthropomorphising at its worst and images like this that actively misinform people through implication are no different than any other kind of clickbait in that they convolute a genuinely interesting subject by (rather than putting forth the effort required to present something both interesting and informative) simply slapping an eye-catching title on a misleading image. Can we not simply accept that certain animals behave differently than us? This is a successful reproductive strategy: the product of millions upon millions of years of evolution (or perhaps not: I can't imagine ignoring your children requires a lot of evolutionary finesse: but still, the fact that it has not changed into something else speaks to how effective it is). Looked at from that perspective, there is beauty here that needs not be ""enhanced"" with anthropomorphic implications.The mom of Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo and Raphael.The Great A'TuinI just want to see a Terry Pratchett reference in the comments.

I didn't have any destination I wanted to explore. It is a big city, but it is also not big.

The thing that amazed me is that architecture and history you can find that are off the main tourist areas. You can walk and see a building 400 plus years old with old historic doors. Inside a courtyard with cobble stones and people living their lives in buildings that would be historic in America.

You can walk by and go inside many churches hundreds of years old that people still use. See one of the small Museums that dot the city. Walking you can find the most amazing restaurants, grab a quick drink and see the city move around you.

Maybe I should feel bad, but when walking Paris I couldn't help to think to myself I am glad the French left the war early and it was spared destruction in the war. I get weird Devil May Cry vibes from it.Pretty sure that's also the door from Casper... or at least very close to it. An amazing example of art nouveau.First stop after retirement: Paris. Any takers?  I speak French. Must see it before it's detroyed in some dumb money/oil war.Belle Epoque was the epitome of that kind of design. It died with WW1 and the end of the European empires. I wish Art Nouveau would return. It was very labour intensive but perhaps CNC, CAD and 3D printing will see it return in a updated fashion. Its so florid and strikes me as 'human'. ""Arts Craft"" in many ways is a distilled version of this, boiling designs to their bare, hand made essentials.

It must have seemed like the end of the era of Legend, to those who born in this period, grew up and then served in WW1.We not talking about the massive cock  on the door? Reminds me of a pun in French/English.

I think your dog is trying to tell you something by creating a large bundle of sticks outside your house and its not nice.From an animal behaviour standpoint, why would a pet or dog do this?  I can see it thinking of it as a positive reward if it brings something back to it's pack (in this case, the owner).  Or maybe it just likes chewing on sticks (it could help dental hygiene, be entertaining, seem like a replacement for doggie toys or actual prey), and it drops them in the same spot near the house before it goes inside?  Or maybe it's akin to a nest-building tendency in other species to collect things from around their environment that could either provide shelter or potentially impress a mate.I believe your dog is a hoarder.

-don't slam on your brakes (additionally: check your car manual if your car requires brake pumping or not)

-before braking, let up the gas first for about 2 seconds before using the brake pedal

-increase your braking distance significantly compared to dry conditions. You will slide if you attempt to stop at what may seem a reasonable rate normally and lose control (thanks, /u/my_dog_is_cool)

-keep a cars length between you and driver in front of you when stopped

-if you know you are going or about to go over a bridge, don't accelerate or brake unless you need to (bridge ices before road)

-accelerate while going up hills

-don't ever break going up hills

-don't ever use cruise control

-if the light turns green before you approach the intersection (meaning you did not make a full stop yet), proceed with caution (someone from the previous light might still slip in the intersection on accident)

-look both ways when the light turns green before proceeding

-keep the top of your car free of snow (for drivers behind you)

-keep the hood of your car free of snow (for your benefit when that wind blows)

-put your emergency blinkers on the moment you are seriously stuck

-wear sunglasses during the daytime (you'll see outlines of curbs and medians better)

-never use your brights (it's like a million mirrors blinding you)

Furthermore, they wanted accessible seating and trash disposal, meaning you need wheelchair-traversible surfacing all the way around both features (the bench and bin). Finally, at that point they probably live in a place that requires fencing around non-supervised play areas, so naturally to save money, they made it as small as possible.

This also applied to schools, daycares or any other places kids meet. So any of the registered sex offenders had to move.

Zoom in and look at the sharks eyes. That's what a surprised shark looks like. That's a juvenile bull shark, so it will give you a nasty nip but is not really dangerous. They are in pretty much every river and residential canal estate in Australia. Bull sharks are born and grow up in fresh water, entering the ocean when they are grown, where they are indeed a bunch of dicks.

There are two types of croc in Australia: freshwater crocs (aka freshies), and saltwater crocs (aka salties). Brutus is a salty.

Determining the difference is easy enough. Simply jump into the river. If the croc quietly climbs out on the opposite bank and gives you a surly look, it's a freshie.

If the croc surges toward you, grabs your leg and pulls you under the water in a choas of flailing limbs, rolls around a few times and drowns you, then swims off and plants your body in a mud bank,  returning to take a bite from your rotting corpse every couple of days, then it was a salty.He stopped the shark from drowning.

No really though this is the most impressive thing I've seen in forever.Senator Franken is sharp as anything, and actually an excellent senator.

Storytime: My mother was (recently retired) a teacher. She met the Senator about five, six years back when he came to her school to talk to the kids. He actually drew one of these in front of them as he talked. He then spent some time in the teacher's lounge talking to my mom. At the time, my father was in the process of dying of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, which they discussed.

He met her again a few years later, and asked after him (by name, mentioning the disease - didn't just file it away under ""random teacher - sick husband""), and gave his condolences. He remembered that shit the whole time, after one meeting. Didn't need to - he had her vote to begin with and he knew it - he's just got a memory like a freaking vice.

It says ""Still no terror attacks in France"" with the terrorist saying ""hang on, we still have until the end of January to give our new year wishes""It must be noted that Charlie Hebdo has always made fun of all religions, not only islam.Charb, one of the caricaturists killed today, said earlier, after receiving death threats from islamists: **""I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit. It perhaps sounds a bit pompous, but I prefer to die standing than living on my knees.""** Source: http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/charlie-hebdo-charb-cabu-wolinsky-et-tignous-morts-dans-la-fusillade-07-01-2015-1894661_23.php[Four cartoonists](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6v8_6WCQAIYRnq.jpg) are said to be dead: Charb, Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski.

This is not the first time Charlie Hebdo was the target of an attack (they were torched in 2011), but I never thought someone would go that hard on them. 

Dear God, these guys were awesome, they will be thoroughly missed.never give up!

humor is immortal!

http://i.imgur.com/xeoCHEM.jpgThat's terrible.
I'm french and I'm so sad.
The signification of this attack is very strong. They wounded freedom.
Four cartoonists, they killed an economist too, Bernard Maris, I listened him on national radio ""France Inter"" on the morning.
RIPThe sad thing is that many have hoped media around the world would publish the cartoons that led to this tragedy. But what has actually happened is media blurring the cartoons in fear. Example from the Telegraph in the UK: http://i.imgur.com/lwcqqrY.png

Edit: Full context on the page: http://i.imgur.com/eYKGcaw.pngThe cartoonists are Cabu and Charb, but other people have been killed too, including cartoonists Wolinski and Tignous.

Here are some of their work:

[Cabu](http://a54.idata.over-blog.com/3/88/02/15/2010-101112/charlie_hebdo_c_est_dur_d_etre_aime_par_des_cons_cabu.jpg) - Translation: *Mahomet overwhelmed by integrists* ; ""It's tough, being loved by such cunts""

[Charb](http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2015/01/07/1714196-b6v30sgcuaai-ol.jpg) - Translation: *No terrorist attacks in France so far* ; ""Wait! We have 'til the end of January to present our wishes/resolutions...""

[Wolinski](http://a404.idata.over-blog.com/500x479/2/31/51/01/758/Wolinski.gif) - Translation: the sign reads *Attack claimed by far-right extremists* ; Policemen: ""Walk slower, or we'll have no choice but to arrest them!"" ; Perpetrators: ""Walk faster, or they'll have no choice but to arrest us!""  
NOTE: Wolinski did very few policital drawings compared to his peers and was mostly known for his drawings on sexual perversion. I selected this drawing because a) it's the only political one I could find and b) it's one of the few that aren't NSFW.

[Tignous](http://marcsuivre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/caricature-tignous-islam1.jpg) - Translation: Man: ""You ought to cover yourself!"" ; Woman: ""Do you want it in the gabber, my Hand of Fatima?""[this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Wolinski) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignous) also, apparently. RIPThey apparently yelled that they were avenging Mohammed. What kind of god or prophet needs vengeance from a comic? These attacks don't show people's strength of conviction, they show the weakness of their beliefs. No one has ever strapped a bomb to their chest because of their belief in quantum mechanics or group theory.Between the majority of media's decision not to show these artists' works uncensored, and Sony caving to North Korea's (partially successful) attempt to prevent the release of The Interview, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the way our culture has caved to the violent, threatening tactics of fanaticism. Free-thinking nations should not be shriveling up like this in the face of hatred and oppression of thought. What a shameful time we live in.Jesus fucking christ, it's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated.

Some of you mentioned that you shouldn't do something that will offend all Muslims. I disagree. No group and no person should be above satire. Side note: A connect-the-dots of ""TPM"" would be fun if it was directed at the proper websites. You know, I'm extremely liberal when it comes to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and open immigration, but even I think it's time for Europe to tell Muslim immigrants to assimilate or expatriate. You want to wear hijabs and preach in the street? Fine. Want to convert old, unused churches to mosques? Groovy, awesome way to preserve architecture.

Cabu (left) was an household name in France. Such a sweet, intelligent, strong guy. Participated in the children broadcasts we were all watching in the 80s.

Also many drivers in Ireland don't consider this a ""speed limit"", but instead more of a suggested or required average.

""Well if it says 80, I better go 80"".

Prepare to be airborne for most of this lane.Back to boards.ie with ye, lads. The beginning of The Guard is good for an idea of what most roads are like. Black humour on the speed and the Guards in Ireland.rural roads in Ireland are the stuff of dreams if you enjoy driving, it makes you a better driver you have no choice about it :P
nothing scarier than being flat down a back road and seeing a tractor pulling out of a gap :P keep her country ;)Some people do drive far too quickly on those sorts of roads. I think often they're locals who assume that because they know every turn and bump on the road and drive it at speed every day nothing unexpected will ever happen.

Setting a speed limit for a local road like that is a matter for the local council. There is a [national review](http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0208/speed.html) of speed limits ongoing in Ireland at the request of the Minister for Transport. The aim is to bring them into line with guidelines circulated by the government in January 2011. It is, ironically, a very slow process.http://imgur.com/G4OXx

It's also probably a dual carriageway.Stick the Subaru logo in the corner and we've got ourselves a winning billboard advertisement.My brother drives very fast down country lanes a little wider than that in England. 

On a moonlit night he will turn his headlights off and drive even faster, to show how well he knows the roads, and say ""don't worry, if a car's coming the other way we'll see his headlights"" ... [brief pause] ... ""unless it's Dave. Dave likes to do this too"". And then he smiles. Being an American that's driven the majority of the Emerald Isle, I was constantly amazed at how ridiculous the speed limits were. I'd go maybe 20 km/h under the limit, feel I was going too fast and still have people up against my back bumper. Driving there is, in a word, insane.I learned to drive manual on vacation in Ireland.  Zipping around those roads in a tiny car was the most enjoyable driving experience of my life.    Taking the coastal road in Co Clare was gorgeous, and dodging the massive tour buses just added an extra challenge.  For safety of life and limb I preferred to stick to the R roads though.That's actually an old picture, there's a toll bridge just after the speed limit sign now. My friend went to Northern Ireland and tore the driver's side mirror off the rental car on one of these roads when meeting an oncoming truck. When he returned the car they were just like ""Yeah, that's what happens. Have a nice day.""As an Irishman I can assure you all that 80kph is a grand speed for this road. You don't even need to steer, those soft looking ditches on either side will gently nudge you back on track if you lose your way.Damn, I miss Ireland. 

Nice landscape & reasonable speed limits.

(Also, as a german, i must insist: 80 km/h != Autobahn !)Thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x84r.jpg) was pretty funny my first time there on those narrow roads.There's nothing more terrifying than when I'm in the passenger seat of my gf's car, and she takes he country roads out to Donegal and they're all exactly like this picture. We'll pass an 80kmph sign, and she'll turn to me with this evil grin like ""I'm gonna fuck you up!""

We're from N. Ireland where the roads laws are a bit more strict. I think Dara O'Brien but it best. 

In the UK there is Legal and Illegal. Righ and Wrong.
In the Republic of Ireland, there are 3 levels. 
1. That's Grand. 
2. Ah now, don't push it.
3. You're taking the piss.  One of my most vivid memories of Ireland is driving on a two-lane road the size of a shoulder on a cliff-side and having people whiz by at 80 km/h.WHOAH, here in spain the limit in not paved roads are 30km/h.

This is Las Vegas. You can tell by the giant pointy thing in the middle.What are those columns under the arch at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower? Are they temporary/permanent supports?

I went to Paris in 2013 and they were there are the time.Just for info, since this perspective of ""Paris"" is so common, but it's misleading. The photo is taken from the Montparnasse tower. You see a zoom of the Eiffel Tower in the foreground, and the Business district of La Défense in the background, but those towers of La Défense aren't in Paris proper. They're in the suburbs. Here's how the photo was taken: http://i.imgur.com/zwgGzUa.jpg

Just saying, most of what you see in the photo isn't Paris proper.I would love a high resolution version of this.Amazing picture.  
  
Why do all the rooftops in the foreground look like scrapyards?

Fell absolutely in love with it. Truly a beautiful city from any angle. La Defense always looks so futuristic from this angle. I think it's because of it contrasting with the historic Eiffel Tower.I see the beauty in that picture and then I remember the time a bird shat on my face under the Eiffel Tower.I didn't know the Eiffel Tower had a football field in front of it!Is that La Defense in the back?The smog brings a nice ambient glow to the shot.More like ""smogset""Don't you just love how the light catches the pollution.

http://i.imgur.com/B3FUlc2.png...Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, Bosun's Mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.Practically all people on the ship are black, practically all people in the water are white.

I was crying and being a typical whiny 4 year old (I was also malnourished and dirty) and this one cop kept me company in the house while everyone else was outside discussing things. He read me a book and played with my stuffed animals with me, and we had a lot of fun. After I was removed from the home, he showed up at my court appearances for almost a year. Officer Clarke was a great guy. Cops like him, and this guy really set the standard for what it means to be a public servant. My father was a paramedic in the city for 30 years..he has never cut a dead body out of a seat belt.
Edit: thanks for the gold! To clarify, Every time my father has had to cut a seat belt, the person was alive. Seat belts save lives, so do helmets. I always wear my seat belt, even if I'm driving around the block, not because I don't trust my own driving,..but I don't trust anyone else.This is heartbreaking.  One of my biggest somewhat irrational fears is that they won't be able to find someone to quickly take care of my kids if something unexpectedly happens to me.  I imagine they'd be so confused and scared.  I hope they found this little girl's relatives quickly.This brings back so many memories from when I was 7- years-old. All 8 members of my family were on a road trip in a 7 passenger van all of us were wearing seatbelts except my 4-year-old brother, Jake, who was sitting in my 12-year-old sister's lap, Cara. It was morning and I was asleep in the front seat while my dad was driving. Next thing I know I wake up hanging in the air because the van had rolled and finally settled on the driver's side.

Everyone was out of the car already and my dad helped me climb out through the back of the van. As soon as I step out I see my oldest sister(17),Lynn, covered in blood and my 10-year-old sister, Jess screaming for someone to help Lynn. Someone guided me and Jess away from the accident and set us on a blanket facing an empty field. We moved to a truck when it started raining before riding in an ambulance with my mom and Jake on a stretcher.

The 5 of us who were wearing our seat belts properly walked away hardly any scratches. Lynn wasn't wearing her shoulder belt and went half way out the window and broke her clavicle and got around 40 staples in her leg and some stitches. She stayed in the hospital a few days and made a full recovery. 

Jake and Cara were the only ones not wearing seatbelts at all. They were ejected from the car together and Cara acted as a cushion for Jake and very likely saved his life. He needed some stitches but was fine otherwise. Cara died within minutes.

After the fact I learned that Cara had been wearing her seatbelt just minutes before the accident. Lynn had asked Cara to get something from the back and she and Jake were both leaning over the backseat at the time of the accident.

Don't even take your seatbelt off for a second.[deleted]""Police say the two adults and four kids in the SUV were not properly restrained. All of them were ejected in the crash.""

OK. This is terrible but if you can't use your fucking seat belts to protect your family...People please wear your damn seat belt!! I just pulled a guy out of his over turned Ford Taurus in front of my house that had flipped 4 times Monday of this week who survived because he was wearing his seat belt. If he hadnt been im almost positive he wouldve been dead easily. It is in the car for a reason!Some years back I rear ended another driver. Slammed into the back of their car at about 50mph. We all walked away okay. My airbag and seatbelt kept me okay. I ended up with a small burn on my arm from the airbag. Apparently even the officer told me it was a high accident area.

Now recently I was getting ready to head to Disneyland with my inlaws and infant son. We're getting ready to get into the car and I noticed the number of people(5 adults and an infant) and their car is a five seater. I asked if we we're taking two cars and they said the baby was going to ride on somebody's lap. I was a wee bit pissed and put my foot down. My son rode in his car seat and we crammed three adults in the back seat. If they want to risk their safety that's fine. But like Hell I was going to let them risk my son's.[deleted]It's 2015. How in the actual hell are people still not using seatbelts? I don't even realize that I'm putting it on - it's just a reflex as is putting the keys in the ignition. You really have to make a conscious decision to not put your seatbelt on. I don't feel like it's something that you just forget to do. If I'm not buckled in, I feel that everything is horribly wrong.Here's a story I don't like telling much, but maybe it will convince somebody.

When I was 18 or 19, I lived overseas near an American air base in Germany and worked on base.  Every morning, I would leave for work later than I should have, and speed the whole way through these little villages and country roads.  If you've ever driven in Pennsylvania or other states in the area, kinda like that.

Near the base, there was a big blind corner that was pretty fun to go fast on, hugging the inside.  I did this hundreds of times, usually bleary-eyed and tired in the morning from staying up too late on AOL talking to this girl.  No big deal, the road was wide enough and there was rarely any traffic in the morning.

Then, one particular morning, I went around that curve and saw a woman in the street waving her arms.  I slowed down, and as I was doing so, I saw the car on its roof off to the left, and a body in the road about fifty yards ahead.  I pulled over, put my blinkers on, got out the warning triangle and first aid kit and ran over to the arm waver. I was the second person on the scene.

The obvious conversation happened, and I called whatever the 911 equivalent was over there, spoke broken English to some German guy, and then went to see what I could do about the woman in the street.

Her car was on its roof, and it was still running.  Something was playing on the radio and the exhaust pipe was emitting exhaust.  It was cold enough that you could see the exhaust. I turned the car off, and went back to the woman.  I have no useful medical training beyond some very basic first aid and a lapsed CPR certification, so all I could do was talk to her and put my coat and some emergency blankets on her.  She obviously had a head wound and was in and out of almost-consciousness. It had been drizzling, so the road was damp.  Her head was bleeding.  I can still see the water on the road mixed with her blood, and the dirt and rocks pressed in to the skin of her face, where her sweater was ripped on her shoulder, and the scratches on her skin.

Time passes.  No emergency services.  By this time I'd stopped traffic and spoken to the arm-waver about what had happened.  She'd seen it.  The victim went around the corner at the same time as a big truck coming the other way.  The truck was over the line a bit, and she over-corrected, flipped, and was ejected.

Called 911 again.  Same kind of conversation.  A little bit of time passes.  Finally this guy runs up with a baby in his arms.  He's her husband and got stuck in the traffic jam caused by his wife's accident.  He walked up to see what was going on and found out.  There's nothing he can do either.  Some emergency services from the base finally show up after somebody else had called, and they start doing their thing.  Those of us who are close enough to the scene are told to drive away and leave so that a helicopter can land soon.  I take my coat back, drive to work, and wash the blood off of my hands and my phone, and hide in the back for a little while so I can compose myself.

I had nightmares for about a month after that.  Not because of what I had seen really, but because if I had been maybe five or ten minutes earlier, if I was the first one on the scene and hadn't been stopped by the arm-waver, I probably wouldn't have been able to stop in time.  With wet roads like that, I probably would have driven over the victim in the road as I realized what was happening.  You can imagine what my dreams were about.

So, pay attention, and wear your goddamn seatbelts.
My friend, In a church group, got in a car accident in a head on collision going 55. Every person, except her, wasn't wearing their seat belt. Her mother, father, and 5 others were ejected from the vehicle. 3 people including her mother died, her father was a paraplegic and everyone else had severe injuries. She had a broken arm and some bruising. Seat belts save your your fucking life. This man can prove it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp""... Look for the helpers. You will always find people that are helping.""  - Mr. RogersNo matter how bad my day at the office is, I'm fucking glad I don't have to do this shit.This is one of the most heartbreaking photos I've ever seen.Wow. The most heroic thing I did today was smile at a dog.My wife responds that these kinds of calls about twice a week. Lately she has had her car spit on because of the immediate assumption that all cops are evil and want to shoot everyone. 

Yet she does stuff like you see in the photo for a living. Last week she went to two separate child deaths from crashes. Slightly different scenario but I want to give a shout out to one Officer Barcus, who helped distract me, a 28 year old graduate student, after I walked in and found my father had shot himself in the head at his house. As I was the only legal next of kin there (my mom was there but she was divorced from my dad) I had to wait for the Coroner to sign paperwork. On the worst day of my life, this cop talked to me, asked me about what I was studying, and basically kept me from just completely freaking out. This was 20 years ago. It's often the smallest things that make the biggest difference. Fuck this hits home. Medic here. I've had some truly heart wrenching calls. One of which was a father who had taken his young daughter quadding with him. Rolled his quad and broke his neck.  His daughter sat with him for close to three days if I remember correctly. She was 5 or 6. Kept telling us to be quiet because daddy was sleeping. 

I've never cried on call before, but how do you explain to a child that young that daddy isn't sleeping. Daddy is dead. 

I went home and hugged my sister that night.This isn't cop stuff, this isn't man stuff or dad stuff... This is fucking real people stuff. Real human shit.Sauce -
http://www.9news.com/story/news/traffic/2015/06/18/i-76-closed-due-to-crash/28926321/For all the horrific stories about cops killing people, I worked for many years as a civilian crisis worker for LEOs.  People often don't understand how police are exposed to horrific circumstances and emotions that are 'just part of the job.'  For all the WTF and watchpeopledie subreddits here, police often see this stuff first hand.  Crime and accident scenes attack all the senses-- decaying bodies are one thing, but even the smell of blood and gore indoors is something that cannot be described.  It is much more intense than just seeing a photo on reddit.

I dealt with three cases that still haunt me.

1-  A cop responded to a dead baby in a home.  A mother just had taken her newborn home, was exhausted, fell asleep, rolled over, and smothered her baby.  Later, after that situation was handled, the same cop was called out to the interstate where there was a report of a dead deer in the road.  The same mother had jumped from an overpass at night, and was basically just a stain on the asphalt.  That cop had a very bad shift.

2-  A dead baby at a day care.... I'll skip the details here, but going through a debrief with a bunch of weeping police officers was very intense.  

These stories never made the news.

The third story happened more than 10 years ago, and it is still being litigated, and has been in the national media.  I will skip the details other than to say it involved a horrific mutilation in a public bathroom.... and a hysterical, surviving mother.  Everyone attached to the case was deeply affected for years.  I had a first responder reach out to me this week---- years later, to discuss the case.

I have a close friend who was a homicide detective.  It sucks driving around town with her, since everywhere she goes she points out, we had a murder there, a shooting there, a suicide there, etc.

It seriously does something to people, and they tend to become desensitized to many things as a coping mechanism.  It taints their world view to be exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, and they deal with life and death (mostly unnecessary death) on a regular basis.  I am not a police apologist, as I find it horrible how police in the US have become militarized.  But there is a reason some cops treat everyone like animals.

What I find sad is that many police don't have what it takes to work effectively with the general public.  They may have had it at one point, but it can disappear.  The profession should do a better job at psych screening.  It isn't that different than the PTSD people/soldiers get in war zones.  Even the 'Barney Fifes' working in rural areas are seeing brutal killings of 80 year old women in meth related cases, or horrific issues of child neglect.Thanks for helping show the good cops, OP.I could never be a police officer.

Imagine that kind of shit just being part of your fucking day. Once they were done at that crash site, that officer holding the child had to go do fucking paperwork.

How could you possibly get on with your day after distracting a newly-orphaned little boy/girl from the sight of their dead parents a handful of metres away?

In the spirit of ""I want a god damn window"" I like to imagine the common office worker, coming in on a weekend with an appropriate rented saw and just did the hole himself, patched up a cheap window in there, cleaned up everything and came back on monday to his ordinary office, which is now the only one with a window.It almost looks like another building use to be attached to that one? Or could it just be a shadow... No biggie, that's just room 1408.  OSHA regs. That's the fire escape.Sniper perch.I knew that building looked familiar, Clevelander for life :3One of the cool things that gets glossed over about Cleveland is that each of the buildings are old enough to carry some history. It may not be the caliber that Europe has, but over 100 years of development and change isn't paltry either. 

One of the defining statements of major cities these days are skyscrapers. If you think about it skyscraper technology isn't that old, only exploding in the past 50 years or so. 50 years ago, Cleveland was a fully functioning, top 10 US city. There was really no need to build up a brand new huge building (and you couldn't really). Excluding a few buildings in NYC, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in the world for 20 years and the US for 30. 

Unfortunately by this time the companies and jobs that made up Cleveland were being moved elsewhere and any new developments were quickly cancelled. That combined with the invention that is the air conditioner and Cleveland slowly lost it's status. We were still a top 10 city in 1970 which wasn't *that* long ago.

Regarding these tourism videos, yes I am from Ohio and I do currently live in Cleveland (what makes you think I'm biased?). I remember when these videos came out and laughing at how spot on they were. To some extent they still are. HOWEVER. Things are looking up and a lot of new social places are opening up. We've getting back into the skyscraper phase with a nice hotel that'll hopefully be ready for the RNC (it will but nothing will work). And finally, if this nuCLEus project goes forward, it'll be interesting to see what else spawns from that. 

Will Cleveland ever return to status it used to have? No, least not in any reasonable time frame. It's cold and that's something we can't change and compete with. Cleveland does have a distinct advantage of not having to worry about natural disasters. So who knows, maybe in 300 years we'll be relevant again.I hope he's happy now, watching the world through his tiny little window.Plot twist, it's a broom closet.MedianerasMy dad used to know a guy that worked at the broadcast control room at the top of the CN Tower.  The room was all [concrete walls, blaring cooling fans, and TV signal displays.](http://www.roadwolf.ca/files/blogpics/CNTower/94538.jpg)  He said he was getting miserable, possibly S.A.D., from never seeing the sunlight.

So he asked management about installing a single porthole window.  He pressured them enough that they actually bothered to look into it, and they said it would cost $20,000, and that they were willing to pay for half if he paid for the other half.  Never did get the porthole installed.

Guy had some cool stories though.  Like [the Northeast Blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) - he said you could see the power rolling out from block to block - it didn't just all immediately shut off at once, it moved like a wave in the ocean.  Of course, he didn't have his camera.

He also got us in the CN Tower for free, through the basement security entrance, and we got to see the cool control room at the top of the tower that visitors can't see.  

EDIT: Since folks are interested, I'll share this cool photo:

But also for an entirely different reason--realizing this is /r/pics and not /r/aerodynamics, anyone not interested in aerodynamics turn back, move along, nothing to see here...

This is the first visualization in the natural world (i.e., not in a wind tunnel) I've come across that illustrates adverse yaw, the use of differential aileron to correct it, and the effect it exerts on the tracking of ""wake"" or wing tip vortices.  As anyone who has spent time near a major airport knows, the little whirlwinds that stream off wing tips or edges of flaps--and which the **[newish winglets](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/24/business/Why-Winglets.html?_r=0)** try to combat--descend after the plane has passed and can make a crackling noise or disturb the tops of trees when they descend to ground level.

If the pilot is skimming above cloud tops as in this photo, those vortices will descend behind the plane and the combined **[""downwash""](https://tianyizf1.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/trailing-vortex.jpg)** from where the tip vortices meet will disturb the clouds--that's why we only see one ""slice"" caused by the two tip vortices in this image, but **[this photo](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/downwash.html)** of a business jet penetrating just the tops of the clouds illustrates the two separate wing tip vortices.

However, if you look closely, notice that, as the aircraft banks to the right, the slice is displaced to the outside of the turn, to the left of the aircraft track.  The reason for this is asymmetric induced drag--the downward deflecting aileron that raises the left wing tip causes a momentary increase in what is known as induced drag.  Simply said, banking to the right makes the left wing tip vortex stronger than its counterpart on the right.  The increased lift caused by the lowered aileron causes that wing to pull up and back harder than the right wing is ""pulled"" down, whose aileron is up.

That increase in drag would tend to pull the nose of the aircraft to the left, towards the outboard wing, which is a bad thing from an aerodynamics stand point--it requires more rudder to maintain coordinated flight, and thus, more drag to overcome, so higher fuel costs.  So a concept called **[differential aileron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/DifferentialAileron.svg)** is employed to cause the inboard (right) wing to raise the aileron more than the outboard (left) wing lowers its aileron.  But here's the key: the raised aileron results in more drag, but largely in the form of separation drag--that's when the air doesn't flow smoothly over the upper wing surface, but starts to get more turbulent.  This disruption in airflow causes more drag to be generated across the wing, but keeps the amount of outward **[spanwise flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:Tip_vortex_rollup.png)**on the upper wing surface lower. Spanwise flow is responsible for initiating wing tip vortices and winglets attempt to minimize it. The end effect is the generation of a smaller wing tip vortex on the inboard wing.

We're in the home stretch: when the two wing tip vortices combine, one stronger, the other weaker, their interaction causes the net downwash of airflow in the wake of the aircraft to track toward the stronger wing tip vortex, and thus as they descend, will veer to the outside of the turn.  Furthermore, the bank angle of the aircraft will accentuate this effect, as the lateral force component of the stronger wing tip vortex will bias the downwash to the outboard side. This is what we can see clearly from this otherwise picturesque, very cool shot.

**TL;DR: Perfect visualization of induced drag in a turning aircraft which biases the downwash to the outside of the turn.**

NOTE: For the pilots and perfectionists here, though the pilot eases up on the yoke/stick input that initiated the turn after the bank angle is established, a little bit of inboard bank input is held to prevent the natural stabilizing effect that aircraft with dihedral experience, which requires more lift on the outboard wing to counter the increased upward lift component on the inboard, more horizontal wing, which still results in a differential in induced drag between wingtips.  These changes in control surface input during turns are responsible when you see **[strake/LEX and wing tip vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:FA-18C_vapor_LEX_and_wingtip_1.jpg)** appear during airshow demonstrations more prevalently as hard turns are initiated, which then dissipate/disappear when the pilot establishes bank angle and/or unloads.BEWARE!

Also, there was a big ass crocodile in the front yard.

-Dr. Seuss, the Croc in the YardGators gonna gait.Interior crocodile alligatorI posted this elsewhere in the thread, but hey, maybe it won't get buried if I try again.

Lowcountry South Carolina checking in: the biggest risk we run with gators here is the idiotic tourists who come down and think they're cool to fuck around with. I've literally seen tourists on banks and docks casting fishing lines trying to hit the gator with their bait, to agitate it. And worse, I've seen (and stopped) tourists approaching a seven-footer to try and feed it *Chick-Fil-A nuggets.* 

The problem is, if it happens enough times, the alligator will get used to receiving food from people. And then they start to see people and think ""food!"" And then they start to approach people. And then they think, this person is holding out on me, being all coy backing away instead of giving me my chicken nuggets! And then they follow the person, who perceives it as aggression.

You can't relocate an alligator; they've fought other gators for the right to whatever territory they live in and they *will come back.* They will come back.

It *ruins* an alligator when they begin to feel comfortable associating with humans. I don't know of a single state that actually ""removes"" alligators--relocation doesn't work. Nine times out of ten, any pest control or park service you call will end up euthanizing any gator they've received a complaint about.

Here's a series of articles about a 50 year old gator who caused some ruckus in my town last June:

* First, someone saw him and complained. So he was removed.
* [Then he came back](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/03/3143848/whopper-gator-found-hilton-head.html) to his original location
* Someone complained that he was relocated rather than killed, so [an investigation started](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/04/3146663/large-alligators-release-to-be.html)
* A resident said that the gator [wasn't aggressive](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/07/3151999/hilton-head-islander-speaks-up.html)
* But the pest control guy lost his contract with the city anyway and the 50 year old, 1000 pound gator was killed.
* Some people [didn’t think the guy should’ve lost his job](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/09/3203948/petition-supporting-gator-wrangler.html)
* That's when things got really interesting. Another alligator was hit by a car on one of our busy highways in town. The city, having just terminated their contract with the-guy-who-handles-this-sort-of-thing, didn’t have anyone to go and pick it up. So, over the next few hours and in the ensuing traffic jam, all of our tourists and residents were treated to a delightful viewing of this alligator’s slow death in the median. [Article](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/03/3195631/maffo-critter-management-lose.html)


So, here are some tips for next time you see an alligator during your vacation:

* Respect them. Take photos from a respectable distance.
* Do not approach or harass them. They are not in a glass tank and they are not here to entertain you--you do not need to interact with them.
* Do not pick up, approach or harass their babies. Alligator moms actually do stick around their young and nurture them.
* Take care to look after your own young children and pets, as those are the most likely things an alligator will mistakenly see as food.
* Please don't call animal control just because you *see* a gator. Only call animal control if the animal is behaving in an aggressive way, or approaching humans. Gators who are minding their own business don't deserve to be euthanized just for existing.
* For the love of god, do not attempt to feed them chicken nuggets.So what's the legal standpoint of shooting one that's in your yard?[Alligators are some scary shit.](http://i.imgur.com/wY5BZ.gif)

I don't play around with tools anymore, I rigidly stick to the safety instructions and refuse to use a tool without understanding it better first.

Could be a lot worse depending on the tool you're using.I work in a Cnc grind shop with few conventional machines and shit like this gives me nightmares.

Including blue and green, which you never see in a sunrise.You can't just choose the window seat.

/sorrynotsorryWindow seat is awesome. I can't even fall asleep on the plane ride because I'm too concentrated on staring out the window. Still fascinating no matter how many times I fly. 

The best ones are if the plane has a window exit. Fun fact, a lot of wide body aircraft say ""window exit"" but that seat actually has the window like 2-3 feet in front of the seat and maybe a foot behind it. So, tall people of reddit, make sure to ask if the exit seat actually has a window. Especially if you fly on a 777-300ER.

Source, I have worked for a couple airlines, that offer window exits that don't actually have a window.The Langoliers are coming.ITT: a bunch of tall people whining.

Getting old is weirdIs that the remains of the evil, green demon that crashes planes?I hadn't been on an airliner since before 9-11, but I had to take the short flight from Los Angeles to Oakland on Southwest at the New Year. I am a geologist so I try to get a window seat to look at the familiar features on the ground in California, the San Andreas fault and the various ranges and structures one can see, especially when the sun angle is low. So I could see things like the Kettleman Anticline and the strike ridges of the Great Valley Sequence on the west side of San Jouquin Valley as we flew north. When we got about 20 min. out of Oakland the plane started to descend into the clouds and I thought that the show was over, but then I noticed a white colored bow that appeared opposite the sun in the clouds with a white spot in its center that I judged to be exactly opposite the sun which was low in the sky. As looked, and this lasted only a minute or so, I could see the shadow of the aircraft appear in the spot. Then we got deeper into the clouds and the effect was lost. I was seeing a glory and it may be reasonably common. I may have seen one years ago when I flew to Europe. It pays to sit at a window seat.This picture is so beautiful and I want to cryYeah, but then I have to crawl over two people whenever I gotta pee and that's super annoying.

Theres another one called ""Evans & Peel - Detective Agency"". If you go in the front door there is just a man sitting at an old fashioned desk with a typewriter and stuff.

Visitors who don't know New York history sometimes assume it's all a carefully preserved green space from before the city existed, but that's not at all the case. Central Park was consciously conceived, laid out, and constructed beginning in the 1850s in response to the need for city-dwellers to have a place to ""escape"" to, and while it incorporated a few vacant spaces, much of it was reclaimed ground covered with temporary dwellings. Central Park is one of the great monuments to deliberate urban planning, most of it the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.

""She originally uploaded it to her National Geographic account here:

It also was featured in this Editors' Spotlight post:

It's fucking *massive*.How much would it cost to rent one of those townhouse looking homes?Central park is much bigger than I realized. 
Edit: spelling... New York is a magnificent. Hi Everyone! I am Kayte Dolmatch - the photographer of this image. I'd like to clear a few things up:
1) This is my image and only my image
2) The very first time this was posted anywhere was on my flickr page with my watermark on November 20th 2014. https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaytedolmatch/15647565470/in/album-72157627317857063/ 
3) I submitted the photo to National Geographic in August of 2015 as part of an assignment ""From Above"". National Geographic prefers users to upload images without a watermark so I removed the watermark on the file I uploaded to their site.
4) To my pleasant surprise my image was voted Top Shot on National Geographic Your Shot - which meant it got ""published"" on their instagram and their blog (tumblr). This is the unwatermarked version that people have been stealing and posting all over the internet.
5)I have no problem with my image being circulated as long as the proper credit is provided - I'm so pleased that so many are touched by this photograph and really enjoy it.
6) I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark III, which allows the artist to record their name as the artist on every single image taken with the camera - this is captured in the metadata. Also seen on my flickr link
7)If you are interested in purchasing a print of this image please feel free to contact me at kathleendolmatch@yahoo.com
8) Thank you for reading this. Have a lovely day

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that ""stealing"" is not the correct term and I agree. ""Sharing without citing""  would have been more accurate. My image has gone viral on multiple websites without proper citation and I was frustrated when I made my original post. By the way, the apartment building in the center of the image with the gray gabled roof and green features is The Dakota, where John Lennon lived and was killed. Directly across in the park is an area called Strawberry Fields.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DakotaI miss my home :(Central Park is what makes Manhattan bearable, in my opinion.

It is the epitome of the need for escape from the urban cityscape and into the greenery, surrounded by two of my favourite museums, a one stop shop for getting away from the craziness that can be the city.Just went to central park for the first time yesterday. I found it to be an absolute gem among the massive concrete jungle that is NYC. The fact that they planned this over a
150 years ago and no one has either tried or been able to develop that land into more monstrous buildings is amazing. Central Park is probably my favorite place on Earth besides my bedJust a little fun fact, the lake in central park was originally a water reservoir for the NYC water supply. In Rio De Janiero, Christ the redeemer and the favelas have an interesting juxtaposition as well.So much beauty on the left. So much money on the right.I love to find  interesting buildings in New York. Look them up on google earth. Then look at the history behind them. How busy is Central Park on an average day? I cant imagine it supporting all those people...I love living in L.A. and I think it just might be one of the best cities in the world, but I wanna visit New York one day!  It seems like an awesome place to live !I really need to get to NY with my camera one day :(The demarcation is unbelievable. You can go in five minutes from being overrun by people to basically being alone in a forest. Ah, must be where the biome changes.

While it is very beautiful and sweet smelling, its has the ability to escape its ornamental confines in vine form, and then establish itself in the wild, where its aggressive vines creep around the forest floor, choking and out-competing many native understory species. Furthermore, sizable trees have been killed by those creeping Wisteria vines. When these large trees are killed, it opens the forest floor to sunlight, which allows the Wisteria seedlings to grow and flourish even more. 

Also, anyone who wants to see a good list of invasive species that are often sold at garden centers you should *definitely* avoid planting in your yard (depending on your zone), see [THIS LIST](http://imgur.com/a/PCLez) I made. If anyone DOES want to plant Wisteria, I would recommend [American Wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria_frutescens), which is just as beautiful, but does not have the invasive predisposition the Asian varieties do. The reason the Asian varieties are favored in ornamental application is because they emit a very intoxicating fragrance, while American Wisteria does not.

ITT: Michiganders and slightly confused and disgruntled New Yorkers>Coney Islands are a unique type of Greek American restaurant. Two of the most well-known Coney Island restaurants are the Lafayette Coney Island and the American Coney Island, which are located adjacent to one another on Lafayette St. in downtown Detroit. They have a common root, with the original restaurant having been established by Greek immigrant brothers Bill and Gus Keros in 1914. The brothers got into business dispute soon thereafter, and in 1917 split their restaurant into the two establishments that exist today.

>The menu of all Coney Island restaurants centers on the Coney Island hot dog, which is a natural casing hot dog in a steamed bun dressed with chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard. This item is usually referred to simply as a ""coney."" Another popular item on most Coney Island restaurant menus is the ""loose hamburger,"" which consists of crumbled ground beef in a hot dog bun, covered in the same condiments as a Coney Island hot dog. Many Coney Islands also serve ""chili fries,"" which are french fries covered in chili, sometimes with mustard or cheese added.

>Many Coney Islands offer other Greek and Greek-American dishes, such as Gyros, Souvlaki, Shish Kebab, Spanakopita, Saganaki, and Greek salads, as well as usual American diner fare, such as regular hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, and desserts.

TILThis is the place at 6 and Haggerty, right?ITT: Coney 2015You have a Coney Island?From Michigan, outside of Detroit, still blows me away no one else in the world knows what a coney island is. This place runs on Coney Islands.

Edit: Glad to hear these are popping up elsewhere. I'm just used to puzzled looks when I mention a coney outside of the areaI'm so excited to see a post about Coney's on the front page! Also so cool to see the interest from non-Michiganders. I grew up in the Detroit area where they are everywhere however I'm in Lansing now and there are only a few.

The most important things a coney must have, to me, are as follows:

1. You can get both Detroit and Flint style.
2. The place is a little gritty (which is why I prefer Lafayette over American, the atmosphere in there is amazing)
3. Someone working there has to be speaking (or yelling) Greek. If they are, you know the place is legit.
4. Bonus points if they have Vernor's and Boston Coolers (basically a ginger ale ice cream float)
5. Saganaki is always a bonus (OPPA!)

Cheers to all my fellow coney  connoisseurs![deleted]I just talked to the owner of this restaurant for a news story about this. What a sweet man! He told me that he lived on a farm in Greece with seven brothers and sisters, and his parents couldn't afford to send him to school. He left home when he was 12 and went to Athens, where he was homeless, and depended on the kindness of others to give him food. He said he does this every year because ""It makes my heart feel good to do it, and help a little bit."" This has to be metro Detroit. Not aware of any other place on earth with Coneys. [deleted]This guy understands real life. Good job Coney Island guy.**#Coney2015**""...my local Coney Island""?

As a New Yorker, this is confusing. That's really nice and all. But I am a national Coney Island man. Give me a hani and cheese fries as my last meal. And the answer to the big question is Lafayette. I'm thinking of going... I have no kitchen and everyone else is working that day.I need this where I live.

http://imgur.com/I3A3CC0,rm8HPW4#0Now all we need is someone from reddit to draw Lisa utilizing all of the no's.I just finished studying animation and even on our final student films the directors of each project were encouraged to make sheets like this. Our teams were really tiny, only 5 or 6 people a project, but when you have multiple people animating on a film, all with their own distinct styles and artistic background, it's pretty easy for inconsistencies to happen unless you really peg things down! 

Even in a small team like ours, the style guide basically became like our bible during the project, I can't imagine what it'd be like in larger teams, if style guides weren't there! I love seeing ones from other series though, some of the do's and don't's are really interesting, things you wouldn't notice/think about otherwise It takes a little while to hammer out all these kinks and standardize the art style across the animation team. If you want to see an example of some of these errors in play, check out the first season of Family Guy, there are a few errors, but one that immediately comes to mind is the cutaway where Peter thinks Philadelphia with Tom Hanks is a comedy. When the POV switches from zoomed out to closeup, someone didnt scale the eyes correctly, so for a part of the scene Peter's eyes are huge As an animator, seeing everyone's reaction to something that is super common in the industry is cool. It's like ""oh ya, what I do is pretty cool""I played around with the image to see what was written on the back. Here are my results (someone more skilled would do better):

that secret door doesn't look so secretDidn't realize the wooden floor looked like that. All you ever see in photos is the carpet with the presidential seal.

Is this done for cleaning, or what? Because every president since Kennedy has used the same desk and carpet.

As a nurse I work with a lot of patients who are terminally ill and frequently I'll ask them what were the most memorable moments in their life. 9/10 times people will mention family or memorable moments like these. Never once have I had a patient mention money or personal possessions as the highlight of their life. It's the little things in life that matters, make them count.The most simple pleasures of life can mean a lot to some. Doctor here. This is the way it should be. Dying with dignity versus the medical torture we sometimes use to prolong the inevitable. Love the joy on her face. Congratulations to her for a long life. This is such a touching pic.  It brought both tears to my eyes as well as happiness seeing that smile on her face.  She looks like the Grandma everyone would want around them.  Sending big hugs to you and your gram.Wat.When my uncle came home from hospital to die (he didn't want to stay in the hospice, so his wife and my mother cared for him during his final 3 weeks. His bed was set up in the sitting room, his view out the window was onto the mountain range in our area. He woke up to the sun rising every morning over it. During the day and in the evenings his bed was wheeled out into the kitchen so he could be there with his family and be beside the stove. He could lie there and look out the double doors onto the bay. The view from the kitchen over the bay is unbelievable, many people at the funeral in the house were amazed at it. 
Before his remains left the house to go to the church we faced him towards the sea one last time. Something I believe would have put a smile on his face. Happy watFuck yeah grandson! Not only are you sharing that fantastic day with her, and making her final desires a reality, you are there. And her face shows the joy and wonder of the setting and experience with you! 

To this day I regret missing my stepfathers final days, due to work commitments and travel constraints. All in all bullshit rationalizations. I just missed his death by @ 6 hours. Regret not being there just to say goodbye, hold his hand and thank him for everything he was to me. So kudos, it's hard to watch it happen, but being there for our loved ones is soul work. It is our responsibility and great honor to help them pass from this world to...

Edit: For assumptions about OP's gender!Is this San Diego?

As someone who works in SD in some palliative/ home hospice care settings please listen to me when I say

You're all doing the right thing for her. HOSPICE DOES NOT MEAN YOURE GIVING UP ON SOMEONE. 

Edit: a wordHer joy is breathtaking. I have never loved a photo as much as I love this one!This totally looks like Laguna Beach. We need closure, op!I hope you grandma goes peacefully, remembering wonderful moments like this one.My G'ma knew her time was near and wouldn't my wedding so I made her her favourite dinner and proposed to my wife in front of her so she could be a part of our wedding [Dignity](http://i.imgur.com/XGIr4do.jpg)This made my heart smileI love this so much. I'm a geriatric nurse and its sad the number of elderly people who don't have family or don't have family who care enough to do things like this for them. You guys are awesome :)Op, was that wheelchair rented or how did you find it?  I may be trying to take my mother-in-law to see the beach for the first time next year and worry about her walking on the sand.

Thanks.

NeatIce.... Cave... under a Volcano?... sounds like a death trap.This reminded me there was some pseudo-scence attempt in some website somewhere to explain how dragons would be and they were apparently made of carbon fiber that would allow them to have hollow bones like birds, so they'd be light without losing durability to allow flying. They'd have a sack of methane or some gas in their stomach which they would spark with a specialized lighter-like organ in their throat that would allow it to breathe fire.

Interesting.Note to self: find a desert map for Cities Skyline.Those look to be the upper middle class suburbs, they tend to be on the outskirts of Vegas away from the strip since they overlook the desert mountains. High schools get built onto empty dirt lots and homes surround the area. Unfortunately, most of these homes get built around the outer edges more and more each year with less and less people buying them out. I'm only 23 and most of my friends have been able to *buy* these homes at this age from how cheap they are. I'm a Vegas Native and I can safely say this is only a specific view of suburban Vegas life. I'd even say Vegas has many different kinds of suburban looks since the city keeps growing immensely every year.

*edit from mobile* so thanks to savvy Vegas friends below this has been identified as the Aliante portion of Vegas, which is definitely a way nicer suburb of Vegas. I didn't meant to imply that these homes are foreclosing, but lots of neighborhoods that look like this one nearby are affordable to younger folks like me. Looks like future mars.Nuketown[deleted]Made of ticky tacky.Question for those that have lived in Vegas.

 In my many trips to Vegas I've noticed that most of the neighborhoods have brick walls built around them, why is that?Reminds me of ""The Goldfinch"".  [deleted]Lots of comments from people saying Vegas sucks. I've been out here 10 years. It's fine. Every city sucks if you're looking for reasons for it to. It's just like any other place. Many of the complaints apply to any major city. Drivers suck, drug problems, crime, people are ""fake"" blah blah blah. I don't drink, do drugs, party, etc anymore. I have a decent career and life out here in this ""party town"". It's all about how you look at it. I think the desert is beautiful. Yeah, it gets hot as hell. It's a desert. We also don't have to shovel snow. This winter was cold for like a week in late December. Other than that, nothing more than a light jacket was ever needed. 

All of that being said, don't raise kids here unless you can put them in private school. Clark County schools are atrocious. Even if they graduate high school (~30% won't), the curriculum is so weak that they will still be at a disadvantage. Especially in an out of state university.

I have desert landscaping. Grass is dumb in the desert. Even outside of being a waste of water and contributing to the humidity, it just doesn't look right in the middle of the desert. I sure as shit don't want to be outside cutting the grass when it's 115 degrees out.This looks exactly like the homes in Las Ventura's in San Andreas in GTA: San Andreas.I live there. AMAI live in a similar neighborhood on the south west end of Las Vegas.  It's kind of nice and weird knowing that across the street there is literally nothing but desert for hundreds of miles.https://www.google.com/maps/@36.3090064,-115.1967351,1475m/data=!3m1!1e3

Ah, this picture reeks of corporate interests and government unwillingness to stand up against the corporations. Notice how the colour of the area outside the suburbs is faded, signifying the death throes of Mother Nature herself. The grey, uniform tops of the houses signify the victory of the corporate agenda and the defeat of the common person, who is now powerless to stop the overreach of the 1%.Looks just like my sim city. If you've got a good set of illegal binoculars, you can even see those dastardly fools over in Desert Bluffs.This is right next to Shadow Ridge High School. I bought my car from a guy near here.Reddit is weird. Space colonies are the future but trying to live in the desert is arrogant and unsustainable.Ahh a good case study for gridding in Cities Skyline.Honestly this does not look so bad.

I would rather grow up there than my own city.

Imagine being an 8-14 year old kid there with a giant desert behind your house to explore, build bike trails, jumps and just wander.

also there is an airport near on the bottom left corner to watch planes land and take off.

Then at 16 with a summer job and saving up allowances I'd get a small dirtbike to tour around in the desert.

Seriously, this place looks 10x better than growing up in other cities where you are locked in on 4 sides with shitty bylaws setup by old women city councilors.

Where I used to work, they had just started producing these. They're incredibly expensive to transport. My company spent a quarter of a billion dollars on logistics for wind blades last year.

I'll be super excited if it works out.The speed makes me *shutter*This is growing more common around the world, it's impressive but at the same time, somewhat less remarkable if you live in a country with high speed trains (most European countries, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea etc.) Kind of sad how little attention this great technology is getting in North America.

Too much air pressure?

meanwhile the train I take to NYC every day goes 60 mph and you have to keep a tight grip on your laptop so it doesn't go flying. We have literally had ZERO improvement to our railway system in 50 years.

I was once employed by DirecTV, which claims exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package. Each year, the top seller of the Sunday Ticket package in each DirecTV call center was given some recognition and award by the NFL. It so happens that a friend of mine (Jason) won for our call center and the prize for that year was to fly out for a weekend trip on location for the filming of an advertisement for Sunday Ticket.  Mr. Manning was being featured in the ad and all of the award recipients and their guests were to do a meet and greet with him during filming. I asked Jason if he would be willing to take a football card and have it signed, to which he agreed.

When Jason returned from the trip, he presented me with the signed card (personalized to me) and told me about his meeting with Mr. Manning. He said there were something like twenty people that had gone on the trip, and that Mr. Manning had apparently requested small bios of all of those who we're coming to the meet and greet. When they arrived, he addressed each of them by name and talked with every one of them personally about their lives and thanked them all for their efforts to help market the NFL, etc. He also joked around with all of them while he was filming the ad and was just generally very personable and great.

Since having learned about the events of that trip, I have always had a high opinion of Mr. Manning, feeling that his treatment of those in attendance was far above what many players would offer in a similar circumstance.

TL;DR - Peyton Manning treats a bunch of fans very well during a meet and greet.I like that he took the time to fill in the ""r"" in ""Mr"" before his signature.When PM was in his final year in Indy during the injury season, some family friends would see him before the game pull into the players lot in his car before the game as they tailgated across from the entrance. (One time he even rolled down his window and jokingly asked for a hotdog.)

During the final home game of the year, after seeing the same die hard group there through every game in that season where the Colts went 2-14, he approached the group before the game unsolicited and thanked them for their support during the long year and posed with some pictures at their tailgate spot.

He will always be my favorite athlete of all time, and even though we are set up better for the future with Andrew Luck, I miss Peyton every time I see him play.I'm pretty sure Ryan Leaf is available.Plot twist: OP's sister's fiancee is Eli Manning.Peyton is all class.What an idiot. He's forgetting that weddings usually have open bars and attractive young women It’s like is is quoting himself. “Best wishes” - Peyton Manning. From Peyton Manning.

Legit question: 

How does lightning strike from a volcano cloud? I've only ever seen lightning in the clouds from the sky, before, so this is a new concept to me. How am I supposed to get all the way up there with just this stupid ring and my stupid midget buddies?

""Who disturbs my slumber?""Shit like this is why ancient civilizations believed in cool gods.OMG I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

Okay, fun fact about Venus, the atmosphere is to thick and hot for rain, so when it rains sulfuric acid on venus it evaporates a few km above the surface.

But there is lightning? Lightning on earth comes with rainstorms, but the lack of rainstorms on venus means that the lightning  comes from the volcanic ash buildup in the atmosphere.This is WILD. High quality pics post right here. Quetzalcoatl returnsHolly shit!!! I never thought I'd see something from my hometown on reddit. I use to live less than 10 miles from this volcano. That belongs on a heavy metal album.Shit, I would have never imagined seeing my little state on reddit's frontpage.Kalimaaaaa? Am I saying that right?'Guys, I said, *don't* let the avatar get on top of the mountain!'When I visit *la familia*, this volcano is visible from the *Capilla* which sits on the road which leads down to the village. It's only slightly visible on the clearest of days, but the fucker is imposing once you notice it.

It induces a kind of existential angst at the same time as the land above creates a kind of awe.Good job, babe! *friendly butt squeeze*

Did you work with Brian Wells?I see Homer is enjoying his ox testicle.[From last year's trip](http://i.imgur.com/PSVxuJC.png)I had one of the earlier animators for Simpsons work in my office for years a while back. He would draw some of the funniest pictures I've seen and leave them everywhere.Doing small things like this can cause a surprisingly large amount of amazement. Things like these small hidden gems can make someone's entire week, even if you don't know it.The key to making Homer look drunk it seems is to make his eyes point in slightly different directions.2 years ago, he offered to ""Simpsonise"" people. Would he still be willing to do this with a picture of my daughter for me? I'd be eternally grateful!Is this just your natural talent, or have you also had formal art education? 



Do you any original characters you have come up with? 



is there a rule against impromptu ama-ing someone? This is beyond awesome. Having an original drawing like that would surely embiggen the smallest man.
It's nice to see event he professionals starts off with the rudimentary circles break down before drawing in the details. [Fun fact, Marge's head and hair is exactly 3 equally sized circles tall.](http://i.imgur.com/Y28pW3C.jpg)This pic just makes me really remember how way out of his league Marge is. I'm surprised you didn't go to the Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary. I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year.I've never seen Homer's feet before. I didn't know it would look like elephant's feet.My dad was an animator on the Simpsons! Do you know Tuck Tucker?


He also does little things like this. Most of his life he worked on Hey Arnold and Spongebob, so it's more often that he will be asked to draw one of those than a Simpson's character. He's from a small town in Virginia, so whenever we visit, everyone crowds him in public hoping for a personalized drawing. He's like a local celebrity! He also does little doodles for my roommates and friends for their birthdays. It's such a fun skill to have!I wish I knew how to go be an animator,  it's my dream career. I live in the middle of nowhere and I feel like I can't leave.  >doodle

What an understatement! You know, I'd really love it if Alex could Simpsonize me one time...Oh...Oh wait. Hey you!  This is awesome.Thank fuck you're back. I have a ridiculous story and video to tell/show you. Only you will feel my pain. When I was about 11, I found that I could draw a really shitty Bart.  I proudly doodled him everywhere.  I would flip over paper place mats at restaurants and doodle Bart with a speech bubble saying things like ""This place rocks!"" or ""Cowabunga dude!"".  I strode out of those restaurants with just a little more kid swagger than I had before I could doodle Bart.Marge keepin' it tight.I remember my dad showing me a graphic artist named Alex Ruiz who he made a book for a couple years ago (company name is UBuildABook) , is this the same Alex Ruiz?If they're smart they'll frame a copy.

Original photo by John Vachon, a photographer of the Farm Security Administration.

[""Negro tenant farmer, rehabilitation client. Jefferson County, Kansas"", 1938.](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1997003700/PP/)


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration):


>Initially created as the Resettlement Administration (RA) in 1935 as part of the New Deal in the United States, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was an effort during the Depression to combat American rural poverty.


>The FSA stressed ""rural rehabilitation"" efforts to improve the lifestyle of sharecroppers, tenants, very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture — that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.
Fallout looking motherfucker.It somebow bring the distant past into the present. Awesome work. Does anyone know a good online repository for such work? Jefferson County, KS has an average annual rainfall of ~38 inches. In 1938, they got 10.5"". I seriously doubt it was this green. It was called the ""dustbowl"" for a reason.  Crooks is looking goodWe don't say ""colorized"" anymore.  You ""African Americanized"" this photo. Outstanding. Best example of this type of work that I have ever seen.Color me impressed. He looks like a black J.k Simmons. Great job on the colourisation! Are you sure he was black I would desaturate the blue sky and green trees, because, you know: The depression. fucking well donethis is one of the best colorizations ive ever seenAnd he's only 19!Looks like a screenshot of a Fallout 4 NPC to me.Nothing to add, I stumbled upon this post on /r/all.

I just want to say that I am impressed by the result. I didn't imagine that colors could add *so much* to a photo.
