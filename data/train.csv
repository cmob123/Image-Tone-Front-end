He died protecting priceless antiquities from destruction, something he definitely believed in.  Sad for him to die but certainly honorable for him to die with his convictions.The man was 82 years old and brave as fuck. RIP.This is so heartbreaking. His love for the Palmyra Antiquities surpassed his love for his own life.

I hope that wherever he goes, he's rolling in antiquities and unbelievable treasures.  Here's a story. 

The New York Times: ISIS Beheads Syrian Antiquities Scholar. http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5JqtgyU...why can't the entire world be more successful against ISIS... the news about them is always so frustrating and infuriatingIt breaks my heart so much history is being destroyed. Especially since that area (Iraq, Iran, etc) is literally like the cradle of civilization and there's SO MUCH priceless stuff there. It's truly a terrible thing.When you feel threatened by ancient monuments, dead gods and archeologists, you're in the wrong and so is your ideology.[This is Tomislav Salopek, 31, father of two, Croatian] (http://static.klix.ba/media/images/vijesti/b_150813104.jpg), beheaded by ISIS a week ago, because, well, ISIS likes to behead peopleRIP Khaled Assad. You died a more honorable man than those who killed you. Thank you khaled. You're a hero to history.Most news stories failed to say why he was murdered. The man was a hero who sacrificed himself to protect his lifetime of work. 

It's long passed time for the surrounding Muslim countries, who have millions of soldiers in their armies, to come together and put an end to these monsters once and for all.  I know Isis are shitheads but why do they destroy ancient buildings and antiques?R.I.P. man of ethics and morality.Perhaps some of the powerful sovereigns in regions **SHOULD STEP THE FUCK UP** and save their culture and history before it's wiped out by these assholes.


It's hard for me to be upset about this anymore.

I'm absolutely shocked at the loss of priceless history and the barbarism to kill this man over this, but if no one in the Middle East wants to stop ISIS, then I say the West should pull out, and let them have their cake.

There's no way we, with a foreign modern military, can go into a region like the Middle East and solve these problems by killing people.

Our foreign military can support and assist in a force led by a local sovereign, but we cannot lead a war over there and come out the winner, nor accomplish anything effective.

People have the right to self determination. If those people in the territory now controlled by ISIS, and those sovereigns around them want to allow ISIS sovereign control, so be it.**NEW GAME:** No more need to hunt and kill secondary game like lions and rhinos.  It's time to drop all of the poachers into ISIS territory armed to the teeth and wearing GoPros with instructions to bring back their heads as trophies.  Poach for your life baby!Fuck You ISIS!Wow.

RIP.As a historian I am really feeling that it is time for us to organize and begin seriously defending these sites. This man died with honor. I hope he finds peace. Will somebody plz take out those piece of shit fucktards? I hope if I ever face my own death like that I can have half the balls this guy did and tell them fuck right off. This guy is a hero and died as honorable a death as any man could hope for, die protecting and defending what you love and lived for.I was talking with a lot of redditors yesterday trying to understand how ISIS is able to recruit and hold so much control if seemingly no one supports them. 

The common answer from Muslims was that ""more Muslims support ISIS than are willing to admit it publicly"".  And that ""even if they don't actively support them, they tacitly support them by secretly agreeing with their actions"". 

That was concerning to me, and as much as I hate to agree with GW Bush, I can kind of start to see the logic of his ""If you aren't with us, you're against us"" comment. 

Seeing people like this man, get beheaded for such a noble cause kind of highlights for me how terribly evil this group is.  If you even *remotely* support what these people are doing, fuck you. 

This truly is a point in time where everyone needs to clearly pick a side. This is the kind of shit that we as a society can't tolerate. I guess real life is not like a movie. I wonder if he spent his last seconds wondering if someone would come to save him. I hate when good people have to die like this. fucking savages

RIP, real manAlpha as Fuck. ISIS - Tell us where you have the shit hid. Kahled - Fuck You.
I hope that I would have the Balls to protect my life's work.It's tragic that it often takes such villains to show us who the heroes are.

I caused the death of spider today and I've not been able to shake the whole ordeal from my head.

You see, I was driving in my car and I see something in my peripheral vision. It's a huge golden orb-weaver. A BANANA SPIDER! He's on my window, the inside, and he's looking at me and I'm looking at him and the cop behind me is looking at both of us and wondering why I'm not driving because the light is now green.

I rolled down my window but that didn't do any good. Spider just hopped down to my arm rest. Too close for comfort. I open my door a little bit but Spider can't take a hint.

WHOOP WHOOOOOOP. The cop is now pulling us over. I turn into a near by parking lot, spider clumsily bolts out of my car via the rolled down window, officer approaches my vehicle and says ""What're you doing, son?!"", I hear a crunch.

What do all the buttons and levers do? Couple years ago when my son was a toddler he was obsessed with garbage trucks, absolutely in love with them.  Every Friday morning we would sit on the balcony of our 3rd story apartment and watch the big ole WM truck come empty out the dumpsters and my son was just captivated, no matter how many times he had seen them before.

Now my parents lived in a little town about 35 minutes away, and we would visit them at least once a week.  My folks are oddly generous and every week when the garbage men come through their neighborhood my mom will go out there and give them all cold bottles of water, gatorade or soda.  Its just a little thing that has endeared my parents to the garbage men.  

Well just so happens that my sons 3rd bday fell on whatever day of the week was garbage day in my folks neighborhood.  While we were at their house the garbage truck comes rumbling along.  I ran out there as my mom was getting them their drinks and explained that my son just loved the shit out of garbage trucks and offered them $20 to let us have a little ride around the neighborhood.  

The driver refused the money but took us around the neighborhood anyway.  I gave the money to his partner and told him to go have a few rounds on me after work.   For the next year everytime they saw my son and I they would give us a ride, all in all we had 3 ride alongs.   

There's not really a point to this story, other than OPs pic brought back one of my favorite memories of all time.  My son was so god damn excited, but also felt pretty special, which of course made my week.I see ""JAG OFF"" stickers...Pittsburgh? Do you like your job? I've been thinking about being a garbage man. What cool stuff have you found?i'm not sure if you're aware of this...but both of my children LIVED for garbage day when they were small.  they would loose it when they heard the truck and we would run out (no matter what state we were in) to stand on the porch and watch.  we would always say hello and chat briefly with the guys.  (never a lady on my route).  so i'm not sure if you know, but you are ACTUAL heros to many kids out there.  they love you.  what's in the bag?This guy has GOT TO BE from Pittsburgh. The ""jag off"" is strong in this truck...

That and ""the shocker""...So instead of giving my trash men beer for the holidays, I should just give them cool stickers for the inside of the truck? I can do that.""Stay Drunk."" Probably not the best sticker to have in your truck. How comfortable is it sitting in there?
lots of people like to think their jobs are important but aren't.  If I didn't go to work for a week who would care?  realistically....no one.  If a garbage man didn't go to work for a week....FUCKING CHAOS.[removed]what country? i used to work as a garbagetruckman in sweden and ours were a whole lot more modern than that, also ended up making them personalized, not so much with stickers but with other things.

remember hooking up a stereo-speaker system to the rear and connecting it to the musicplayer so we didnt miss the song/the radio speaker when getting off to work.

you make surprisingly much as a garbageman in sweden too. i made roughly twice the national average a month from the garbageman job and i finished so early i could have a second part-time job after. worked between 6-10 (rouhly, we got off work when finished with our route, also sometimes had slightly earlier hours) and then had a second work starting at 1pm.

ironically you end up making almost three times swedens national average as a garbageman that way, which is fun because everyone treats you as if you're below them somehow, if only they knew.

also, note to americans, we make very little money in sweden (made up for by a lot of things being ""free"" etc) so the national average monthly salary is ""just"" 2500 a month, however this is enough to have a lower middleclass lifestyle, so it is comparable with ""a lot"" more by US standard of salary.

however, if you have a high paying job in sweden (4000 usd +) you would be better off as an american, as the swedish system is less rewarding when you succeed but gives you more room to succeed.

anyway, just my story.

tl;dr

garbagemen can make 6000+ usd monthly, where as swedens national average is 2500 usd monthly.You from Pittsburgh? We're going to the cup ya JagHaha love the Edelbrock and Summit stickers, now I'm imagining a garbage truck with a scoop and dual 4 barrel high-rise carbs tearing ass through the neighborhood scaring all the children./r/garbagetruckporn I'm surprised they let you decorate it so much like that.

Basically a strongly emitting source of radiation is kept in a chamber with tubes leading through the chamber. Vials of samples get pushed into the chamber with an air shuttle kind of arrangement so they can get irradiated for analysis.

While the core of the reactor is housed in a heavy lead vessel, the rest of the reactor is made of cement with iron slugs used as aggregate instead of gravel. The iron chunks don't stop gamma emission as well as lead, but they do a better job than gravel.

One day, several trucks of cement were scheduled to begin casting of the walls of the core. The prof strenuously advised the construction foreman to only fill the trucks 1/3 full because the iron slugs would be considerably more dense than the aggregate they usually use. The foreman ignored the warnings, chalking them up as being the prattlings of an old naggy man and didn't give any orders to short fill the trucks. 

The trucks departed the cement plant charged with cement and iron aggregate and suffered eventual failure of all of their tires on the highway. They got stuck there loaded up with their massive overburdens of iron aggregate cement until their drum motors and bearings failed and the cement set inside the drums. They had to cut the drums apart off of the trucks  with plasma torches and jackhammers to clear up the heavy mess.Got any more details on location?

Walk of shameThis reminds me of my old 'triever, Ben. Like most of 'em he loved water, even when he was reeeally old.

We went to house sit for some friends in Dorset (UK) when he was about 12 and cracking on a bit (actually lasted till 16 bless him). One day I took him and my much younger german shepherd Sadie for a walk, and we came across this sort of drainage ditch/ stream that was about as deep as I am tall and about the same distance across, so pretty deep and steep. Ben smells the water and, with a speed I didn't realise he was still capable of, decides to clamber down to it. He sank up to his belly in mud. I went in after him and tried to haul him out but the sides were too high - the best I could do was hold him in my arms against the side of the ditch so he didn't sink any deeper. We were good and stuck.

The antics of my frantic younger dog and my panicked shouts eventually attracted the attention of another dog walker, and I begged her to go back to where we were staying, about half a mile away, and get my mum. She headed off after tying Sadie to the bridge over the ditch for me.

I waited for what seemed like hours, probably about half an hour, up to my calves in pretty cold mud, covered in more mud and a copious amount of hair, holding an exhausted dog. I was wearing a sundress, so my arms and legs were covered in scratches as well. 

Suddenly, firemen! My mum had called them after hearing the description of the ditch. I have never been so happy to see firemen. In minutes they had placed Ben into a large tarp and hauled him out of there and pulled me out. Mum and Ben got a lift back in the fire engine but they couldn't fit me and Sadie, and I was pretty much a mud person by then. I didn't want to ruin my shoes so I ended up walking back barefoot with a frantic germen shepherd stepping all over my feet on a gravel road with no pavement.

By the time I got back my mum had made the firemen (must have been about 8 of them at least) cups of tea. She then got the hose out to start hosing Ben down and the bastard started running around the garden to get away from the water with all the energy of a dog half his age.

The firemen did offer to pressure hose me but I declined.

TWA fell on hard times and people abandoned them for fear they would lose their frequent flyer miles.  

However, to keep people from jumping ship, they gave you an upgrade card that let you upgrade to first class without trading in any miles or paying any fee if you flew 30,000 miles per year, which I did each year.  I stuck with them to the bitter end  because it meant I flew everywhere first class for the price of a coach ticket.

One night, I was flying JFK to SFO, cross country, and the stewardess came to me with 4 movies and asked me which one I wanted to see.  I told her I was just going to sleep during the flight and to ask another passenger.

You guessed it: no other passengers.  747 plane with a full crew.  It was a sad day.  I asked her why they didn't just cancel the flight and she said they needed the plane in SF the next day.

This is a sculpted rocking chair made in the fashion of famous furniture designer Sam Maloof, but with modifications to the design.
This modified version is designed and made by Hal Taylor (@HalTaylor_Rocks on IG).  
If you visit Hal's web page, this chair actually holds a very special and highly hypocritical back story.  You see, one of Hal's former apprentices once asked if he could use this design to make for himself, to which Hal said ""fuck no"".  The apprentice made one anyway and Hal was all ""argggghhhhh"".  Then Hal went on making reproduction Sam Maloof chairs for a living, just as he had before.
Edit:  Hal's web address.  http://www.haltaylor.com The store I'm referring to is at the bottom of the home page.  I'm not really trying to shit talk him, as Hal Taylor is easily one of the best chair makers in the country of this fashion (Maloof reproductions).

I have a feeder outside my home-office, and its dominated by a single Hummingbird, and ""sometimes"" allows others nearby to feed from it.

Best work distraction since Reddit...Amazing job. Finally a good post. Quality and genius. Such cool birds. They're so fast and mechanical in their movements, like little flying robots. PROTIP: Throw a pack of red bee balm seeds in a corner of your yard by your windows. They absolutely go apeshit for red bee balm. We've been enjoying them for the last 3 summers in a row, as bee balm is a perennial.

Zero maintenance.Very cool pic. I love the stitched time lapse type of photos.

However, I am now irrationally afraid of being ventilated by tiny bug-birds.Hummingbirds mostly look at our feeder and then fly away. I realized tonight it's at least partly because we look intently at them whenever they come by. What can we do for more hummingbird action?!That's a beautiful image.

>It started while Kaszlikowski was shooting the upcoming documentary K2 Touching the Sky. He wanted a personal project to occupy his downtime during the weeks-long filming schedule, so he sent his DJI Phantom on a recon mission to scout shooting locations. The drone scoped out places around Concordia, the area below K2 where the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers converge. Kaszlikowski spotted a section of glacier that was melting away, creating a dramatic clone-like structure and a picturesque miniature river.

>“The place was special, making a very clean graphic frame,” he says. “It was disappearing, melting, changing its form every day. It was quite obvious nobody will photograph it again like me; nobody will see it the same way the next season.”

Here's a summary on the shot and the [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/david-kaszlikowski-k2-glacier/)Higher resolution mirror wallpaper [Link](https://i2.wp.com/www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/033.jpg) (2200 x 1352)Looks like where you'd find an Ice-Type Legendary.This clears up some issues of what why it looks like that: 

*The Polish photographer and a guide trekked to the spot at night to create a strange but vivid image that looks like it might be an alien planet. He used a 30-second exposure shot with a Canon 5D Mark III on a tripod. While the shutter was open, he “painted” the water and surrounding area with an LED, creating an eerie glow on the ice and sky. Although he was there during the summer, the temperature still drops to a frosty 5 degrees Fahrenheit up there at 16,000 feet, so his hands were plenty cold while working.*

*The final image plays tricks with size and scale, and the foreground doesn’t provide many clues. Although the bend in the river is 65 feet wide, the mountains in the background are some of the highest in the world. The region includes K2, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum I and II—all of them topping 26,000 feet.*Needs a Yeti.I'm going to need a gold Chocobo.Looks like the pool with the moon spirits in the northern water tribe in avatarThe boundaries between reality and sci-fi are now blurred more than everI'd love to check out what kind of rocks are in there. i thought it was a 3d model at firstAnd then [these motherfuckers](https://i.imgur.com/kogRcW0.jpg) trod everywhere through it.This was not* a ""drone"", it was an rc helicopter (or [radio controlled multirotor helicopter](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom) ).

Well, in the end the dog was following us around with his frisbee, trying to engage everyone to play. ""Beware of Dog... kisses""He got a tongue and he will use it!Aww I wanna cuddle the cute doggy The sign isn't for you. 

It's for him.

Because he's like Superman. Always has to watch his strength or he could hurt someone.

*Beware of dog*/r/blopSeriously though, beware of any dog you don't know. 

Too many people think ""lookit the liddle blep! I'mma poke it!"" Suddenly, you're in the dog's space and he's defensive, and the dog gets put down instead of the asshole who didn't beware of the fucking dog. 

90% of dogs would be okay with a pet in that situation. 10% would not. Don't risk it. Sadly this is probably for insurance purposes. Most companies ask what type of dog you have and if it belongs to one of the groups they feel are an issue they will ask if your yard is fenced and if you have a sign. This keeps your premiums from going up much higher than if you didn't have a sign or fence. Some municipalities also require it as well. I have several GSD's and my insurance agent about died when I exclaimed I didn't intend to fence my entire property. I told him they're all trained and won't hurt anyone unless commanded to. They didn't like that and tried to raise my rates so I just moved to a better carrier.""As long as you throw the ball, no one will get hurt"" Hey, that looks like my dog.

http://imgur.com/a/LyoL6He's a dangerous dog. A very dangerous dog. Yes he is. Oh yes he is. Aren't you boy? Oh yes you are.BloopWhat kind of dog?Reminds me of a dog my roommates used to own. 

It was a miniature dachshund, I think her breed were known for being particularly nasty but this dog was the sweetest thing. 

She loved everything and everyone except one thing: The doorbell, her dreaded enemy. 

The doorbell going off was one of the few times we heard her bark. This dog was about 6-7 pounds at most but when she barked she sounded like she was the size of a husky.

It was the funniest thing, watching canvassers ring the bell and get this look of complete horror when the heard the barking. The look on their faces when they saw it was coming from a mini-dachshund was priceless.Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!I had a Siberian Husky that looked like a wolf. He was built like a machine, and looked ferocious, which was nice because I lived in a place kind of sketchy at night.

Twice my house was broken into with my giant direwolf downstairs & both times my dog barked & scared off the intruders.   
Instead of going to attack them, he was just saying ""Look at me"" then prancing towards him like a bubbly giant puppy hoping for head scratches.

People would cross the street to not have to walk near him, and he would bark trying to say ""Hey, I'm friendly please pat me on the head"" but everyone was scared of the love bug. Now I have a Shiba Inu & she's more of a guard dog than my Husky ever was.Seems as if he's trying to look at his own tongue and has gone cross-eyed. Like you do if you try to look at your own nose.The baddies are being lulled into a false sense of security, if they dare to hop the gate, evil pooch is hiding ready to pounce.:pThat's no ordinary dog.

I bet the photographer got a ton of points from Professor Oak for that pic.My mom is obsessed with this animal. It's her profile picture on every social media platform. She makes me call her Pika sometimes and calls me Pika as well. It's confusing.

Edit: [yup](http://i.imgur.com/Hqi7vcb.jpg)I just read about this thing. It's more endangered than the panda. The Chinese call it a Magic Rabbit.>Native to the Xinjiang region of China, there are only 1,000 of these tiny, cute creatures, known as the Ili pika, left.

>Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat further up the mountain peaks.The name of it comes from the name of area where it's found, Ili Prefecture (which is actually a shortened version). 

There's so little information because of how elusive it is so we can't currently determine causes of its endangerment. The area is somewhat mountainous as you can see in the picture, perhaps they just fall off and die or some shit.Pika Pika.Imagine how lucky one of those feet would be...

* front door relocated.

[removed]Your house grew a new wing!Coming from a house built by my father, after 15 years of living here, we finally got the last room of the house finished a few weeks ago.... Kinda...
Anyway, your dad did a great job on your house, looks great!That looks extremely norwegian. Great on him for fixing up the house .At first I was like, *why didn't you take this from the same angle*, but then I realized the entire part on the right is essentially new. That's some serious renovation work. Very sharp lookingI love how the additions actually fit the architectural style of the house. So many shitty additions look like shitty additions.My uncle was only a carpenter as a hobby but his and my aunt's house is the same way.  It started out as a 1 bedroom house about as big a as a double wide trailer.  They've added 2 bedrooms, a den with a second story master bedroom above it, and a 2 car garage.  He's probably tripled the square footage.  Not to mention the couple of big storage sheds and deck he's also built in the back yard.That's a great looking house.I honestly really like the second window he added on the face of the house facing the camera You've got to be more than a carpenter to pull that off! Did he hire expertise for concrete, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or anything?In all seriousness it would be amazing to have those kind of skills. I'm in the process of having a home built by a builder and constantly think man it must be amazing to be able to build your own home or do your own major repairs because you already have all of the tools and the skills to do it. Plus he probably know all kinds of people in the trade that can take care of other trades like electrical or plumbing.Wow. Jeg så deg poste dette på Face. Interessant.Sons of construction workers can relate.

My dad extended the house by one room, and the top of that room became the balcony for the 2nd floor. Built 3 toolsheds that outlasted him.

Cal. Dept. of Water Resources is letting out so much water from the lake in order to keep salinity levels of the delta in check. When they dropped the flow down too far, salt water from the San Francisco Bay started to creep in. There are multiple reasons for this, one being environmental (the Delta Smelt...) and irrigation purposes. Although it's part of it, California, or rather, Folsom and Sacramento, are NOT drinking this lake dry.

EDIT: Image [Source](http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/multimedia/california-drought-20140225/) thx /u/HeadAs a Sacramentonian, we joke that it's Folsom pond instead of Folsom lake.

Except now there's not even water to joke about.

Edit: Good-bye inbox; thank you all fellow SACRAMENTONIANS (I will call us what I darn-tootin' well please). This was fun. Time to go wallow in the American creek. Conserve water, drink beer.I thought kids floated?Never thought I would see Folsom, CA on the front page. /r/californiaswaterMeanwhile in south Florida, there hasn't been a single day in months where we haven't had at least six inches of rain. It's been torrential the world is ending rain every single day since at least April. As someone who grew up on Folsom lake this is a horrifying shot.. I used to go here as a kid and always saw the water go down but this is terrifying. Guess I won't be going back to Sacramento anytime soonThe kids can still play on the beach, just without the splashing around in water part...Looks like New VegasI'd be metal detecting the hell out of that place""No lifeguard on duty...*forever*""It's worth pointing out that people only used to swim there because some people dug a reservoir and dammed a river. It's not a natural lake. California has been living on borrowed water for a long time. No one should be surprised when the bill comes due.Drought is part of the natural water cycle in California. Yes, people expanded to where they shouldn't have, without better backup systems in place. Yes, we are have a particularly bad drought right now.

I don't exactly know how this cultural attitude changed, but people scoff at big projects these days. Covering the CA aquaduct with solar panels, for instance. Or William Shatner's proposed super-long pipeline. Folks should also look up NAWAPA, a plan in the 50's to do man-made water distribution throughout the western US. Hell, even William Shatner proposed a super-long pipeline of a similar nature.

Astonishingly, the notion of long pipelines immediately invokes visions of science fiction in people's minds. Then when you point out that the petrochem industry makes *colossal* pipelines all the time, that is somehow considered irrelevant.

I will immediately betray what I said above, though: this isn't a usual cycle, and we are seeing something change. The Salton Sea was left to die, and it is have a ripple effect in the ecosystem all along the coast. The desertification of the LA region was essentially halted with the creation of the Salton Sea 100 years ago. The existence of the sea sustained weather systems that made the LA region much more livable. Now that the sea is essentially gone, the greater LA area is undergoing a drastic desertification, with soaring temperatures and exposure.

The sea could be saved, too, but again, people scoff at it. A 90 mile seawater pipeline could be built from the Gulf of California to refill the Salton Sea. Cost estimates are somewhere in the $500m-1b range. Scoffing ensues, but you can look at school districts that issues bonds in the hundreds-of-millions range that are just absorbed into people's pockets. If you listen to Eisenhower and compare to military spending, $1b is a small investment compare to military build-up.

... and seawater is actually less salty than the Sea is now! The Sea is 200 feet below sea level, and the pipeline could be passive, if designed correctly. There is a huge dry lake bed in Mexico that could be refilled to an artificial sea, too, if the pipeline was properly built. A little tricky, since it is 80 feet above seal level, but by coupling it to to the -200ft Salton Sea siphon could also make this a passive benefit.

Even if pumping was added, solar or thermal collectors could be added along the length of the pipe, thus making it zero net energy. The economic benefit alone to both countries would likely offset the cost within a decade. The biggest problem would be dealing with Mexico, now that they are a essentially a failed nation.Kids these days have no imagination.

We both spent a summer trapping these bears together, check us out at @grizkid and @jefe_larson on Instagram 

Side note, the drugged bear walked all of the way out of the den and we had to physically stop it until it fell asleep so that it would get hurt or lost while on the drug""Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour, Ursa Major?""That poor bear is scared as hell.  It can't run away and is backed up into the far end of the den.  It has to be the equivalent of an alien abduction for the thing. 

There I was asleep in my bed, when suddenly there was a bright light on my bedroom, and this little pink creature stabbed me with this weird claw on a stick.  I tried to run away but he had me cornered. As he closed the distance between us I tried to fight him off, but I must have blacked out afterwards, and then I woke up with another device implanted in my neck. I went to the bear doctor to have the last one removed, but they were only able to partially remove it. I'm really scared, and I don't feel like I'm in control of my life. 

Edit: typos. Well, at least that guys gonna go on to win an oscarITT: only jokes.

It was basically an arctic rainforest because everything was so wet and overgrown with vegetation. There was fresh water everywhere, I did not have to worry about my water supply. Camped in a random clearing. Probably the best day of my life.

2nd best day would be the 8 hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo. Every minute of that 8 hour train ride has an /r/earthporn front page worthy view, for real. Listened to some Sigur Ros and it was just perfect.

After a bit of sleuth work I've found the load charts for the crane in the accident. From the information I've found the crane is a Leibherr LR1300 with 555' of boom. 
https://www.coastcrane.com/docs/default-source/lr1300/lr1300---2316-luffing-jib-capacity-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=2
Looking over the manual, with the configuration this crane was running, it was a limit of 15 mph winds. Reports are there were easily 30mph gusts(probably more between this buildings). 
This is all based on speculation and none of it is a fact, just felt like looking into it. Glad it wasn't worse than what it was!

I lived in NYC for a long time, and this is one of those things that I just never think about.  So many buildings are always under construction, and so many cranes are just sitting above you.

[His Interview with Dan Perez - Vimeo - 5 Minutes](https://vimeo.com/76218172)I am in front of a computer screen.Took me a second to realize there is in fact a bridge above their heads. You are under a bridge.

\>Look

Somebody has painted an abstract mural on it. Two trolls are minding their own business at the north end.

\>Go north. 

The trolls have taken notice of you and draw their weapons. It took me a while to focus my eyes and see the bridge.No Man's BridgeReal Life Monument Valley.I don't ever wanna feel *~~how~~ like* I did that day.

Edit: Derp[@!#?@!](http://i.imgur.com/73mXay6.jpgpLX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/18ez5cvyy88w9jpg.jpg)This image takes me back to the first time I did acid. I was in high school, and the rest of my family was away at some farming convention for the weekend. I was out on the back porch and placed a tab under my tongue. Based on everything I had read and heard, I had done some meditation and relaxation exercises to try and reach as calm and steady a state as possible. I kind of wanted a spiritual sort of experience.

About 45 minutes after I took it, I really started to focus on my breathing. I could feel my skin merging with the air, and everything felt very solid, and whole. Until, that is, I opened my eyes. At that point, the clouds seemed to part, and the sky split open. The sun became a giant pixelated Mario head, and tried to eat me. I ran back inside, but was lucid enough to realize I wasn't okay. I didn't want to risk making a mess of my parents house, so I went back outside and ran straight for the neighbor's house.

They were growing a bunch of egg plants out back. For some reason, I thought the egg plants looked kind of like old-timey bombs, and I felt like I had to disarm them. Of course, this meant picking them all. Their fuses were still burning though, so I did the only thing I could think of: I pissed all over them. It put out the fuses, but the neighbor's wife came running out and beat the shit out of me with a dirty pair of trousers.So, I actually *was* under this bridge a while ago, and for people wondering, it still looks fantastic. People have respected the murals around the city that this artist has done and it really brightens up my day whenever I see one. Compare to Escher: [1](http://www.sciencedump.com/sites/default/files/field/gallery/escher-metamorphose_0.png), [2](http://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/m-c-escher/liberation.jpg)*Looks at photo in awe.* *""Under the Bridge"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers plays in head*If Qbert had been designed by a surrealist painter.

Airlines and the military have strict policies regarding weather conditions at takeoff and arrival, and weather enroute. Flying through thunderstorms deliberately is a pretty big no no in most cases, and when squall lines can be hundreds of miles long, it can cause a lot of problems.

Remember that the next time someone complains about weather delays or cancellations.. ask if they actually want to fly in weather the pilots don't even want to.am i the only one who for a second thought this would be a Delta flight pic from 1889Hi All. I was on this flight. I assure you, it was not a fun ride.

What am I doing wrongHail can actually be encountered flying between 2 storms.  As it is can be violently thrown out of the clouds.  Now, couple that with the aircraft flying at say 400 knots and you can see the reason how and why this fucked up the plane so bad.  It's also highly advised to keep a safe distance between storm so this doesn't happen.

Then I'd write another letter to Delta, thanking them for hiring the calibre of pilots that will land a plane in this condition and get me down on the ground in one piece.

I never knew the lizard people were around in ancient Egypt already.AZIZ LIGHT!Too bad ISIS is going to blow it up.Until ISIS gets hold of it.

Tack för bilden. Hi OP, what kind of camera did you use?

Also, awesome picture!-24C is known as Spring here in Northern Canada. Perfect time to break out the shorts!You should be forging steel under the moonlight!I am convinced Sweden is one of the most beautiful places in the world, filled to the brim with beautiful people. All the Swedish ladies I've met so far have been absolute stunners. I love the accent too. Frequently I've considered moving to Sweden from America and while I think I could learn the language without too much difficulty, the challenge of finding a job that pays high enough to maintain the comfortable lifestyle I currently have seems daunting. Then there's all the craziness going on with the refugees. Someday though, someday. Well, this exploded. I have lost control over the comments.

Thank for all your kind words! 

As for camera, i use a Canon EOS 1200D, and on this picture i used an EFS 10-18 lens. 15s shutter F4,5 iso 400. I'm so fucking jealous.

I used to work at a coal fired power plant. The plant had tall stacks that peregrines would nest at every year, which was cool because they were endangered at the time. One day, I'm working on the roof on an AC unit and my coworker and I spot 2 peregrines flying past us. We stop and watch them for a second and we notice that 1 of them has something in his talons (a mouse or something we assumed). Then out of nowhere, right in front of us, the one with the mouse flies upside down, the other one grabs the mouse out of his talons, and then he flips back and they continue on into the distance. Makes me wonder how many people have ever seen something like that.

EDIT: Cool I didn't expect to get so much visibility on this!
Bonus Story: I took a break on the 10th floor and the falcons were nesting above where I was standing. They started gawking and divebombing at me because I guess their nest was nearby.Write a book about it called My Side of the SkyscraperFalcony?Humans can barely afford a walk-up with a shared bathroom in Chicago. How the Hell does a single income falcon afford a one bedroom with a nursery and a view?I like the how Hawks faces is like

""Please don't kick us out sir, the weather is unforgiving""Being able to use skyscrapers as nesting areas is what helped bring back the Peregrine Falcon back from near-extinction.""I made these.""This was the second attempt by the Falcon pair too. They lost all their clutches of eggs two summers ago :(

The apt owner is a cool guy on top of having bad-ass falcons on his porch too. Does a lot of sketch shows and has hosted a few trivia nights at a nearby bar.

Hopefully they'll be back next year"" sooo, is this going to be an issue or something?"" ""excuse me sir these are my fluffs and I'm going to have to ask you to take a few steps back""We have a peregrine falcon family that lives right above us in an apartment in Brooklyn. What I've learned over the past few years:

* The male (I assume) is as bad as a rooster in the mornings and will not shut up.
* They shit constantly. There are times in the summer when we pray for a good rain to clean off our terrace and there are often lovely white streaks down the sides of our windows.
* They are merciless murderers of pigeons.
* They do not like to eat the heads of pigeons. They are happy leaving those as little presents for us to try and keep our dog from eating.
* They will chirp kind of cutely outside a window from time to time.
* People like hearing about the falcon family that lives above you right up until they see a decapitated pigeon right in front of them that we hadn't noticed and cleaned up.
It's not the photographer's balcony, btw. The guy living there let the photographer and the photographer's girlfriend stay with him for a little bit to get the photos though.That is the fastest bird................... in the world.*LET'S GO HAWKS!*>The account caught the eye of Luke Massey as he lounged one night in his camper van near Venray, the Netherlands, scrolling through Instagram after a full day filming beavers.

>""I feel that I should mention that this is not a normal living area. These houses are called ""Kolonihavehuse"". They are small houses, about 30-40 m^2, with a garden. People who live in the city sometimes have these to have a little undisturbed garden somewhere. The houses usually have a living room, bathroom and a small kitchen. People do not actually live there, and people rarely sleep there.""No, it's not.

The effect is caused by diffraction across each individual leaf. According to this picture, the lens used to take this photo had an aperture diaphragm comprised of 14 leaves.

And an interesting bit form an interview he gave in December:

> ""You know what? I used to say, every day, 'I am so sick and tired of shaving.' I had to shave every day, every day, for 33 years,"" he explained. ""And even before that when I was working on local TV. And I just thought, the first thing I will do when I am not on TV is stop shaving. And everybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it,"" he explains. ""But it's interesting. I've kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I'm sort of enjoying. I can tell that people are off-put by it. And the more people implore me to shave, the stronger my resolve is to not shave.""

Source: http://www.eonline.com/news/750958/david-letterman-is-balding-bearded-and-looking-as-happy-as-ever-in-st-bartsCompletely unrecognizable is exactly the look I'd go for if I were him.He probably walks around wherever he wants, and people leave him alone. He's exercising, he doesn't have to shave, he's gone back to college and joined the girls' volleyball team...  

I see nothing wrong here.It's like someone took the Ring from him and now his body is catching up to his age. You know, like Blibo.Er, you got any gum?if he put his glasses on it would be totally obvious...grand maester pycelle?When you get home from work after 35 years and can be yourself againWait....this is total BS....Right? Letterman had hair?!Still reppin' Ball State, the only thing keeping Muncie, IN alive. 

Edit: Holy turds, I've got some reading to do. Figured a comment about Muncie on reddit would get buried af. Even though I haven't lived there since 1982, Muncie still holds a special place in my heart. I spent summers with my grandparents there growing up. Now I have to get nostalgic for a minute. Lots of fond memories of Pizza King (I'd kill for a Royal Feast right now), the Baskin Robbins and the movie theater it was attached to, cinnamon raisins biscuits from Hardee's, swimming and learning to play golf at the Delaware, trips to Upland to go to Ivanhoe's, Aladdin's Castle at the mall and beef manhattan's from the MCL, the urine stenched slide at Mitchell elementary, watching the cooks make the pizza at Noble Roman's, the children's museum, I'll^just^stahp^here^onions.

Edit #2: Just thought of a story about the first and last time my sister got to see the house my mom grew up in. My parents moved the family to Texas before my sister was born. My mother grew up poor and things were tough for her as a child. Growing up, she wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Muncie and leave it in her past forever. My mother, sister and I had to go back to Muncie for a funeral several years ago. While there, my sister wanted to see where my mom was raised and asked me to drive by, though my mother wanted no part of it. Let's just say the house was east of Broadway and south of McGalliard. I warned her that this would probably only happen once, if it was even still standing. I pulled up and parked out in the street, but told my sister we would not be getting out of the car. We sat for all of two minutes before I sped off, my mom in tears and my sister terrified. ""Neighbors"" started coming out of their homes to case us, yell at us and were rapidly approaching the car to do who knows what. It wasn't a fun trip.Since for some reason no one thought to post a picture of what he used to look like, apparantly assuming everyone in the world has seen his show, I give you this image.

[According to ABC, this picture was taken on his show May 4th, 2015](http://i.imgur.com/znBHbdj.jpg)

He has looked a certain way for decades (shaven, hair in a certain way, suit) so of course he would want to switch it up now that he has the opportunity. Also he might want some privacy now that he is retired. He was awesome the last few months on air. There were no fucks given!He used to jog around my high school's track in Connecticut. Used to see him all the time. I'd never have guessed that was him.TIL in retirement one ages similar to that of a fruit fly. Santa??Even though you told me that's David Letterman, I'm having a hard time imagining that person as being David Letterman.The Ball State shirt gives it away. That's the first time I've seen him look happy in like 23 yearsJust last night I was watching some old clips of Dave on Youtube.  He was discussing with Jon Stewart how he dislikes shaving.  His excuse was something like, ""I don't like looking at my own face every morning"", and not shaving allowed him to avoid that.

It appears closer in the photograph than it does in streetview due to the perspective distortion of the telephoto lens used by the original photographer. However, if you look very closely, you can see many of the same landmarks. You can also see the changes/construction made between 2006 (when this photo was uploaded to [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phuentsholing_Bhutan_Indien.jpg)) and 2013. Keep in mind this is an extremely humid climate.

This photograph just happens to be taken under the face of some construction that caused debris to fall into the as-yet-uncovered sewer. The sewer is now covered with concrete slabs, which now serves as a walkway with fencing and doesn't look that bad.

A further exercise would be to examine the nearby streetview on either side of the border. Then you'll see there is not such a disparity as is attempted to be portrayed whenever this photo is posted.They need to do the needful on the India side there. Couple things I noticed, learned, and saw when in India for business. I was in a city, so I can't speak for the rest of the country nor can I speak about rural areas. I did not live there, I only did work and left. And before anybody thinks I'm disrespecting India, I loved my trip and I'd go back.

1) Trash was thrown on street sides. Often people gathered it up and tossed it in large piles in more centralized areas. People rummage through the trash looking for food. Then animals do the same. Whatever is left either stays there or is taken by the poorest of the poor. During the rainy season, this trash often ends up in drainage systems which end up clogged so the streets flood. Then someone is sent in to clean the drains and that person often removes lots of trash and puts it back into the large pile. The cycle continues. While I was there for just under two weeks, three people died cleaning drains.

2) The most wealthy parts of the city look like most ""first world"" cities. They have very new high rise buildings which are well maintained, cleaned, and they employ lots of people doing lots of small jobs. When you have so many people to employ, things that are taken for granted in other places become a job for someone.

3) Everybody knows someone that can be paid to get something done. Here in the US you need licensed contractors to build buildings and you need licensed electricians and plumbers. You need to have a contractor or your utility company come hook up power, phone, sewer, etc. I experienced more pay-offs in my short time in India than I can even believe. Right down to my driver paying off the guards at my hotel to just let us through instead of stopping us every day for bomb checks. While this social system employs lots of people that take a small cut at every level, it's obviously rife with abuse.

4) The resources required to run a single unified nation with over a billion people in it is unfathomable. And since India is what many would consider a developing country, those resources are scarce and badly needed. Imagine trying to provide medical care for a BILLION people, many of whom make the equivalent of a few US dollars a year. Imagine the public works project that would be required to collect, sort, recycle, and properly dispose of trash for a city that has 20-20k people per square kilometer! Just the amount of trash produced is staggering and now you have to pay people to collect it and properly handle it?!


Again, I loved my trip to India and I'd go again in an instant. It really taught me a lot about the world and how I looked at it through the lens of my own daily experience. I saw human beings eating plastic bags for food. I also saw the Taj hotel. I saw things that made me uncomfortable like the tourist traps set up around the Mumbai terror attacks, and I saw beautiful city streets with big box stores and the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen. I think that extreme contrast changed me a bit for the better, but I can say that not every part of India looks like this, but I suspect a lot of the areas not chock full of rich people do.[deleted][California | Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Border_Mexico_USA.jpg)I wish we can see more left side tho but thats quite disturbingLooks like my gfs side of the bed vs mine. Seriously, Bhutan is the shit.

They have a law that says 60 percent of their country must remain forest.

The king is called the Dragon King. 

They are a country with less than a million people that sits on the border between China and India, and they have never been invaded by either one.

[deleted]Late to this and is probably going to be buried, but I have lived in Bhutan for approximately 3 years (2002, 2003, various summers) because my father was posted there (Indian Army has many projects in Bhutan). The Bhutanese are very clean, neat and organized people. They are warm and welcoming, but this is the border with West Bengal (Which is a shitty Indian state that other Indians hate too). While a lot of India is dirty, this specific state is known to be the absolute fucking worst. Also what you're looking at is just one aspect.

a few weeks later my friend, the guy who shipped the dead armadillo, got very ill and was in the hospital for a couple weeks with some kind of stomach infection that descended further into his digestive tract. he had to have part of his intestines removed and was touch and go for a bit in the hospital.

This means the ""north"" end of Pluto is constantly rotisserieing in sunlight, and the ""south"" end away from the Sun is in constant darkness.

So think of these as the mountains lining the way into Modor, constantly in twilight.Interesting to note the lack of crater activity. what are those layers in the atmosphere, and what's causing these mountain ranges to crop up? why does pluto have mountains but, say, the moon doesn't?for scale:

http://imgur.com/20TwnclThose mountain ranges look massive Question for any science-savy person: 

What are the causes of such enormous mountains? Plate techtonics? Impacts? I would love to know how tall those mountains are.Absolutely amazing. Less money spent on war and more spent on giving NASA it's budget back.  Now we need a new edit for one of my favorite wallpapers https://i.imgur.com/p5fLTnB.jpgMeh.  You should see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion.  Now that's something.The title of this picture in /r/space is simply “Close-up of sunset on Pluto”.

It really shows how sensationalist /r/pics has become.If that doesn't convince the Flat-Plutoists nothing will.Do we have any idea how tall those mountains are? How do they take such wonderful pictures with so little light? How big are these mountains? Ballpark it or something i just need an answer.Earth is prettier...I officially call Dibs on Pluto. Sorry everyone, I'm pretty sure I'm first to call dibs....soo...Why does it appear to have atmosphere?It is amazing,

Not that I don't agree with the sentiment expressed here, but it is true that the petrochemical industry is one of the largest sectors of our (Louisiana's) economy, so any big museum, park, etc. will usually have large donations from those companies.That's some slick marketing skills. The Whitest Kids U' Know said it best:

United Petroleum Rep: ""You know they say that Oil and water don't mix""

United Petroleum Scientist: ""But dammit if we're not trying""

Reminds me of the [insectarium](http://imgur.com/5NqIXkg) at the St. Louis Zoo.[Google's street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.9507235,-90.0632551,3a,37.5y,87.62h,71.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swAEkZd2KUbI-LF6AgfavxA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)By far my favorite moment from visiting the New Orleans aquarium was pranking a little kid.

There was a concave viewing window in the big tank, but head on, you could tell.  There was a little girl sitting head-on but a bit far away.  It seemed she didn't notice that she could poke her head into the concavity to look around.

I went up to the window and said, ""Hey, watch this,"" and placed my hand, mime-style, on where she seemed to think the glass was.  And then *pushed.*

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""  And she ran off.

I later saw her frantically pointing at me to who I assumed was her mom as I was leaving.I love how that whole take is supposed to show how those oil rigs provide a great undersea ecosystem.  Fish love Big Oil!They gave us the aquarium so that we dont have to worry about the real ocean anymore. It's also of note that the tank's design and layout are intended to simulate the bottom of an oil rig, so their sponsorship (while certainly eyebrow-raising) DOES sort of make sense.

As a New Orleanian, I know they have the money. I don't like it, but I know it. And I'd rather the kids see it, while the adults roll their eyes at the irony.I thought the same thing when I went there for the first time. 

I always imagined that one day they would put on a kids presentation, showing that there is no way that oil can harm sea life, because water and oil separates. There for, the fist are fine. Or some other BS like that. I was working offshore on a Shell platform when they accidentally pumped 80bbls of Biocide into the Gulf.... ""Oops! My bad...."" 
Reported? = Nope""We're sorry...""The lone survivors.Look at all the fish we kill!they spelled ""destroyed"" wrong I fucking HATED this when I went to NOLA Aquarium.  The entire exhibit is about how the oil rigs provide substrate for coral to grow and create habitat for fish and other marine life.  Yeah I get it that there are fish near oil rigs but not a fucking WORD about the oil spill or cleanup or anything.  Twisted.""Nature - sponsored by corporations"" [deleted]Y'all laugh, but after the oil spill we had a big problem with people marking the BP sign. People would use anything red to cross out that sign: crayons, pencils, markers, sharpies, and most commonly lipstick. After it was all said and done and everything cooled down, AAOA had to buy a new sign. Someone usually stayed by the sign on busier days.

The whole Gulf of Mexico exhibit is geared towards promoting oil companies because to some extent, they actually do help. The right side of the exhibit shows a barren seabed. A few scattered rocks provide minimal cover for small fish, so normally you only see medium to large fish and sharks. On the left side, there's a quarter scale model of an oil rig, which provides hiding spaces for smaller fish which in turn attract even more medium and larger fish. In recent years, reef balls and pipes have been added to show other ways of promoting smaller fish to move in.

Oil rigs, when properly maintained, benefit everyone with perks that are not just about oil. Although making sure you don't spill tons upon tons of oil into the ocean really helps.

Edit: Look, I'm stating this as what they teach their volunteers and how it's presented. This is what they taught me for the years and thousands upon thousands of hours that I worked there and this is the image that AAOA wants to present to the public.

And if you think for one second that I feel that the Horizon disaster was an afterthought, then you have another thing coming. I watched those struggling pelicans with the same sense of hopelessness as I did upon ""the grand pre-open tour"" after Katrina when we basically had nothing alive save for a few animals who could breath air and a couple very stubborn fish. Having gone through nearly a complete aquarium's worth of animals in 2005, if you were there working and if your house had been damaged, you had to develop a very dry sense of humor.

Edit edit: OK, I get it. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was very bad. Y'all act like this didn't effect me, my family, my friends, my workplace, or anything. Please, stop PM'ing me nasty things. Y'all are worse than the lady who thought that penguins were fish and that I couldn't be possibly be right in saying that they were bird and followed me around the rest of the afternoon trying to have a debate to defend her penguin-fish platform.Reminds me of the song Big Yellow Taxi:

*They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum*

*And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them*

*No, no, no*

*Don't it always seem to go*

*That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone*

*They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot*
And that, is, irony!If only we could fit the entire gulf in a tank, just think about all the extra oil we could drill out there in the new desert.Remember when it was sponsored by itself and doing just fine?","{'Sadness': 0.050395, 'Anger': 0.938904, 'Analytical': 0.049, 'Emotional_Range': 0.818, 'Tentative': 0.69, 'Joy': 0.053192, 'Disgust': 0.182546, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.089, 'Fear': 0.315218, 'Openness': 0.265, 'Extraversion': 0.613, 'Agreeableness': 0.595}"

Really fucking weird movie. Lonely dude pays random actors to pretend to be his family for his birthday. I recommend a watch, if you're fluent in Spanish.Hardly a new idea. Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did something similar on his famous painting 'Las Meninas', in the 17th Century.

The painting depicts the Royal Spanish infanta Margarita Teresa with her maids and other aids, taken from the point of view of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana who are at the same time posing for a portrait that Velázquez himself is depicted painting (left side).

The only clue we have about who is Velázquez painting in this scene is a mirror hanging at the back of the room, where the reflection of the king and queen can be seen.

This is in Milan, Italy 
  
> Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a pair of residential towers in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy, between Via Gaetano de Castillia and Via Federico Confalonieri near Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station. They have a height of 110 metres (360 ft) and 76 metres (249 ft) and will host more than 900 trees (approximately 550 and 350 trees in the first and second towers respectively) on 8,900 square metres (96,000 sq ft) of terraces. Within the complex is also an 11-story office building; its facade does not host plants.

> The towers were designed by Boeri Studio (Stefano Boeri,Gianandrea Barreca and Giovanni La Varra). It also involved input from horticulturalists and botanists.Any civil engineers here have some insight to how this works in the long term?

As far as I know, roots don't give a fuck about concrete and will just grow straight through it. I'm assuming they do something to prevent this, maybe metal instead etc. That's gotta be a bitch to maintain honestly. hanging gardens have been built in a far away land! Dude, vertical forest.

I really like how unique the vertical view is in terms of re-framing our relationship to trees.  Seeing the forest 'deconstructed' in a way, one apartment = one tree, really drives home how connected we really are, when cities tend to obscure this aspect by removing trees, turning that relationship from direct to abstract by completely separating the cityspace from the naturespace.

Who wants a tutorial?

Edit: I'll make a tutorial tomorrow, sorry but it's not a straight forward filter like you're hoping (I was too!). Some people have asked if you just fold the image, that's certainly possible but as you've all seen it creates major artefacts, due to the warping. It's a great place to start though as it helps to establish what you should be aiming for. Those of you familiar with Photoshop this technique is essentially a matte painting especially with more complicated images. 

Basically you don't bend the image, you duplicate, rotate as necessary and then mask the connecting line with any techniques you can. Such as using the clone tool or selecting objects and spreading them across the connecting line to conceal the stitch. Oceans and beaches work well because our eyes are expecting to see repeated patterns which can hide the appearance of repeated sections. 

I'm pretty sure you chaps who are familiar with photoshop will get the idea. I think it does look better than the original because of that slant on the left. And the contrast between the land and the sea makes it even better. Amazing job! This one looks better! Good job!I thought this image looked familiar. I've used it before in my work

One thing to note about this photographer is that he actually dressed up to go to the wedding.

Having been to quite a few weddings now, a shocking amount of photographers turn up dressed like it's a hacky sack tournament on the college lawn. Dear all men (and/or women): take everything out of your suit pockets before the photo session. I am sorry I am not staring at you, I am taking your picture.My best friend is a wedding photographer/videographer, and it's honestly amazing the more I watch how much angles, lens, filter can change a shot. My sisters wedding was outdoors, and it happened to be overcast when it was supposed to be sunny and an unprecedented rain actually moved in later in the evening (damn TX weather), but you couldn't even tell in any of the shots. He made sure all pictures were taken from angles where the little bit of sun was in the background, made amazing use of the natural lighting, and always panned the video to pick up the most natural light etc. It looked so good and made my sister so happy. That guy has a great eye for photography. He's going places!For a split second I thought he was dead and I thought of Rick and Morty :(

https://www.flickr.com/photos/caseyrbrown[deleted][deleted]^^^^Some ^^^^assembly ^^^^requiredHave to wonder if there is a bunch of these sitting in the corner of some Army base warehouse because of long forgotten clerical error. I had a teacher back in high school who was in the Vietnam war.  His job was to blow up bridges so the VC couldn't follow them or use the bridges to resupply.   Well, this meant he pretty much spent most of his time hanging around ""bases"" which were no more than commandeered villages.  One day, he takes bricks that were just sitting around and made a gigantic barbecue pit.  A villager had given him a pig for some reason or another, so he decided to throw a gigantic party for everyone stationed in that village, as well as any villagers that wanted to come.  Not surprisingly, he got into huge trouble, and was removed from the village and stationed in the worst, most degrading job there was.  They made him guard a junk yard in the middle of the jungle.  It was mostly jeeps exactly like this one.

Well, as you can see from the picture, these Jeeps mostly just bolt together. So 12 hours a day with nothing to do, his boredom got the best of him, so he started bolting these pieces together from various junked Jeeps to see if he could make a functioning Jeep.   He said he got about 90% there. The only thing he couldn't do with the parts he had was functioning brakes.  So he did the best he could, he bolted a gigantic pole to the side of the jeep that he could shove into the tire and pull as hard as he could to slow the jeep down.

He ended up driving the jeep around that little area for his remaining time in Vietnam, sometimes even driving around officers and other dignitaries, no one even questioned whether he was supposed to have a Jeep or why he had to use a gigantic pole to stop.The ultimate example of ""its worth more in the box"". http://imgur.com/a/5ZgEX

Army vet here, I was stationed in South Korea back in the early 80's. I worked at the base HQ but was all enlisted were required to pull motor pool duty one week a month. I reported ""as ordered"" to the Motor pool non-com and was assigned the duty of tearing down and repacking two Korean War era jeeps. They looked very much like the picture. They crates had a jeep size fold-out cloth with actual sized spots for each individual parts with pictographs of where to find the part on a jeep and how to remove them. The entire process could be done without reading any words. It took me ten days to complete the job. It was a most satisfying task.
Fragiiiillllle.Does it include an allen wrench or what?Are these the ""jeep kits"" that where offered for sale for $450.00 in the back of old magazines? First thing I thought ""Some assembly required"" I kinda wish that I could get a modern car shipped to me like this.  It would be fun to have to put it together before you use it.  Like the adult version of Legos!

**Edit:** I completely forgot about kit cars!  So I guess this still is a thing.They did this with larger vehicles too, I have a M35A2 and they were designed to ship in crates as well.  The tops disassemble with simple tools, windshield folds town and the highest point on the vehicle is the top of the steering wheel.I believe they were a lot more effective after they replaced the square wooden wheels with round rubber onesJ.ust

Finally something I feel qualified to talk about...

These are, indeed, German turrets, called pillboxes, that were designed to overlook the small town of Saint Malo and defend it against a joint American/British attacks.

Now, if you don't know anything about St Malo, here is a picture to set the mood:

https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&rais=1&oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.letriskel.co.uk%2Fimages%2Frsz_st_malo_june_09_052.jpg&sp=d4f6453f5ef9ca2a9434f0309d0103d2

Now, St Malo is an old medieval city, surrounded by enormous walls. The Germans built a fortress in St Malo proper, along with a series of bunkers in a small hill overlooking the city, the only visible part of which are these gun turrets.

They also built another series of bunkers and AA guns on an island (called Cezembre), which is about 25 minutes away from St Malo, effectively turning the city and its bay into one enormous fortress.

In 1944, shortly after the Normandy Landing, the Allies were faced with a difficult task: either ignore St Malo and risk that the German fortress would attack their rear lines (as it is fairly close to Normandy) or try take the city and suffer heavy losses.

The solution taken was dramatic: the American and the British air forces fire-bombed the city and the Cezembre island for several days, essentially destroying pretty much every building within the city walls, and turning the island bunkers into a pile of rubble. I have seen old German AA guns on that island, and they were warped from the heat.

The final operation saw British ships shelling the German gun turrets from the sea. Pretty much each turret is pockmarket with these shells, and you can actually put your fist in some of these all the way inside the turret itself. The poor bastards inside did not stand a chance.

American ground troops then swept in and the Germans surrendered pretty much without a fight. My family is from there and my father and grand-father used to tell me stories about this battle.

You can look up Saint Malo on Wikipedia, and there are also tons of other sites that talk about the place, which is very beautiful and interesting. The real shame is that the original German bunkers are now closed.

EDIT: well, my first real comment on Reddit, and I got Gold! Thanks!!That particular gun emplacement overlooks the harbour entrance at St-MaloCrazy and saddening to look at that, and think ""Wow, look at those holes! That must have been intense!""

But then to realise I'm 30yrs old, and in all probability it was guys a full decade younger than me sitting in there utterly terrified wanting to go home.

That line between ""well that is certainly interesting"" and ""jesus fuck, this actually happened..."" is a complicated one.Bullet holes make it look like a slightly melted chocolate.Good grief what kind of gun made the holes?

Cause im thinking of this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtopxCjs518

Obviously its not the same quality steel but still.Is that a shell you can see stuck in one of the holes? About a third of the way from the top towards the left side.I went to Normandy 2 years ago while in France for work and two things really struck me:

One, you'd have to be insane to storm that beach. It's wide and deep and it was easy to see the massive advantage the gunners had over the invaders. I knew this based on everything that I have read or seen, but nothing prepares you for seeing it in real life.

Two, while you could still see and even walk into the pill boxes and other fortification that the Germans built, they were starting to be overcome by nature. That was amazing to me. In 50 years those scars will be gone.

Edit: wordsKV-5 radioman's turret IRL.Sorry, you didn't roll high enough.  That's only a glancing hit, you don't get to roll on the penetration table[Shell still stuck.](http://i.imgur.com/SSMEIsY.jpg)Can you imagine being inside that thing during some of those hits?

But then again Im super high The reason the lake is clear is because of zebra mussels and other invasive species filtering the water. Its devastating to the eco-system, killing birds and fish. Its cool to see the shipwrecks but its extremely bad for the great lakes.

Unfortunately, it's 40 degrees and the water is still around 35-38 so there's no swimming.Ok, I don't want to alarm anyone but I'm pretty sure that is the Millenium Falcon.What's the current environmental condition of Lake Michigan like?How rude!

They let you mail a postcard for free. I mailed one to myself because it was the only address I knew. Mine read:

Hey. I'm drunk in Boston!

Don't forget to pay student loans next Monday.

Then I'd forget about it.  By the time I receive it in the mail, its always a fun little surprise.I feel like this and the starbucks bears are viral ads.Holy crap, I used to sort those postcards. 

I temp'd at the Boston Beer Company's headquarters in Southie when I lived there for a few years, and this would have been in October of 2014. As the front receptionist, it was my job to sort through those postcards that came from the brewery and make sure nothing vulgar got through. Probably so that the many, many fantastical drawings of penises didn't wind up on places like Reddit and get associated with Sam Adams brand... 

I used to put stickers on dirty messages and still send them through because it made me laugh. Occasionally I even added a note of my own to the postcard if it was really funny. It was a really annoying part of the job because they come in huge bags, but it was also pretty fun because of hilarious messages like this one. 

You'd be surprised how much this occurs. Thanks, dad.

Please come home.

Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?I was at a party once and these two guys were just kinda doing your basic small talk. One mentions his hometown, other guy used to live in that hometown. Turns out the guy he was talking to was from the family his parents sold their old house to! They became really good friends after that too, it was one of the funnier bromances I've ever seen.The lady who grew up in the house I now own is creepily attached to it, and often emails me to subtly reprimand me for any changes I've made to the house (apparently she drives past it frequently).

She also stops by to visit at least once a year, and tried to get me to agree to swap houses with her for a weekend.

Sample text from page 1, see page 2 fire some more cool pictures:

> Jeeps were produced and packed this way for shipment to U.S. forces and countries like England and the Soviet Union who the U.S. supplied during WW II. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Richmond, CA, about 70% of production was boxed due to their close proximity to the San Francisco port.

> Boxing up a jeep was expensive and time consuming so it was only done when absolutely necessary. Jeeps that were crated were complete vehicles, not a box of parts — windshields were folded, wheels taken off and a few other things done to minimize the cubeage. Very few, if any, of these crated jeeps remained in the United States, even during the war. After more than sixty years, there are probably none left. Several organizations and dealers have had a substantial reward offer for years for anyone who can produce one and no one has claimed the money.

PartMy grandfather once bought a used amusement park ride on e-bay, and it came in a single package like this. Obviously it was much larger, delivered on a flatbed tractor trailer.

My family spent a couple weeks helping him assemble it in our corn field, but we had to stop just short of completion when it became clear that it wasn't a theme park ride, but some gigantic animatronic roadside advertisement for a Venezuelan brothel.Americans left a bunch of these behind in the Philippines after WW2 and filipinos turned it into an episode of Project Runway.Ikea supplies the military now?Fun fact: The tire tread on the jeep is designed so that it is difficult to tell which direction the vehicle was headed if you encounter a set of tracks.[75 years old this year!](http://m.imgur.com/1zXPME0?r)The orginal jeep was pretty amazing.

Ok, I got a response back from Arcaid. They told me the photo was placed with them by EWA, and gave me the name of a photographer, Friedhelm Thomas. http://www.ewastock.com/preview/83516

EDIT: 

I was able to speak with Friedhelm Thomas on the phone this morning. It was hard to communicate because of the language barrier, however I wrote them an email in English with a link to the image, asking if he took the photo and if he did, where it was taken. If they respond, I will post it here.


EDIT 2:

The photographer replied to my email, confirming that the photographer is Friedhelm Thomas and that they would respond on the weekend, when they have some help with responding to my email in English.


EDIT 3:

Friedhelm Thomas told me the photo is from 1985 and the steel and glass structure was dilapidated at that time. He does not know what happened to it since then.
The exact location of the photo was over the hotel Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo near Lake Como in northern Italy. The location of the “wintergarden” is Griante/Cadenabbia. The park belongs to Villa Maria, a variant of the world-renowned garden of Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo.

EDIT 4:

It looks like the Villa Maria has undergone a restoration since 1985.
Here is a [photo](http://www.mondolariano.it/GrianteCadenabbia/serrav.jpg) of it after
 restoration- [photo] (http://www.arteliberty.it/immaginiliberty/como/serra.jpg)

Another angle: [photo] (Here is a photo taken from abovhttp://www.alephcomo.com/Gallerie.aspx?gid=1&fid=1e:)
Here is what Google has to say about Villa Maria: ""Villa Marie is surrounded by a splendid public park, in the centre of the village. It was built between 1889 and 1892 for the will of Martin Clerc and was completed by a heir of his, called Josephine May. The project was realized by the famous architect Giacomo Mantegazza.""I'm always curious what would cause a place like this to become abandoned.

Edit: [just wow](http://imgur.com/qBLSJ5s)I lived with a roommate who had a great dog.  I loved that dog to the moon and back.  But it would bark at passers by.  It's the single only aggressive thing she ever did.  We didn't want her barking at the neighbors or their kids so we used to say ""No, dog!  No barking!""  and she'd just look at us, then keep barking.

Then one day I kind of imagined what must be going through her head...  

She's like, ""OH FUCKING SHIT! There are some assholes outside our badass good-guy-team castle! They're THREATENING our goddamn HOME fuckin' BASE!! RARARARAWR RAHRAWR!!!!""

And all she gets from us is just, ""Bad, Dog! SHHHHHHhhhhhh! No Barking!!""

Panicked, she puzzles out the problem, realizing suddenly, *Oh SHIT! That's right!  You two helpless yet lovable lumps don't have the amazing sense of smell and super-dog-hearing that I do!*  But not to worry, that's exactly her job.  Let the humans know what's going on so they can let her out the front door to start killing shit.

Dauntless, she vows not to let the interlopers get by without warning everyone in the house first. 

""I WILL FUCKING PROTECT YOUUUUUUUuuuu! RHAWRHAHRAHRAWR RAWRRAH!!""

And suddenly feel like the poor girl is just trying to keep us safe.  So after I imagined this whole scenario out I kind of decided to try changing my approach the next time.  So the following interaction went completely differently.

She started barking, and this time instead of, ""Shhh, NO!"" I was like ""Good Job, pooch! I see them too!"" And I came up and patted her on the back.  And she chilled right the hell out.  Back to her nap.

I swear this worked 100% of the time.  She even kind of just started the habit of looking at me. If I was looking back she would just let it be.

""We good? Yeah, we good.""

I miss that dog.  She's old now but still healthy. My roommate and I moved out of that place.  He's got some kids for the dog to play with so she's probably very happy.  

But I felt like the damn dog whisperer when I pulled that mind meld shit with the dog.  I bet it'll work for others too.  Seriously try it.  Let me know.

[Edited some formatting mistakes]Am I the only one who wouldn't trust random strangers with this?Of course now he will forever be pestering passers by for treats, which could potentially make some people quite nervous.Now he'll learn to bark at strangers to get a treat. Cute idea, not solid in practice. On the other hand, that could be the lesser of two weevils.ITT:  Lots of people who don't understand how dogs work.That's a great idea! But aren't you afraid that he will warm up to strangers given this habit even if it's a robber in the middle of the night?Irish Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier? What if he accidentally bites someone and they call animal control?Has nobody noticed that they spelt it thaks, not thanks?I don't agree with this approach, especially in this context. Dog will grow to expect treats from strangers. What about the one time that the stranger puts their hand out and there is no treat?  I'd prefer food refusal from strangers and to engage/train the dogs with other people around in order to desensitize them.As great as this idea may seem, it's extremely counter intuitive.
I'm certified by the APDT and focus on dog psychology and behavior, and the first and foremost important thing to remember is that dogs are not humans and their psychology is completely different. Something that works one way in the human world can have a drastic difference in the minds of dogs.

I can go on for days as of why I would not recommend the method displayed in OP's picture, but I'll try to keep it short. I once worked with a 7 year old German Shepard named Daisy. Daisy had two bad habits; she would bark at the door when someone would stand outside/attempt to enter, and she was also terrified of fireworks. As humans, when we see that someone we care about is afraid of something, we tend to nurture them and tell them that ""it's all going to be alright,"" etc. People do the exact same thing with their dogs when they seem scared or startled; they pet them and nurture them. The problem with this is the fact that what you're actually doing, despite of your good intentions, is encouraging their fear. Petting a dog is a form of encouragement and by petting them or nurturing them when their minds are in a scared state, you're actually feeding into the issue rather than helping it.

Now, back to Herbie. If Herbie has a fear of bypassers, then having them reward her state of mind is not what you'd want to do. You have to make sure (this is really important!) that you reward the right state of mind. Dogs live in the now; not yesterday or tomorrow. You have to make sure you can comprehend what state of mind your dog is in before you start rewarding them with treats. 

Those are just my two cents...Fence aggression is caused by the neglectful action of leaving dogs unattended outside in a yard. 

The dog sees a passerby and begins barking. 

The passerby has no reason to stop and engage the dog and so continues on their way. 

The dog associates the passerby leaving as their having driven them off.

This gets reinforced every time that a passerby transits the fence line.

The real solution is to actually TRAIN your dog to not ever bark at passerby by staying with them during the first TWO years of their life when outside to properly TRAIN them not to be an ANNOYING noise disturbance, NOT hand the responsibility over to strangers that don't want hear your dog BARKING at them, not to mention the neighbors, and be tasked with doing what YOU should be doing.

tl;dr It's your dog, you fucking train it.Herbie The Love DogBefore:
Bark bark bark (get away from my home!)

After:
Bark bark bark (give me treats!)From a veterinary student: Never punish a dog to treat fear. You would be pairing fear with fear which strengthens the initial fearful stimulus. Just wanted to say that first so people don't beat their dogs when they cower at fireworks. Now for the initial case, giving him treats when he barks at people he will bark more. He thinks ""whenever I bark I get treats"". So you reinforce the behavior. Unfortunately there is not a great way to treat this one if the owner isn't present because people ignoring the dog and walking by makes him think ""barking at people makes them leave"". And if this is his goal, the behavior has been reinforced. However the case with fireworks is a little different. This would be an example of counterconditioning. You should pair a positive stimulus with the fearful stimulus. So give treats and attention when fireworks happen. They realize when fireworks happen good things happen too. Thunder shirts provide comfort and can work great with mild fear of fireworks. Punishment though, is really never the first thing to go to and can really damage the human-animal bond. I bet he still barks at them though because he thinks he's being rewarded for barking at them as they passed by.","{'Sadness': 0.051869, 'Anger': 1.0, 'Analytical': 0.126, 'Emotional_Range': 0.902, 'Tentative': 0.364, 'Joy': 0.060169, 'Disgust': 0.085683, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.049, 'Fear': 0.985588, 'Openness': 0.187, 'Extraversion': 0.8, 'Agreeableness': 0.605}"

I live in San Francisco and I don't remember it being too contentious of a subject, but the Bay Area in general is dealing with the effects of extreme income inequality and gentrification right now. 

Plus some feelings might have changed after the clusterfuck that was super bowl city. Very true.  My highschool burned down in 1998.  It took us almost six months to even get textbooks.  We had to eat in circus tent half the next year.  There was even a proposal of taking all our money, building a brand new school on the rich side of town, and then give us the old school they were currently using in the middle of town.  They didn't even start building the new school a month before I graduated in 2000 because the idea of building a modern school on the poorer side of town was so controversial.  Granted it did only take a year to build from that point.  But I only had a school for two out of four years because of politics.Because the type of company hired to build a stadium consists of proactive doers.

Edited for those that needed help.> Why does it take a year to build a stadium

Because it doesn't. Taking a quick trip [over to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium), here are the key dates:

* 2007: Santa Clara starts working on project to build a stadium
* 2008: negotiations begin
* June 2009: agreement is made between 49ers team and city of Santa Clara
* December 2009: owners of Great America file lawsuit, which is dismissed
* June 2010: voters approve plan (Measure J).
* 2011: 49ers begin pre-sales of seats, boxes
* December 2011: Santa Clara secures funding
* February 2012: 49ers secure funding
* April 2012: groundbreaking at construction site
* July 2014: stadium opens

If you include everything, it basically took 7 years. Even if you forget all the planning and financing, construction itself took over 2 years, and obviously there would have been a lot of design work before that (probably going back to shortly after the Measure J approval).Maybe your school is full of vandals./r/ToMotivateYouBecause it took longer than 1 year to build Levis stadium.

So the graffiti is a lie.

So generally there are major pushes to have everything in place for stages to begin and end over the summer months when students are out of school.Money is part of it - but also harder work.

We are pumping out entire generations of children who ""graduate"" from high school with a 2nd grade reading level, absolutely no marketable skills, no hope for the future, living in bad areas filled with violent crime, and we are worried about a stadium?

It's only a matter of time until things get much, much worse around here.  We've already let things go for FAR too long, but when the AP students in a school only have teachers in 3 of their 7 classes in a day, what hope do any of them have at having a real life?

We have got a lot of work to do and meanwhile the deeply, **DEEPLY** racist people around here are all scrambling to find another major league team to come and let us pay for a stadium for them.

It's obscene how passionate some people are for sports in this city versus how utterly ignorant or apathetic they are about these important issues.  A few miles of freeway isn't going to protect us all forever and eventually, ignoring a huge swath of our population and basically relegating them to a life of poverty with the white flight epidemic in this area is going to come back to bite us HARD.

My aunt from overseas sent a book on endangered species.  I thought it was a brilliant gift for a time capsule.

Yes, there is roughly 100 left in other countries. But the minimum viable population for any species is generally between 50-150. That means this species is extremely close to being doomed to die out. I'm not associated with the WWF or any related organisations, and I would encourage anyone to do their own research before donating, but I hope at least one person will consider it. It should be changed to extirpated. They still exist in other areas of the world but have been extirpated in Malaysia [deleted]Why humans can't have nice things Way to go, humans.Humans are shit Goddamm dentists!Idk why but some small part of me is disgusted with my self as a human being for being on the earth and allowing this kind of shit to happen. There are still more Sumatran rhinos in Sumatra and Borneo.

And you'd think reddit hates China or something. Sumatran rhinos aren't often poached. And even if they are, Chinese people don't typically make viagras out of rhino's ivory.I'm just surprised the little guy has hair.Fuck humansJust to clarify why rhinos (in general) are going extinct, and why it will happen so quickly: Of course, one of the larger factors is poaching, and is probably one of the easiest for you all to donate towards. Because of this poaching, scientists have essentially been forced to breed rhinos in a way that does not promote genetic diversity (we don't want to say that they are essentially inbred, but they are almost clones of each other). Because of the lack of genetic variance, any small thing (diseases, disruption in food source, geographic dislocation, etc.) will pretty much wipe them off the face of the earth. 

Also, in case you didn't know, cheetahs are in the same boat. Although their numbers in the wild are relatively large at the moment, any small disease could wipe out wild cheetahs in the next year.One day in the future kids are going to find it hard to believe that animals once lived in the wild and that the wild used to consist of something more than a fucking Walmart parking lot. Just so some rich dudes in China can try to get their dicks hard.http://news.discovery.com/animals/endangered-species/sumatran-rhinos-now-extinct-in-malaysia-150820.htm

Good on him. A lot of people don't realize that bringing a cold animal inside the house only stops them from losing heat as fast, they still have to warm up via metabolism.

But the fact of the matter remains that . . . you feel an enormous amount of responsibility for these animals. If I knew that a calf had frozen to death slowly over the course of a day and a half, I would feel tremendous guilt. The feelings would be overwhelming. Soup's on!Bad memories... We'd put our animals together and every house will herd them respectively in our village. The herders were always some kids escorted by adults. But someday one of our neighbours decided that he could do on his own. The weather that day was very bad. And it was spring so there was always a chance of some sheep or cow giving birth.

When I returned home from school I saw my mom sitting by a little lamb and crying. The lamb was trying to get up so hard but she couldn't. She was shaking and falling down. She was trying again and again. It was very hard scene. Our fucked up neighbour thought that the weather would'nt heart the lamb if he just picked her up and hold her.

Dafoe has a certain kind of crazy look that befits Two Face's identity crisis a lot better. He pulled it off well with Green Goblin and a more comic-version of Two Face (who acts a bit different from movies and games) would suit Dafoe really well, I think.

He could probably do Joker crazy just fine too, but I think Two Face would end up coming out better.Simple, his dick is too big.Already been the Green Goblin.Easy - he doesn't want his ass kicked.

He'd be waaay too convincing and the next thing you know, the real Batman is showing up at his place throwing elbows and grunting all throatily. How about for a Batman Beyond movie?He can't be. He is simply not Dafoe Batman needs.Because it would terrify people. Someone hasn't seen [*Wild at Heart...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibCDxmMfbrY) **NSFW** *Spoilers*

http://spillmybeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-parking-problems-comic-picture.jpgWhen I was a kid my dog got really sick and we rushed her to the vet. My dad parked shittily like the guy in your pic because he was in such a hurry to get the dog looked at. The dog died while we were in there and when we left someone had left a note under my dad's wiper saying he was an asshole for parking like that. I never saw my dad look as defeated as he did in that moment.

TL;DR - You never know what someone else is dealing with. I'm getting a beer.[deleted]That is clearly a tortoiseKeep in mind, it is not fair to judge someone's parking ability if you don't actually watch them as they are parking. It is pretty likely that the car you are looking at was forced to park like this due to someone else being parked improperly next to them.In High School, the girl who parked in front of me was 1-2 feet into my spot EVERY FUCKING DAY. I just let it go, but by the end of the year, I was like whatever, I'll leave a funny note. 

""Just so you know  -- (insert drawn picture of a ruler with an arrow pointing at the 12 inch mark)

you were this far into my spot every day this year.

She then made a point to yell ""asshole"" out the window at me whenever she saw me from that point on -- obviously not finding it as funny as I did. This is an incredibly passive aggressive way to behave.

But the sad events did not stop there. Soon after, Yoina’s pet tamarin was killed when it overturned a boiling pot on itself. The family buried it.

He writes: Yoina aged nine with her pet saddle-back tamarin. Last year I was shooting an article for National Geographic Magazine on Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon. I had travelled deep into the park to a community called Yomibato, home to indigenous Machiguenga people (aka Matsigenka) as I wanted to look at how Manu’s indigenous people live within the world’s most bio-diverse national park. Every day Yoina and her friends would walk through our camp on the way to the river to swim. The monkey would come with her, even though it hated swimming. To escape the water the tamarin would always try to get onto Yoina’s head, where it felt more secure. Life for Yoina and the tamarin changed dramatically shortly after this image was taken. Their story and the story of Manu features in the June issue of National Geographic Magazine and on the NG website.

Merry Christmas to all of you in customer service and retail, and to the World's Greatest Postal Worker (if you read this, which I hope you do.)You did it! Congratulations! World's Greatest Postal Worker! Great job, everybody! It's great to meet you.When I was a kid, I knew the postwoman who came to my house very well. I'd always get excited when I saw her coming close to my house, and run inside to get a sippy cup of water for her to drink. She was always super nice to me, and one of my favorite people to see. 

When I was about 8, my family moved to a new house. Our grandparents shipped the gifts to our old house by mistake. However, that postwoman saw our names on the package right before Christmas and went above and beyond to track us down and get us the presents to us in time. 

If she hadn't been so amazing, we would have gotten our gifts weeks late - if we had gotten them at all. 

I've always had such huge respect for the postal service. They always do an incredible job. Sadly most people will not give a fuck, or understand.  They will just be mad they cannot send shit 2 hours before xmas, and have it delivered xmas.  - Signed someone working in an xmas gift store.Plot twist: The postal worker didn't post that, now has to cancel his plans to get this shit doneTwist: Steve Harvey was asked to write the note for the mailman.

It was one of the most surreal moments of my youth. the second photo captures just about everyone's reaction they would have if they just finished a tough climb and the skyline fucking exploded. I live in Washington and remember that day well. I was 13 years old. Myself and a friend had ridden our bikes a couple miles from home to go shoot our BB guns. We had gotten to our destination, taken a few shots, and saw some big dark clouds in the distance. Really big. Really dark. It looked like rain clouds so we started racing home trying to beat the downpour that we thought was coming. A couple minutes later the clouds caught up to us and it started snowing. Well, it looked like snow, but it was ash.  We couldn't really see very well by this point and it was getting pretty uncomfortable to breathe. We saw some headlights coming down the road and it was basically pitch dark at this point. The headlights stopped revealing a truck and the driver yelled at us to throw our bikes in the back and he would take us home. I remember we had been reading in school about Hiroshima and nuclear bombs, and I was pretty sure we had been nuked. The driver told us that ""Mount St. Helen's just blew up"" and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about but hearing the words ""blew up"" reinforced in my head that this was a nuclear war...or the start of one. Got home and saw the news.

That is how I found out that we have volcanoes in Washington and that I wasn't witnessing the start of World War 3.""Well, it's a good thing we didn't climb that one today.""I would just like to point out that in these pictures, Mt. St. Helens is 34 miles away. There had to have been some type of sonic boom that was out of this world seconds after they noticed the eruptionEven more intense are the [last photos from Robert Landsburg](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/234721-robert-landsburgs-brave-final-shots). 

""When the mountain exploded, he already had his camera on a tripod, aimed and cocked. As the all-engulfing cloud of ash climbed the sky toward him, four miles from the summit, he desperately cranked frames by frames across his lens, then rewound the film into its cassette inside the camera, wrenched the camera from its tripod, and stowed it in his backpack. His wallet was in the backpack too — perhaps to assure future identification.

Seventeen days later, his body was found in the ash, together with the film that cost him his life. It contained not only telling images of the killing edge of the blast but also the scratches, bubbles, warping, and light leaks caused by heat and ash, the very thumbprint of the holocaust.""I lived about 120 miles north, up in Snohomish, when it blew. Most of the ash ended up in Eastern Washington. [It turned day into night over there.](http://ecologicalsociology.blogspot.com/2010/05/it-was-30-years-ago-today.html)

edit: link My aunt and uncle struggled through the Great Depression then worked hard their entire lives. Finally they retired and built their dream retirement house on the banks of a river than flows from Mt. Saint Helens. Only a couple of months after moving in the mountain blew and they made it out with their lives with minutes to spare. Lost everything they owned except what they were wearing. Luckily their daughter had married a very rich guy and could take them in. But they never really recovered from the shock and died within a year or two after. I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time, and all I remember is that shit just about knocked me out of bed. Incredible BANG that shook the whole house, particularly my bedroom window. I hiked around Mt. Saint Helens in 1996, the side of the mountain that exploded was nuts.  There were areas where we were walking across fields of 1/2-inch round pumice that was deeper than you could dig, and then you would walk around a corner and be back in the forest for another few hundred yards, and then you would hit a line and back to the pumice field.  It was probably as close to walking on the moon as you can get without actually walking on the moon.  One of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.I watched it from our garage door about 30 miles to the upper left of this picture (meadow glade WA). Could never wrap my head around people selling the pens with ash in them...we could have made millions!Found this guy when reading up about this picture, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Randall_TrumanAny time I see Mt. Saint Helens photos I'm always reminded of Crater Lake (for obvious reasons). The crazy part is that native tribes were in the region when Mt. Mazama blew up to eventually become what we know as [Crater Lake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Crater_lake_oregon.jpg). Mt. Saint Helens was a huge deal even with the geology and volcano knowledge we have today. I can't imagine what had to be racing through their minds when Mt. Mazama erupted.

""Prior to its climactic eruption Mount Mazama had a summit elevation of about 3,700 m (12,000 ft). The present high point is Mount Scott at 2,721 m (8929 ft), 3 km (about 2 mi) east of the caldera rim. Today, the caldera rim ranges in elevation from approximately 2,040 m (6,700 ft) to 2,484 m (8,150 ft)""
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/crater_lake/crater_lake_geo_hist_133.htmlwhoa. thats terrifying. As a climber, theres always this thought in the back of your mind when you climb a volcano (even a dormant one) that it *could* erupt regardless of how incredibly unlikely that event is. Seeing this must have been a mix of emotions, awe, terror, dread, wonder, and concern for any one effected. 

Also, i'm 100% certain that those climbers were now facing extreme difficulty in returning to Seattle or Portland and were likely in danger from transportation/ash related problems. This is incredible. I don't think there's anything else to do at a moment like that except watch in awe.I was in Seattle when it blew and we all heard it. My dad and I flew from Seattle to California a couple hours later, and they changed our flight plan to go around it. I was a kid and didn't quite get the significance of what I was seeing, but my dad was jumping around in excitement climbing over people to get photos. He was a medical dr but his hobbies were geology and mineral collecting. (the mineral collection he spent his life collecting was donated to the Geology Department at UCLA and is in display cases lining the hallways of the geology building , if anyone is interested. Anyway, I think the guy in the window seat thought my dad was going to climb in his lap Would you stand and watch or run like heckDid they survive?If you're ever in the area be sure to visit Mt. St. Helens. It's a sight to behold and an experience you'll never forget.My first thought: ""And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.""AMA Request: that hiker person*Told he we should've climed Adams.*So when is mt.

I sure as hell hope that wall was designed to take the load and the rocks are supported to the lathe well.  Otherwise that thing is going to last 5-10 years tops.What exactly is used to hold the rocks in place...a certain kind of cement?In the boy scouts, they would warn us against using river rocks for our fire pit. I was told they can explode.This is by [Michael Eckerman](http://www.eckermanstudios.com/), [Here](https://www.pinterest.com/stacycats36/michael-eckerman-stone/) is some more of his stone work.The idea and execution are both really great, but the scale isn't good. It really overwhelms the house instead of fitting in and seeming like a part of it. Same thing but smaller would have been perfect.ITT: People who know about river rocks but not about fireplace/chimney construction. River rock is often used for fireplace surrounds and is easily found at many local landscape and decor specialty stores. The stones are not used directly in the fireplace where the heat is the highest. In addition, many stones are properly dried before being sold. 

They aren't wrong saying you shouldn't use river rock when making a camping fire. But, in this application, river rocks are completely fine and make for an aesthetically pleasing fireplace. It doesn't really matter what kind of stone it is as far as resisting heat.

Unless this was built some place that is completely wild west as far as building codes, this isn't a chimney and fireplace that is solely stone. There is a fireplace made out of fire brick and a specific heat resistant mortar. 

That feeds up into a smoke shelf which will be masonary and on top of that will be clay liners, wrapped in four inch block all the way up. There will also be four inch block providing the rectangular shape to lay the stone up to.

To sum it up: There is a clay liner that's an inch or more thick, a four inch block, at least an inch or two of space, then the four inch block exterior shell, another inch or two between the shell and the stone.

These stone are at least almost a foot away (with close to nine inches of heat resistant material in between) from any of that heat being produced in the fireplace and moving up and out through the chimney.and now there is a river with no rocks I admire the amount of technical skill and time put into this, but I think it looks really tacky. Nice idea, but the design make nauseous. I need order, sorry.Former mason laborer here - by far the funnest job I worked on was a huge entire house of irregular stone like this.  Basically it was a 2-month-long scavenger hunt, running from skid to skid looking for the right stone for the right spot.  Took longer and the rocks were harder to lift, but man it was a nice break from the monotony of brick-work.  And looked awesome when we were done!Nope. Sorry but it reminds me of the picture of the ticks in a dog's ear. I can't unsee that picture when I look at this chimney. I saw a picture once of a deer with hundreds of ticks in a group stuck to it and it looks like this fire placelooks amazing but how long do these actually last? the mortar will give way to weather and the rocks will fall out of place eventuallyi wonder what there is to stop rain from just falling right down and into your house.Looks like a hidden environmental puzzle from The Witness.These curves bother me. I like things that are square. I would be climbing that, in my childhood.Goddamn that's beautiful. That chimney is a work of art.Well that mustve been a labor of love cause that thing took forever...Amazing chimney!!!

Now that is one beautiful table.

So is it travertine or marble?how ""gripy"" is resin? like if you were to try to slide a glass across the table would it grip to the table?What kind of resin is that? 

I need to know. For reasons. Please.This is a lot like Greg Klassen's tables in wood and glass. I think Klassen's work is, overall, nicer looking though. It also involves more work to cut the glass to match the curves:

The kid on the right, on top of the van taking the picture, looks like it was photoshoped. I lived in South Africa for years. There is almost zero chance these are ""commuters"". This is almost certainly inside a park, and those cars are tourists specifically there looking for lions and other wildlife. Look at all the cameras. Lions don't just wander around Africa. They are very rare and highly prized tourist attractions, and they're in very specific, fenced (but extremely large, think hundreds, or even thousands of square miles) areas.

Africa is not huts and wildlife. Africa has cell phones and shopping malls and McDonalds and Adam Sandler movies, same as everywhere else.Nice BALLSMust not have been any dentists near the front of the lineNairobi is the only city in the world to have a national park right next to the city. People who live close to the park have at times encountered cheetahs and hyenas when coming back home from a night out. So yeah, lions can sometimes show up outside the park. But it isn't a common occurrence, though. TIL Nairobi drivers need laser pointers. Fucking cats man ... They do whatever they want and dont care who they inconvenience. Place a potted plant on a table in the middle of the Savannah with nothing around it for miles and you bet your ass a fucking lion will show up and knock it over.Those people in the front line of cars with their windows open, very ballsy.Lion 1:  They're totally looking at my ass aren't they?

[Shore breaks](https://youtu.be/EUXOZAinUPk)  
Other interesting facts about shore breaks.  
EDIT: Being from Hawaii I've thankfully learned how to duck dive under any wave, especially shorebreaks. As the name of the wave suggests, a shore break is a wave that breaks obviously close to shore. In my years of living in Hawaii I've probably seen a dozen of deaths because they either don't duck dive and get slammed from the peak down towards the sand or worse, rocks and reef. Another reason people die is that they stand at the bottom of the peak and get slammed with pounds of water causing back injuries or worse paralysis. It is fun to bodyboard or bodysurf these types of waves, however do it at your own risk. Learn to duck dive, never be afraid of a wave again.YEEZY YEEZY WHAT'S GOODI made this video piece about Clark a couple years ago, if anyone's interested in knowing a little more.

Someone educate me... what are the balloon-looking things?  Or are they bombs?  My Dad is somewhere in there. My grandfather was a medic on D-day. He dragged wounded and dead soldiers to the beach and loaded them onto medic boats. I'm going to see him in an hour and I didn't realize what today is until I saw this post. Thank you for reminding me to thank him. Probably the most insane logistical and engineering undertaking in history.an interesting thing about d day is the germans blew up all the docks and the allies anticipated this and build a floating dock that they could boat up to the beach which then served as a unloading point for all their shit... and the germans blew up their shit and the allies sailed their dock in and everything went way easier for the unloading process... it was called mulberry and when i saw this on the history channel the guy said it was one of the most innovative things about the invasionImagine what that must have *sounded* like.Might get buried, but I'm pretty sure that boat 2nd from the left was my grandfather's ship.  LST 309.  Crazy to think he is in the photo somewhereIn *The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant*, which may be the finest memoirs ever by a U.S. President, Grant devotes many chapters to the Mexican-American War and the U.S. Civil War. This is no surprise. However, to those unfamiliar with the text, it often comes as a surprise how much attention Grant devotes to *logistics*.  In popular imagining, new technologies like machine guns were decisive in the Civil War, but from the point of view of America's top general, such things weren't even worth mentioning. Victory resulted from being able to move his cannons and food to where he wanted them to be.[Meanwhile, back in America](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7493/15944038808_a049f08ec3_h.jpg)[deleted]
""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""

James doohanThis is an incredible and amazing photo.  Reading about the landings and that day and the horror of just the one battle, it's a mind blowing thought to me that as safe as these particular soldiers must have felt, they were just getting started with the war.

I can't comprehend how mentally taxing battle must have been.  If you survive, you know there's more coming.  In Stephen Ambrose's book ""D-Day,"" which I highly recommend, he compares the D-Day landings to taking every man, woman, child, vehicle, and supply in Green Bay, Wisconsin—everything in the entire city not bolted down—and moving it across Lake Michigan in 24 hours while under constant fire.Where are all those metal things that you usually see in movies depicting D-day.

That's because tourism visas don't exist in Saudi Arabia, and what's more you need a permit to travel up to this region to see the tombs, and the Saudis are not really willing to grant them because these tombs are pre-Islam.

It was before the Bears match yesterday[OP right after taking this picture](http://media.giphy.com/media/vJKeu2upniCSk/giphy.gif).Stealth - 11/10 

IGNI *just* finished two hours of reading about the development of the stealth bomber.  TIL:  That a scale model was made with the functional RCS technique and placed atop a $186,000 pole to make it high enough to fire radar at it.  When the radar returned only a blip for the pole, the operator sent guys to put the plane back on top, as it has clearly fallen off.  It had not.  

BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ALL 'MURICA. 

Unsatisfied, apparently, with seeing the blip of the pole...they ordered the design and construction of *a new pole made with stealth capabilities.*  They made an effin stealth *pole.*  No info on how many workers died running into it while setting it up.

Bonus TIL:  1)Stealth bombers were the first planes ever designed by a team lead by the electrical engineer.  2)When designing the shape of the plane, they created software to test for the desired effect on radar systems.  They were unable to even consider panels that were curved, as the the computers running the test algorithms would still be working on the results *today,* which is why they are flat.  This design and the total lack of traditional aerodynamics led to it being nicknamed Hopeless Diamond.  This could have so easily been photo shopped and I wouldn't even be mad if it was.Where was this taken?For all who say they need proof, this is as much as I can do, [the next shot](http://i.imgur.com/RNxF7re.jpg) in the HDR burst.

What lens and exposure time would you need for something like this?

Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

>All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hen’s oviduct. The journey through the chicken’s oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg.Wow, it's a very artistic photograph :DCould you possibly post a picture of each hen showing which egg is hers?

Keep pressing the issue, because the people responsible for this need to be held accountable. No slaps on the wrist this time. ""Back in 2016 I had to carry bottled water 5 miles uphill in the snow!""As shitty as the situation is little man looks sharp in the uniform.Fun story. I lived in Detroit for a summer in a house with no pipes and no electricity. It had been completely gutted. So no water, no working toilets, etc. It was pretty crazy but I grew up poor so it didn't feel as bad to me as it would for other people.

Background: my dad bought this house for hella cheap and moved out there. He knew what he was getting himself into and had plans to just rough it while he saved up to have the pipes re-installed, toilets and sinks and faucets replaced and get everything in working order. That never happened though. Life throws curve balls at us all the time. 

The summer of 2010, I went to stay with him since it was summer vacation from college. 

There was a lot of craftiness involved in living there. Being on my period was the worst. 

My brother (also lived there) and I would walk to the local library and brush our teeth there. We would stay from open until about 3 or 4pm and read and charge our phones. We were also able to use flushing toilets there. At home, we shat in plastic bags and then threw them away outside (tmi?) 

We were also able to get gallons of water at the store to bathe with. We would put water in little tin things (like for cooking bbq and stuff) and then use bar soap. We weren't the cleanest people but we weren't hella funky either.

My dad did splurge once when I was on my period and got me a room in a hotel so I could clean up properly. I was also able to wash my hair at the hotel which was nice. 

We didn't have electricity either. My dad and I slept on the floor in his room (brother was upstairs) and one day we went to RadioShack and bought a crank radio. We would listen to our favorite radio show at night. It was really nice. The sun set pretty late so we had a good amount of daylight to get stuff done. Whenever I would get home from the library, I would usually write or draw.

We ate a lot of fruit and bread and random snacks because we couldn't cook. My dad and brother also ate canned meats. 

It was a summer I'll never forget. It was actually one of my favorite summers in spite of everything. I knew that when I went back to school, I was going to miss Detroit. It's not the friendliest city in the world but for some reason the part I was in (the east side) felt kind of like the country to me. Things felt slower, homier, more neighbohood-y. It's hard to explain. But as much shit as people have to say about Detroit, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Most people don't know I've lived like this and wouldn't expect it. I'm kind of prim and proper at times and I'm about to get a master's degree. People with master's degrees don't shit in plastic bags!Gm refused to use it because it was corroding car parts...people expect flint residents to bathe in it?

Hhmm make it black and white and we are back to 1940 Maybe this is why we think old pictures looks so different. Because these are the photos that make it to the future. People in 2060 are going to think the same thing we're thinking now!Is this for showers, dish washing etc. as well?Stop commenting how much water that is for drinking. 

You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. That's a quarter bottle, per person, at least. You make your coffee. Two bottles. You drink it and wash your cup. That's at least a bottle of water to do that. Of course if you ate breakfast and your family ate too, you have to wash those, so bet on 10 bottles to do your dishes. You can take a shower, but the water is sort of blue today, which means the copper hasn't cleared the lines, and you broke out yesterday, so you just wipe up with a washrag. That's half a bottle. Per person. Minimum. If you need to wash your hair, that's an an additional 2-5 bottles, if you have long hair. 

You need to wipe down the counters, but you don't want to wipe lead onto them, so you use bottled water to clean up with, that's a bottle or 2. You water the dog, 2 bottles. THroughout all this, you've probably been sipping on a water bottle. 

You make spaghetti for dinner, that means 4 bottles for water for cooking, plus 10-12 bottles to wash out that many greasy pots and pans and rinse them, and you still have to wash everyone up for bed and get their teeth brushed, which is at least another three quarters of a bottle per person. 

Stop thinking of it as the drinking water allowance for the day. It's the only clean, safe, usable water in your home that can be used for anything but flushing your toilet, for the next 24 hours. Is that just *their* allowance or for the whole family? And wouldn't it be more efficient to distribute the water in gallon jugs?[Source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160209-flint-michigan-portraits-photography-lead/)please credit the god damn photographer.

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160209-flint-michigan-portraits-photography-lead/ #PureMichiganShit is fucking shameful.  Pardon my language and this isn't meant personally toward anyone but as someone from Flint, MI I say this:  Fuck off with using us as ""the state of America"" and all that.  Every 10 years we end up in the news for some ""look how the system has failed"" story and every time people act like they finally realize something needs to change.  None of you care in the bigger picture of it all.  A year or more down the road and you will have forgotten all about this and Flint will still be decayed and run down and left a shell of a city.  As shitty as this current situation is, it's been within a hair of this for DECADES.  This is just an interesting headline to the rest of the nation until it isn't any more.I apologize if this is not the appropriate place to post this, but I feel it may be useful since it's a highly visible post right now.

We are a band from Flint, MI (I currently live right downtown) called Sprowt.

Several bands, some from Flint and some outside of Flint, have contributed music to a $5 compilation album organized by Jonathan Diener (of The Swellers). 

100% of the proceeds are being donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint's Flint Child Health & Development Fund (flintkids.org).

If you're a music fan, please feel free to donate by buying the Not Safe To Drink: Music For Flint Water Crisis Relief compilation album at:

https://notsafetodrink.bandcamp.com/

The compilation album will be available on February 20th, 2016.

Thank you to everyone taking notice and doing something to help.

Put quite frankly, this whole thing sucks.Where can I donate?I can't imagine what I'd do if my kids had been permanently poisoned with lead. I'd go on a rampage.Flint is a disaster.  There's literally no quick fix and one that won't cost a huge amount of money.  Flint needs to be condemned and the residents should have their homes bought out at a fair market price before the crisis occurred.  100,000 residents + a quick google search showing that the average house price ~$100k = $10bn to buy out Flint. Probably a bit more than that, but in the ball park.  Shit, we spend way more to drop bombs on people in foreign lands every year.  I'm sure we can help 100,000 Americans out.

Source: wife works in produce at W-MIn Sweden its a common practice at most stores. It is almost only bananas since some customers decide to take one banana of the cluster. No one then picks the single banana and the store have to throw it away. This is a standard in Sweden, I haven't been to one supermarket which does not offer free fruit for children.In Seattle it was extremely common for supermarkets to allow/encourage kids to have a free piece of fruit while they were shopping with an adult.

She was an odd cat, but wonderful. Cats in general still amaze me because their domesticated form is just so close in behavior to the larger breeds that it is amazing. 

There is still a part of me that wants to believe I could have a giant cat as a pet. I know it's not true, it's cruel. I'd never partake in such a thing *but still* I want one, dammit. 

I don't know, after growing up around cats it is so hard to believe the big cats are hunted outside of the realm of self-preservation if you are attacked.

Billiard balls come in only two colours: white, and red (one of the whites has a small black dot)

2. That's clearly a pool ball.Gorgeous! How did you do it? Billiard ball is hard material.

How did you get the white out of it? Did you carve out the area & insert a white compound to carve afterward? I'm curious about the technique.

CEDAR FALLS (KWWL) -
The University of Northern Iowa Police Department are asking for your help for information regarding the whereabouts of Adam Sailor.

>Sailor was expected to participate in commencement ceremonies today but failed to attend.

>He is around 5’ 9” tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

>If you have information regarding Sailor or where he is located please call UNI Police Department immediately. 

>UNI Police Department: 319-273-2712Wait why was she flying in? Graduation is only a few days after finalsThanks for David Johnson!Fellow native Iowan here, glad to see my home state on the front page for some reason other than the primaries...This is why you can't say *all* of the education system in America is bad.ITT: Iowans getting stoked about finding other Iowans on Reddit.

Note: I too am from Iowa. I've been in the UNIdome many times. 
UNI is great - I just finished up my first year, and I love it. From the administration to students, it feels very tight-knit. I have the opportunity to work with administrators, and they genuinely care about students. Once in a while the president (Bill Ruud, at the left podium) will just wander around the union and talk to people, he invited student government to his house. A couple weeks ago the Provost (Jim Wohlpart, on the right podium) came to one of the student senate meetings, and we had a great discussion with him. 

And he signs his emails with an interesting signature, ""Awe & Wonder"".
Honestly that really considerate of them.

At my graduation the women's lacrosse team was away at some championship game and came two hours late, and the faculty tried to make everyone stay. People were getting restless and tried to leave but they would get up and tell the students that it was mandatory to stay. 

Eventually they got there, instead of lining up and getting their diplomas they wanted their names called one by one so they could make a grand entrance and high-five people. They got booed instantly.Is the ceremony so important? I mean... I'm in Europe, but when my graduation ceremony was organized I had already moved to another city and started working, so I just declined the invitation. 

It's just an event, as far as I know :3Was surprised seeing UNI on Reddit... I completed my Master's there. I never thought I'd end up in Iowa, but can't think of a bad thing to say about UNI or Cedar Falls.

Except the -40 degree wind chills. Fuck those.Isn't UNI the school that gave us The Interlude dance a few years back?  
God bless that campus. /r/iowa

This is Iowa nice. Recent Iowa state grad here. Uni is great.UNI alum here, love to see this story! UNI fight!You wouldn't happen to go by the Kamerick building much would you? Because Dr
Kamerick is my grand dad.I challenge *anyone* to name a group of people nicer than the god damn Iowans! UNI is a stand up university. Wow! The president of my school left as soon as she finished giving the opening address! Must be nice...As an Iowan, UNI (University of Norther Iowa) is used quite a bit. I'm confused on the internet when people say uni short for university. Graduate as of today, go Panthers! Incredibly professional.  

I feel  like my Alma Mater would have found a way to charge me money or withhold my degree for missing mine.UNI Fight!Wow reading the title I thought maybe they delayed the graduation for 45 minutes and I was like wow that's very nice, but I feel the pain for the audience having sat through a lot of graduations myself. They are very long and grueling for the audience. Although they stayed 45 minutes AFTER the whole ceremony huge props to them. That's insane. Am I crazy or is 45 minutes not that long to wait?

Americans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.  But I think in many cases a revolution just replaces the current bad players with a possible set of worse players. 

I'd love to see a history of overthrown governments and whether the common people were better or worse off after it.

As much as I thought we had it bad for weather, SD was just ridiculous. It gets hotter in the summer, colder in the winter, and the storms (winter and summer) are wilder. Snow plows running every week, signs getting blown off buildings, flickering lights, snowing in October and May, rain clouds that looked like armageddon. They were beautiful, though. Like the people from Independence Day looking up at those ships in awe as the beam gradually forms and decimates everything.As a South Dakotan I love whenever my state gets some attention everyone from there likes to jump in and chime Oooh Im from South Dakota!

The midwest is a terrifyingly beautiful part of America.I have experienced one of these South Dakota summer storms, probably around about this time of year, too. We were camping in Badlands NP. Temps had reached 116 that day, too hot and humid to move. That night, the bellowing wind bent the tent sideways; after we'd held it up from the inside for what seemed like an hour, we made a run for the car, sleeping bags in tow. From there we were witness to an almighty thunderstorm, lightning striking all over the visible sky, as a backdrop of 80s rock songs played on the car radio. The storm finally passed around 6am, and we returned wearily to our tent, which had somehow survived. It was terrifying at the time, but made for an amazing adventure for two Brits not used to such monumental storms! We loved our time in and around the Black Hills.*What a glorious day!*Yay!

There wasn't. There was a note to parents, but it didn't express anything about gender.
  
But it was cool to see these Legos that haven't been opened since 1981. I mean shit, I was 2-3 when this was on store shelves. The brick walls are thicker than they are today. But the sets today are better by far. AND SPCAE LEGO!!! Shit, that brings me back. I mean, my whole Lego room brings me back, but to see ads in the booklet brings me back.

Boys play with Barbies, girls play with GI Joe, I'll make fun of them for playing with lame toys, not for playing with the wrong gender toy.
  
The fucking Danish got it right with Lego, and Danishes, and they're right. Who gives a fuck?! Maybe they thought by 1981, when this set was made, that they didn't need to insert pamphlets telling parents to not be assholes. Because rthe Danish weren't assholes in 1981.
  
Lego rules. Build whatever the fuck you wanna build, and don't be a dick parent telling your kids what to build. Fuck you and your dying asshole ways. WHO WANTS TO COME OVER AND DRINK AND BUILD WHATEVER THE FUCK??!?!?!!?
  
edit: you want more pictures of the box? just ask. I'll be up for a while.
  
EDIT: Okay, now I'm awake and sober, and can asses what I have done. The set isn't really that valuable, and I got it as part of a massive 390 set haul last year. I kept it for its historical value. The pieces are bagged in the perforated bags from back in the day, and they make that distinctive sound when you shake them. I love that sound. All I did was cut one of the seals to open it, and I don't regret it. This set is a time capsule and should be opened to see that booklet.

Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this. A Lego designer explains how the company survived: http://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1x6ldp/lego_franchise_infographic/cf8vdl3

Edit: You know, I'm really tired of older former Lego builders claiming Lego didn't produce pre-packaged sets with instructions in ""the good old days."" Unless your ""good old days"" were prior to 1978, those sets you sniff at, the ones that told you how to build spaceships with special parts? They were around: http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/year-1978 

Edit 2: Corrected the first link. http://i.imgur.com/afnTUMC.gifThis sucks balls. I tried to enter a Lego building competition at a local mall. I was a skinny little kid with long blonde hair. They told me that ""girls weren't allowed to enter"". I'm still emotionally damaged from that one, cos I was a Lego master.I'm a girl...and I wanted pink Legos. Why didn't they have pink Legos when I was a kid? Why is that so hard? Can anyone else make out what's written [on the back of the sheet](http://i.imgur.com/y5yLayE.png)?  

All I can make out is:

What was the building years ago/what were they expecting to find?Sometimes I wish I was a archaeologist. Finding things like this must be the best feeling in the world.

Greek student here. If anyone's interested, here's who they are. I should note, however, that the separate divisions of the muses weren't agreed upon till the end of antiquity.

In the center is Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. I'm assuming she's in the middle because they considered epic the highest poetic genre. Below her in the bottom right corner, Cleo, the muse of history. To the left, Urania, muse of astronomy. Then Polyhymnia, the muse of sacred poetry. Then Erato, muse of lyric poetry, specifically love poetry (her name is related to the word ""erotic""). Then Terpsichore, muse of dance and the chorus. Then Melpomene, muse of tragedy. Then Thalia, muse of comedy.  Then Euterpe, muse of elegiac poetry.
It looks like it was buried under white pumice from a volcanic eruption.

>The ancient city of Zeugma was originally founded as a Greek settlement by Seleucus I Nicator, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, in 300 BC. The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000 inhabitants.

http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/11/11/mosaics-revealed-at-ancient-greek-city-of-zeugma-in-turkey/I'm surprised by all the sediment/ (for the lack of a better word) stuff that ended up on top of it over the years. Although I know 2,000 years, plus or minus half a millennium, is a lot of time for the accumulation of sediment/stuff to take place, I didn't realize several feet/ meters could pile up that fast. [Touched it up a bit.](http://imgur.com/Z4SbgUO)It makes me so happy to know there are still things in the world to be discovered.I was excited when i tore up a carpet and found a hardwood floor. Now i know that was bush league.Wow, can't imagine the feeling you must get discovering this yourself. HOW CAN IT BE GREEK IF ITS IN TURKEY IM ONTO YOU LIBERALS DONT TRY TO PLAY ME I KNEW A MAPPLEASE dont let ISIS find it...

Edit: ok, folks, I'm not a novice when it comes to geography, history and current events.   I said that because ISIS is right across the border on Syria, and heaven forbid, they make their way into Turkey somehow.   We see Russians in the Ukraine so why is spillover totally impossible?  I mean no offense to Muslims in general, but ISIS has history of destroying works of art, monuments and historical sites in towns it makes a home in.   Man, reddit, you are fickle and easy to insult a total stranger.   First time I've been called a ""knuckle dragging mouth breather"".

Edit #2:  Alright, let me justify the comment/joke behind what I said.  Current (2 week old information) shows that [ISIS holds the boarder area of Turkey in Syria and the northern end of Iraq.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0).  [That's about 25 miles/40 km](http://imgur.com/E1PqDqE) to the site where that mosaic is being uncovered...Not really far.  Of course its a stretch to say ISIS will invade Turkey anytime soon.  But sheesh man, they're right there at the doorstep.  Chill out people.This will probably get buried but I work for the Biblical Archaeology Society and we did a short piece on this last week. This is from Zeugma, an ancient trading center that was the only point traders and travelers could cross the Euphrates. The name literally means ""bridge"". In the 90s turkey built a dam farther down the river and submerged 30% of the site underwater. They've been excavating since 2000 and this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. I think it's worth pointing out that these mosaics actually date to the 2nd or 3rd cent. A.D., so at a glance, they are about 1,750 to 1,850 years old, rather than 2,200, as has been reported in the media.
([Here is a good source](http://www.ccaroma.org/en/zeugma-conservation-mosaics) for more reliable info, if anyone's interested.)

There were definitely some very stunning and intricate polychrome mosaics in the Hellenistic period; it might even be considered the height of the craft.  But there are some stylistic differences that set the later mosaics apart.  That includes things like the heavy borders, the interlocking geometric patterns, the use of large(-ish) tesserae, the heavily rounded and shaded facial features, etc.
You can compare them, for example, to [these other 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics](http://followinghadrian.com/2014/10/15/roman-mosaics-from-the-national-archaeological-museum-of-spain-madrid/) from Spain.

Interestingly, it's thought that the interlocking geometric 'panel' designs in some mosaics might have been designed to imitate the elaborate panelling of the ceilings in the rooms where they were laid.

Gorgeous mosaics!  So nice to see that they've been spared the flooding that's overtaken so much of the site.

[Edit]  P.S. Also note some of the qualities I listed for 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics are common to Hellenistic mosaics, too (compare the Zeugma pavements to the [Alexander Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#mediaviewer/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) from Pompeii, for example (ca. 100 B.C.).  An art historian can probably add to this better than I can, but some of the differences are kind of ineffable to pin down.Oh man, crosspost over to /r/AncientCivilizations, they'd love this!They used sealer.awesomeIn Gaziantep, the closest major city to the archeological site, there's a state of the art ""mosaic museum"" that showcases finds from Zeugma. 

I was there a few months ago and had a blast. Southeastern Turkey is completely safe and refreshingly light on on other tourists, making you the recipient of a lot of warm hospitality from the locals.

Got some great night shots on the tripod but no sun rise.Hey, really nice shot! [I got a similar result on Mt. Meru in Tanzania](http://i.imgur.com/QOMhvx4.jpg).

He proceeded to seriously bank the plane (felt like 30-35 degrees!) to give everyone a good view since we were flying more close to directly over the top.

That's the most I've ever felt a commercial flight banked to one side.  My face was smashed against the window and people were holding on to the armrests to not smash the people next to them.

I thought it was beautiful that someone that flies 100+ hours a month and has probably seen 100% of the country from 30,000+ feet countless times still acknowledges the beauty and shared it with everyone.

Wait, even better, we should start a line of bottled water that has like a single.oyster sitting in the bottom of the bottle. We can call it... H2Oyster**Window washers hate this secret!**Ocean acidification is threatening oysters.  Larval oysters are having a harder time forming their shell. This is a good way of showing why this matters. The conclusion I draw from this is that I should never eat oysters again.Unfortunately, you'll not see the water quality benefits of oyster reintroductions. Attempts at creating safe populations, where they can breed and increase their numbers fails as oyster fishermen poach every bed they find. 

Sources: I attended the Marine Estaurine Environmental Sciences program at Univ Maryland at the Chesapeake Bay.So I should put oysters in the bottom of my bong?THANK YOU.
Now the other fucking post i was reading with the 2 army tanks makes a HELL of a lot more sense now.
I've been thinking about it for the past 20 minutes and couldn't understand why i was so fucking confused =sIf the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay was what it historically was, it would filter the entire bay's volume of water in 3 days. The oyster population is so low now that it takes over a year. Can the oysters also predict the World Series winner?Oysters are great. I organize an effort in my town to create oyster mats. These mats are chained together in specific areas of the river and foster new oyster beds by giving the larvae a place to attach to. If we get enough growth, it may have a positive effect on our river's water quality. Each oyster can filter 50 gallons a day of water and they are a keystone species of many ecosystems.This isn't as clear-cut of a comparison as the image wants you to believe. The water being clear isn't an indication of ecological health any more than being murky is. Murky could be pollutants, but it could also be algae. Algae are necessary to the ecosystem. The water on the right appears stripped of algae because the oysters eat it. That's good up to a point, and then it starts being a problem.

If I showed you this exact same image using lake water and zebar mussels, it would be a demonstration of the ecological damage done by invasive zebra mussels.That's where the flavour comes from.Question: Can I get oysters and put them in a fish tank with my fish and never have to clean the water again? Or at least not clean it so often?I can't look at this without being horribly reminded about getting norovirus from oysters a couple of years ago, and this pic kinda makes it a bit clearer just how easy it is for them to pick up bacteria from the water. I've never been so ill in my adult life and haven't been able to eat oysters since! From my intense studying and observations, the water with the oysters seems to be cleaner.

They come from my great-uncle, who did serve in the 201st squadron. I am just a distant nephew, and my uncle's family treasures all these memories, not just as memento, but also because they, and my family (my father served with them in a special forces group) still serve to this day with a lot of pride and honor, and with this legacy in mind.


You'd be healthily skeptic to doubt me in light of all the drug trafficking, corruption and violence levels in the country, even within the military; but boy, would I be fucking damned if I let anyone slip every Mexican soldier under that umbrella.



The stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.


The reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:


Mexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.

You can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.



But just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.


It could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.


Sure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.



Let's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.

I just got patriotic for a country I am not from. I guess propoganda works.Great post OP. On a similar note, Alot of mexican americans fought in WWII but at the time there was only ""white or black"" on the census. Natrually mexicans where considered white (and many still do idenfity as such).

 This is part of why i enjoyed fury because it really made effort to be accurate in what was out there./r/propagandaposters has tons of stuff like this.'Muric...I mean...'Mexica?!Notice the two mountains in the background? Those are actually volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. They are very important to Aztec mythology. Legend has it Iztaccihuatl was an Aztec princess who fell in love with Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl was sent off to war, she was falsely told by her father that her beloved had died in battle, so in turn she died of grief. When the warrior returned to find his lover dead, he laid her to rest and kneeled beside her body to mourn her death.Here's a good write up on the 201st squadron. [Strike of the Aztec Eagles] (http://www.airartnw.com/aztec_eagles_story.htm) I picked a up a print a while back with the signatures of the few remaining pilots. If I were a Nazi - I'd be wondering where the rattlesnake went.  As I learned from WWE, don't turn your back on a rattlesnake.Aaaaand.... I have a new wallpaper vMexico declared war on the Axis Powers in support of the Allies on May 22, 1942, following losses of oil ships in the Gulf, most notably the Potrero del Llano and the Faja de Oro, to German submarine attacks. Although most American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and Brazil were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.

Perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the Mexican military was the Escuadrón 201, also known as the Aztec Eagles. This group consisted of more than 300 volunteers, who trained in the United States to fight against Japan. It was the first Mexican military unit trained for overseas combat.

I remember those days. I got so pumped to get a Princess Diana beanie baby. What's it worth now? Probably jack shit. Poor couple. 

Edit: Just to clarify,

""Pumped to get"" entails being 12 and having one thrown at me out the window of a car by the kid who's mom owned a local toy store. He had boxes full and to be one of the people to catch one was indescribable. It felt like I just got tossed a chunk of gold. I'm just trying to figure out which one's gonna get $14.56 and which one's gonna get the $14.57.This is a really beautiful photograph. It's so raw. These adults seem to have forgotten they are in a courtroom picking their pieces of their broken marriage. 

They look just like children, but all grown up. The gentleman challenged his ex-wife's custodial rights to their Tomagatchi when he found no less than 4 poops on the screen during his court-supervised visit.It would be hilarious if in a few decades Beanie Babies started auctioning for hundreds of dollars each simply because so many people threw away their ""worthless collectibles"". And everyone(me included) that made fun of them were mad because they didn't buy them when they could.Just wait till they get to the pokemon cardsNever thought I'd open reddit to see my aunt and uncle on the front page. It is just as embarrassing now as it was then. Buying Beanie Babies on eBay was the most 1999 thing you could possibly doFor the curious, [here's](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/beanie_babies_bubble_economics_and_psychology_of_a_plush_toy_investment.html) the article I found the picture in.Both must cringe at the sight of this now. Man, I know too much about Beanie babies, and it sticks in my head like a steal trap. A few years ago, a girl said to me, ""my birthday is on November 6, and I said to her, you share a birthday with Pouch the Kangaroo."" So, for anyone who doubts what I'm about to say, I think I have the ruinous resume for this.

This collection of Beanies is hilariously terrible. Almost none of these were ever of any value. I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, so it's clear that these two were collecting to strike it rich. They weren't collecting just to have them. I see a lot of Legs the frogs. They had a little bit of value at one point, and when Chocolate the moose retired (which you can see a couple of, it jumped in value a little as well. But they were not big money makers. It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow. Rainbow and Iggy were released with their tags switched and body parts all messed about. There were a couple releases of each before Ty got it right. That said, it's pretty clear that she knows what she's doing, and he might be a moron. In her pile in th elower left hand corner, she has a Flip the cat, and (I think though it's hard to say for sure) a Dotty the Dalmation. Those two were pretty valuable after they were retired. Probably the most valuable in this collection presuming that the Lucky the Ladybug sitting in the middle of the pile is a later generation version of the Beanie. Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time. If it's a Doodle, I'm guessing at the time, I'd grab that. If it's a Strut, I'd go for the Crunch the Shark. In the end, Crunch would have been better, but Doodle was what everyone was speculating on.Not even Beanie Baby collectors can stand to be around Beanie Baby collectors.Apparently putting your hand to your face and sticking your finger on your mouth was quite the fad in 1999.I don't even care.  I'll say it.  As a kid who loved stuffed animals, these things were the shit.  There was one for just about any animal you could want.  Played with these things every day till I grew out of them.  Think they're still in a box in a closet somewhere around here.Can you imagine the Judge going home after this?

But maybe there's some comfort in knowing he helped so many others, which would be a feat for anyone, let alone an 11-year-old. He was still a child, and it would have been absolutely understandable if he'd thought of himself first. Very powerful picture.Signing up to be an organ donor is basically the easiest thing you can do to help save lives -- everyone should be an organ donor. This little boy is an example to us all.holy shit, death being the catalyst of life. no better way to end one's journey than by allowing others to continue theirs. My sister passed away recently.  She was an organ donor, and everyone involved in that process was incredibly respectful, compassionate, and above all grateful for her decision.  She saved the lives of several people directly, provided organs for research, and tissues which could wind up helping 100s of people.  As bad as it all was, it's some small comfort knowing that her death wound up helping others.[More information about this great human being in case anyone is interested.] (http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/11-year-old-chinese-boy-donates-organs-to-save-others.html)I always thought you couldn't donate if you had cancer?Relevant XKCD :

http://xkcd.com/659/To see these people bowing to a boy donating his organs, is such a powerful image. I got chills all over my body. the respect they have is so immense.Much respect to this young guy.I find it amazing how something as simple as a few people arching their backs in your direction can mean more than a thousand words of thanks.  
It's like a primitive way of showing appreciation from before we were able to communicate with words.  
It's also great seeing such a positive piece about China. Seems to be in an almost permanent state of negativity these days.  
Respect.I'm not sure if this is relevant, but here goes: 

My close friend took his life three months after he turned 22. Everyone was devastated and so caught off guard. He was so loved. Anyway, during his funeral I was so upset that I didn't think there was anything that could be said that could take away my grief. Well, I was wrong. He was an organ donor. They were able to use pretty much every single organ from the neck down and his eyes. The pastor of the funeral told us that because of his death, his eyes allowed a child to see for the first time. Whoever that kid was is so lucky, his eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue. Miss you, buddy.

 There's nothing that can take the pain away, but I hope for this child's family, the knowledge that he has given others a new chance will help. This will probably get buried but when I was in high school I had a friend who suffered brain damage after being hit by a car while he was crossing the street. He lived for the following three days before his death. He, too, was an organ donor, and the day after his death a story was reported of an anonymous 18 year old boy who had donated his liver to save a young girl. We all knew it was his. Following his death he donated any organ possible, from his heart to his kidneys to his corneas. He was a healthy young man whose death made an immediate and powerful impact on other people's lives. It's a sad but bittersweet story that I'll never forget. Most of the school followed through and became organ donors soon thereafter. RIP Robb. fuck...its too early to feelHere's the whole story in Chinese with more photos, if you guys are interested in, I will try to give a brief translation

Edit: Very rough one, please forgive any typos and grammar mistakes

The boy’s name is **Yaoyi Liang**. He came to Shenzhen (close to Guangzhou) 2 years ago with his older brother and sister, who are seeking jobs in this metropolitan.

04/12/2014, his sister noticed Yaoyi was having slight movement disorder, and even fell out one time. Yaoyi was sent to hospital immediately next morning, the examination told that it was brain cancer. The family originally thought modern medical technology could save the little boy, however, after 2 surgeries on 04/16 and 05/08 respectively, things didn't get any better.

Yaoyi had been dreaming to become an astronautic scientist/engineer before he was diagnosed the illness. However he changed his mind, he hoped that if he could recover, he would try his best to be a doctor to help relieving the pain of others. During the period, he showed incredible maturity, never really complains the pain but tried to comfort his mother. 

When it came into June, Yaoyi himself seemed to realize it was coming to the end. He said to his mom:” if I can’t survive, please donate my body.” The family came from rural area in China, his mom who was under-educated, can’t really get what her boy was talking about. And then she realized. At the beginning, his sister was strongly against the idea, as per Chinese tradition, it is peaceful only when whole body is buried. After some time, the family understood, that was also another form of living in this world.

06/06, 11:45 AM, Guangzhou Zhongshan 1st Hospital, relatives of Yaoyi were called; 4:35 pm, Yaoyi peacefully passed away. 5:19pm, Yaoyi’s kidney and liver were collected, and would have transplant to others within 8 hours to save their lives. Yaoyi has become the 142th multi-organ donator in Shenzhen.
I wasn't aware that cancer patients could donate their organs. Are there not concerns about unknown metastasis, circulating tumour cells or circulating free DNA?

Edit: I read further into the thread and this is discussed, never mind! What was his name? This picture is amazing and this child deserves the dignity of his name being known Way to go kid. I'm very proud of youEvery day I come to Reddit for laughs and leave with tears. Reddit is the first ten minutes of Up in constant loop. My grandma received a heart from a young man who died when dove off a pier.  This was in the 90s and they told her she only had about 5 years to live with it and everyone else who did the program.  Thankfully she was given another 18 years.  This was enough to see me be born and grow up. Although she unfortunately passed away a year before I graduated high school, I am so glad I got to know her.  Without someone donating their organs that would have never happened.  Every year my grandma would have a second birthday on the young man that gave her the heart's birthday.  She would go to his grave and release a heart shaped balloon.  Powerful. I wish it was higher resolution so I could frame it and hang it up at my uni accommodation. Pictures like this push me through med school.An 11 year old makes the decision to save as many lives as he can, in the face of impending death. I can't get most full grown adults I know to make a reasonable decision if their life depended on it. This young... child, hero, saint... whatever you call him, had little knowledge and experience of many of the truly wonderful joys and experiences of life, yet was wise enough, and kind enough to ensure others to get a chance he never will. Its much too bad that with type of selflessness and concern for fellow man this child held, that he didn't get many more years to make the world a better place. We need more people like him.I haven't felt this sensation of moisture coming out of my eyes in a while. It's not sadness, it's more a deep sense of respect and admiration.

The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so ""floats"" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions.Almost 6,000 years of geological history right there!

The [Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome) is the first domed stadium, and has been sitting unused for about a decade. 

I personally think this is a great idea. Houston is a huge metro area (4th most populous in the country) but lacks a world-class amusement or water park since Six Flags closed. And the summers here can be unbearable, so going indoors is a great idea. Now who's paying for it? That'll be an issue of course.This is not an *old* airship hangar. The building was finished in November 2001. It belonged to a company called CargoLifter that wanted to build freight airships but went bankrupt before any airship was built. They basically only built the hangar and a few hot air balloons for testing.  
  
After that the hangar was re purposed as this waterpark.

[Edit: Looks like it](https://vimeo.com/61845373)This hangar was actually built in 1998, and has nothing to do with the nazis or hindenburg. it was built for an airship project called Cargolifter, which would have been used to transport extremely heavy things into and out of berlin. Before they built the zeppelin they noticed that this could not work, because as soon as the cargo would have been released, the airships high bouyancy ( to lift the several-ton Cargo) would have catapulted the ship up. But the hangar was built anyway. I cannot recommend the park in it, its horrible because there is no sky, and very non-tropical lightingThat middle part could be turned into lazy river. Not really old. It was built in 2000.

I did not take this photo!! I found it on /r/newsokur. More people needed to see this.

This seems to be the source! but I am not too sure, anyone speak the language? : http://nurullah.net/article/Keske-Hep-Cocuk-Kalabilsek.htmlI know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it.Survey says...""This is not a camera""I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it?Those hats are adorable.I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this ""camera"". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. ""excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?"" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were ""taking pictures of people in their homes"" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police.I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, ""take my picture!  take my picture!""  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a ""hey, come here and look at this..""  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.  That is so fucking cute.I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were ""Are you guys about to widen the road"" and ""Don't take my picture with that"". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.  lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses. I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. ""Oh taking pictures, smile!""

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave. We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, ""It's actually not a camera."" Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, ""Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures."" With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole. I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!  Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks ""how do you ride that thing?"" I replied with ""I clinch my cheeks real tight.""Aw thats adorable!Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background.I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: ""I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera"". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off.I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.  Which would probably be the most boring subreddit.Used to annoy the hell out of me when I was working with a surveyor, ""Do you wanna take my picture?"" No, it's a theodolite, it does not take pictures, it measures angles and distances, and even if it WAS a camera, why on earth would I want a picture of you?I have always wanted to know what one actually sees when looking through one of those.

Link related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter

Also, I heard a story of a student who was in a class where the teacher allowed students to only write on one side of a sheet. He twisted the sheet and attached it to itself as a Möbius strip.I always loved note-card allowed exams. I thought I was getting one over on the teacher (Hah! I wrote suuuuper small, take that!) but I always ended up learning more of the material because I actually spent time studying by putting together my card.I had a classmate in high school peel the index card apart into layers and then print off typed notes to paste on each layer. The kid ended up with like 5 extra sides on his notes. The teacher was so astounded that a 16 year old would think of this that he allowed the kid to use the note card.  From then on out, that teacher clearly stated that this isn't allowed. Talk about interpretating the rules haha.

PS: Forgive my grammar mishaps (I know its interpreting), as the drunken redneck within me came out last night.My Differential Equations professor always used to say, you may use one piece of paper. If you are creative enough, you can use all 6 sides.When they wear them on each eye the answers pop out in 3DThis kid is going placesWhy the hell aren't they printing a 3x5 notecard in 3 point fonts and bringing reading glasses?Story time:

There was a legend in the math department at my college that a professor allowed students to use an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper full of notes for the final exam.  The only problem was that the prof didn't specify units of measurement so some smart-ass (or possibly genius) student got a hold of a sheet of butcher paper that was 8 1/2 FEET by 11 FEET.  Since the prof hadn't specified units of measurement, he ended up letting the kid use it, but from then on he always made sure to say that an 8 1/2 INCH by 11 INCH sheet of paper could be used for notes on the final.

I will say that your student's method of bending the rules is far more creative and less smartassy than the student in my story.I did something similar, except for a multivariable calculus final. We were allowed both sides of a 5"" × 7"" notecard. So I wrote out my notes first horizontally on the card, then turned the card 90° and wrote in a different color on both sides again.
So long as you use colors that are markedly different and not too dark, it works well.So that kid gets an A for being a genius right?The thing I remember most about these notecard style exams is that most of the stuff I wrote down I ended up remembering just from the act of taking the time to write it.  I ended up just using the card to double-check stuff so I didn't feel I made it in vain.Where was this post a couple days ago? I could have used this on my final.I had a teacher specifically forbid this because she had seen it before. Playing with legos all the time (and hunting for the right color part in a mixed bin) as a kid developed in me the ability to ""blur out"" all colors but the one I'm looking for. I have done this with six colors and no lenses.

""A"" for creativity, but abject failure for the crime of NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. My teachers in college said that we could use our books during the exam. Whenever that happened, everyone realized that the exam was going to be so hard that the books wouldn't even be helpful. Sadly to say, this was indeed the case.A teacher once told my class to ""only use a 3 by 5 note card."" My best friend came in with a huge piece of paper made of other papers taped together with most the chapter written on it. The teacher asked what he thought he was doing so my friend explained that she never specified 3 by 5 inches and that his paper was 3 by 5 feet. He said it was still 3 by 5 so he was still following the rules. She let him get away with it but never forgot to say inches after that.","{'Sadness': 0.31355, 'Anger': 0.826095, 'Analytical': 0.208, 'Emotional_Range': 0.713, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Joy': 0.041794, 'Disgust': 0.938878, 'Confident': 0.106, 'Conscientiousness': 0.254, 'Fear': 0.783487, 'Openness': 0.402, 'Extraversion': 0.404, 'Agreeableness': 0.6}"

This is a great example showing why honey bees die after stinging something only once. Their stinger/venom sac are attached to other organs inside the bee, so when the stinger's barbs lodge into something, everything gets pulled out, potentially including gut, etc and leaving a gaping hole in the bees abdomen.

Another interesting fact: the stinger that gets left behind is composed of the stinger/barb, the venom sac, a layer of muscle tissue surrounding the venom sac and a nerve ganglion attached to the muscle. Independent of the bee, that nerve ganglion continues to contract the muscle around the venom sac, pumping more and more venom into the victim even if the bee has run off.  This is why when you get stung by a bee, you want to scrape the stinger out ASAP with a flat tool. (Don't try to pull it out with your fingers, you'll just squish the venom sac and empty it all in at once).[deleted]If I ever have a metal band, this will be the cover to my album.Spiderman.  Venom.

[It looked like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Comptometer_model_E.png), but the copper body was pretty heavily tarnished and almost black like a really old worn penny. However, it still worked. After taking everything apart (there were hundreds of individual parts: springs, levers, gears, etc.), lubricating everything and polishing the copper shell it looked even better than the photo above, like a shiny new penny. It was incredibly impressive to see how such a complex device was put together (and very satisfying to be able to take it apart and put it back together without screwing it up!). I took photos of the inside, which I don't have access to right now, but [here's an internet pic of the inside with the shell taken off](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/08/comptometer_interior.jpg).

-don't slam on your brakes (additionally: check your car manual if your car requires brake pumping or not)

-before braking, let up the gas first for about 2 seconds before using the brake pedal

-increase your braking distance significantly compared to dry conditions. You will slide if you attempt to stop at what may seem a reasonable rate normally and lose control (thanks, /u/my_dog_is_cool)

-keep a cars length between you and driver in front of you when stopped

-if you know you are going or about to go over a bridge, don't accelerate or brake unless you need to (bridge ices before road)

-accelerate while going up hills

-don't ever break going up hills

-don't ever use cruise control

-if the light turns green before you approach the intersection (meaning you did not make a full stop yet), proceed with caution (someone from the previous light might still slip in the intersection on accident)

-look both ways when the light turns green before proceeding

-keep the top of your car free of snow (for drivers behind you)

-keep the hood of your car free of snow (for your benefit when that wind blows)

-put your emergency blinkers on the moment you are seriously stuck

-wear sunglasses during the daytime (you'll see outlines of curbs and medians better)

-never use your brights (it's like a million mirrors blinding you)

-Dr. Seuss, the Croc in the YardGators gonna gait.Interior crocodile alligatorI posted this elsewhere in the thread, but hey, maybe it won't get buried if I try again.

Lowcountry South Carolina checking in: the biggest risk we run with gators here is the idiotic tourists who come down and think they're cool to fuck around with. I've literally seen tourists on banks and docks casting fishing lines trying to hit the gator with their bait, to agitate it. And worse, I've seen (and stopped) tourists approaching a seven-footer to try and feed it *Chick-Fil-A nuggets.* 

The problem is, if it happens enough times, the alligator will get used to receiving food from people. And then they start to see people and think ""food!"" And then they start to approach people. And then they think, this person is holding out on me, being all coy backing away instead of giving me my chicken nuggets! And then they follow the person, who perceives it as aggression.

You can't relocate an alligator; they've fought other gators for the right to whatever territory they live in and they *will come back.* They will come back.

It *ruins* an alligator when they begin to feel comfortable associating with humans. I don't know of a single state that actually ""removes"" alligators--relocation doesn't work. Nine times out of ten, any pest control or park service you call will end up euthanizing any gator they've received a complaint about.

Here's a series of articles about a 50 year old gator who caused some ruckus in my town last June:

* First, someone saw him and complained. So he was removed.
* [Then he came back](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/03/3143848/whopper-gator-found-hilton-head.html) to his original location
* Someone complained that he was relocated rather than killed, so [an investigation started](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/04/3146663/large-alligators-release-to-be.html)
* A resident said that the gator [wasn't aggressive](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/07/3151999/hilton-head-islander-speaks-up.html)
* But the pest control guy lost his contract with the city anyway and the 50 year old, 1000 pound gator was killed.
* Some people [didn’t think the guy should’ve lost his job](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/09/3203948/petition-supporting-gator-wrangler.html)
* That's when things got really interesting. Another alligator was hit by a car on one of our busy highways in town. The city, having just terminated their contract with the-guy-who-handles-this-sort-of-thing, didn’t have anyone to go and pick it up. So, over the next few hours and in the ensuing traffic jam, all of our tourists and residents were treated to a delightful viewing of this alligator’s slow death in the median. [Article](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/03/3195631/maffo-critter-management-lose.html)


So, here are some tips for next time you see an alligator during your vacation:

* Respect them. Take photos from a respectable distance.
* Do not approach or harass them. They are not in a glass tank and they are not here to entertain you--you do not need to interact with them.
* Do not pick up, approach or harass their babies. Alligator moms actually do stick around their young and nurture them.
* Take care to look after your own young children and pets, as those are the most likely things an alligator will mistakenly see as food.
* Please don't call animal control just because you *see* a gator. Only call animal control if the animal is behaving in an aggressive way, or approaching humans. Gators who are minding their own business don't deserve to be euthanized just for existing.

AND RECOGNIZE, OF COURSE, THAT WITH RIGHTS COME CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES.My friends all signed a lease for an apartment together which had a clause in it stating ""no foam parties"" (For those who don't know it's where you lay down tarps and stuff and fill your apartment with soap suds and bubbles, obviously there can be some serious damage)

We mused on the idea of filling our apartment with foam, and then all sitting and studying in the waist high foam. So when the landlord came and said ""No foam parties!"" We'd all act really mad and say ""Excuse me does this look like a party? We all have exams tomorrow could you please leave?""
Fucking kids these days. When I was a kid I *knew* how to get in troubleI threw a Halloween party at my house in college once, 300some people showed up (we had a big house and a big fenced in yard)  It was wild, DJs, bouncers, girls dancing on the bar, 3 floors of madness.  It was awesome.

Well at about 2am the cops showed up in full force expecting to have to chase down tons of underage drinkers and drug users.  Thankfully we prepared.  When the cops showed up we had the 2 ""bouncers"" greet them and texted us that it was time to break up the time. 

I got on the DJ's mic and told everyone that the cops were here and wanted the party to end, but they didn't want trouble.  So I urged everyone to NOT run, as it creates a panicky atmosphere where cops and students are freaking out.  

All the students left, no arrest or citations, and even though I was underage, the cops left us with a verbal warning.  The head officer then came to me, shook my hand, and said great party and thanks for ending it so calmly.

We got to party like animals for 5 hours and it had 0 negative outcomes.


*TL'DR - cops like a good party as much as the next guy, and thanked us for ending it when they asked in a responsible manner*I love being Canadian.Why couldn't they just let them turn down their music? This is actually amazing.In high school my friends and I threw a graduation party with no alcohol. All the partiers were either in some music department or taking AP classes and headed to college next fall. 

We had the cops come into the backyard because of noise complaints/possible drinking/typical suburban problems. The first conversation they heard was about Cello and what it takes to play at a collegiate level between me and my friend. 

Literally the words the cops said to us were, ""oh we can see you kids are  having fun, try to keep it down your neighbors are worried."" 

That was a fun summer. memories. [Expectation](http://i.imgur.com/DyO8lrw.jpg)

She was so funny. I'll miss her. This picture makes me happy! I'm glad she has people that care for her. 

Edit: My highest rated comment by FAR.If you wanted I bet you could find someone to photoshop that bag off her knee - I dont mean to imply that it's bad, just if you wanted it gone I've seen some great photoshop jobs here on reddit. 

awesome picture tho, I hope she's currently as comfortable as possible. Good on you for doing this for your grandma OP, the smile on her face is proof how much she appreciates you doing this for her.

As a nurse I work with a lot of patients who are terminally ill and frequently I'll ask them what were the most memorable moments in their life. 9/10 times people will mention family or memorable moments like these. Never once have I had a patient mention money or personal possessions as the highlight of their life. It's the little things in life that matters, make them count.The most simple pleasures of life can mean a lot to some. Doctor here. This is the way it should be. Dying with dignity versus the medical torture we sometimes use to prolong the inevitable. Love the joy on her face. Congratulations to her for a long life. This is such a touching pic.  It brought both tears to my eyes as well as happiness seeing that smile on her face.  She looks like the Grandma everyone would want around them.  Sending big hugs to you and your gram.Wat.When my uncle came home from hospital to die (he didn't want to stay in the hospice, so his wife and my mother cared for him during his final 3 weeks. His bed was set up in the sitting room, his view out the window was onto the mountain range in our area. He woke up to the sun rising every morning over it. During the day and in the evenings his bed was wheeled out into the kitchen so he could be there with his family and be beside the stove. He could lie there and look out the double doors onto the bay. The view from the kitchen over the bay is unbelievable, many people at the funeral in the house were amazed at it. 
Before his remains left the house to go to the church we faced him towards the sea one last time. Something I believe would have put a smile on his face. Happy watFuck yeah grandson! Not only are you sharing that fantastic day with her, and making her final desires a reality, you are there. And her face shows the joy and wonder of the setting and experience with you! 

To this day I regret missing my stepfathers final days, due to work commitments and travel constraints. All in all bullshit rationalizations. I just missed his death by @ 6 hours. Regret not being there just to say goodbye, hold his hand and thank him for everything he was to me. So kudos, it's hard to watch it happen, but being there for our loved ones is soul work. It is our responsibility and great honor to help them pass from this world to...

Edit: For assumptions about OP's gender!Is this San Diego?

As someone who works in SD in some palliative/ home hospice care settings please listen to me when I say

You're all doing the right thing for her. HOSPICE DOES NOT MEAN YOURE GIVING UP ON SOMEONE.

Rather than use a still from the video like a lot of other news agencies are, deny IS their sadistic pleasure by not showing any image of their atrocity at all. Sadly, my first thought was ""Holy fuck, that's an expensive page of ink"".

But, as a designer myself, I realize it serves its purpose, so it's worth it.Quite the classy move. A picture of the gruesome act would probably sell more papers but they chose to pay their respects instead and report the facts. Glad to see this. From what I read about the poor guy he really did seem to have a big heart and compassion for people in that region and for the independent to print this on this front page conveys that sentiment. 1. I dont know the name of the killer.

2. Didnt even see a picture of him.

3. They didnt show the video.

This is everything they should avoid to do and they did. Instead i know who was killed and where my prayers should be going. I like this, other news magazines should write down some notes.i think this is getting more of a reaction...which is what the papers wanted anyway.The Indie has a grand history of great front pages.

Is that Leslie Knope?God I want to live in Vermont...No video yet? The hat lady said the University of Vermont is a private school and I don't think anyone corrected her.

Per Wikipedia: ""UVM, is a **public** research university and, after 1862, the U.S. state of Vermont's land-grant university. The University of Vermont is labeled **one of the original ""Public Ivies,""** a publicly funded university considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.""

Also: the secessionist guy on the end is wearing jean shorts.Sad thing is that the candidates who know they won't win often have great ideas. Knowing they won't get elected gives them the liberty to say what really needs to happen. Of course some really are just crazy. [deleted]I'd like to give the clean shaven gentlemen an opportunity to get their debating beards from backstage... Some of our best politicians wouldn't be elected today because voters somehow confuse looking like a respectable politician with actually being a respectable politician.make fun of it all you want, but we do just fine without the fake idiots who can barely pull off pretending to care about what the people want/need. somehow, even with all the crazies, we do pretty well. we're a pretty progressive place, have the first city powered entirely from renewable resources, and we're pretty decent as far as civil liberties go. i think most other state debates are much more of a joke, even though the people look more serious. Looks about right for a VT gubernatorial race.  From left to right:  Jerry Garcia in hiding, rich woman there to look at leaves, career politician, guy who moved to VT for gun rights, another career politician, housewife with no practical experience who thinks they need to get the ""Washington insiders"" out of Montpelier, and a car salesman.

http://www.smartshanghai.com/venue/11731/flaskIt's like good times at Davey Wayne's in Hollywood. How I know how people feel when they see the TARDIS in the shows. I once went to a crazy place kind of like this.  Story time!

I was in Toronto, at some club.  I wasnt really feeling the vibe, but did my best to enjoy myself.  Club Mamba or something like that.  Anyway, after last call, I figured I might as well make the best of the dancefloor as the DJ was getting ready to finish up.  Some random dude came up to me and asked me if I was going to the after party.

He gave me a card with an adress on the back.  He told me to knock twice on the side door and keep my head down.  Seemed kind of sketchy, but I was in a very open and trusting mood and wasnt ready for the party to end.

I grabbed my buddies and headed to grab a cab.  The cabbie looked at the adress and asked"" Are you sure?  Thats in the commercial district.  Nothing is open there.""  I told him to go to the address anyway.  

Once arriving, the scene did not look like any sort of venue, so I was confused.  The address was for a small two story Realtor's office. I paid the cabbie and asked him to wait, but he waved me off with kind of a told you so gesture.

Not to be made a fool by my friends, I was still optimistic.  ""Just wait, he said side door man, just wait.""

So I walk into the alley and low and behold there a side door.  I knock twice, honestly not expected anything but knocked anyway.  After a moment of waiting I had all but given up, but just as I turned to my freinds, the door open and a large man grumbled "" Ten dollars in your hand, keep you head down, dont say a word and pay the lady at the door.""

Uhhhh k.  So we head down and all three of us were speechless without the warning.  I was still pretty skeptical however, because I could hear no bass line.  As we get to the bottom of the stairs, a very old asian lady is sitting on a stool, complete with an old school accounting visor.  She says ""10 dollar"" and we quietly hand over our money as per direction.  Behind her, a man, im not shitting you, turns around and opens a freaking giant vault door.  Door cracks and the most insane electo-bassline leaps out.

I walk into the MOST insane, underground, speak-easy rave den.  Open drug use, bar serving well past first call.  Easily one of the coolest situations I found myself in at the time.  

I dont remember much after that unfortunatley, but I remember getting to work around 10am, completely unfazed by the lack of sleep.

The crash occurred a few minutes after takeoff with the plane ditching into Keelung River which flows through the city, an engine flameout was speculated to be the reason. Weather conditions were normal at the time. Since the river is not under normal flight path it seems that the pilot was trying to attempt an emergency landing and to avoid causing serious damage to the buildings. 

Rescuers said that the cabin was flooded to chest height and has a strong smell of gasoline. Many passengers were still in their seats with their seatbelt fastened and unable to escape. Most passengers that are unaccounted for are located at the front of the aircraft which is submerged under the river. Some are also feared to have been thrown out of the cabin when the plane crashed. It's rumoured that a few bodies have floated downstream.

There are 53 passengers including 2 infants and 5 crew members on board. 12 people are still missing while 31 deaths are confirmed and the black box has been found as of 2030 UTC. 31 of the passengers are Chinese. This route is quite popular with Chinese tour groups since there is a ferry service that connects Kinmen to Xiamen which is a low cost alternative for them to visit Taiwan rather than taking the direct flights.

This is the second crash of TransAsia Airways in the past 12 months with another ATR 72 crashing during approach under horrible weather conditions last July. The government has now ordered all 22 ATR 72 aircrafts operated by both TransAsia Airways and UNI Air to be grounded for further inspection. If the aircrafts are grounded for the next few weeks it might cause some serious trouble to people going home for Chinese New Year that is coming up very soon. 

Local newspaper has reported that the aircraft that crashed suffered engine problems during its delivery flight less than a year ago from France and was diverted to Macau to replace an engine. A third-party certification agency has recommended the airline to not the take the delivery of the plane but the suggestion was rejected. The unnamed pilot that was interviewed claims that there are problems with the certification process done by ATR.

All the luck in the world to the brave people of Hong Kong. For those who aren't aware of what's happening there right now:

[""Occupy Central With Peace and Love, as the protest is officially known, aims to foment democratic change by paralyzing the heart of this freewheeling financial hub. It was originally slated to begin Wednesday, but an aligned student demonstration Friday gathered such momentum that its leaders brought the launch forward.""](http://time.com/3439242/hong-kong-democracy-china-ocuppy-central/)I was born in Hong Kong and my family moved overseas when I was a child. For many years I have always hated hong kong: I hated the apathy, I hated the materialism, I hated the fact that all everyone talked about is money. I moved back there a few times and every time I would find an excuse to leave as that culture of no one caring about anything but themselves got too much for me to take.

I am now studying in the US and every time I see a photo like this, it brings tears to my eyes. The students proved the future of Hong Kong is not selfish, it is not apolitical, and it is willing to fight with each other for a better future. We do not want to break from China, we just want to protect our way of life that we can see disappearing bit by bit, year after year. We are sick of a puppet government bending to the will of China and tycoons, ignoring the plight of ordinary HK residents. I am even more proud knowing that most people there are aware of the potential consequences of the police, or even the army being sent to handle them, and that they will likely lose. But they are still there, occupying the streets, helping each other, staying peaceful, even cleaning the streets, for fuck's sake. I have never been as proud to be  HKer and never been sadder to be away. Now this is how you protest. Hats off to the protesters. Hong Kong is spotless. No looting, no damaged property. This is how to do a protest. The Hong Kong protest should not be compared with the Occupy movement.

The Hong Kong protest is about the people wanting Universal Suffrage - the right to vote through a real democratic process and not some state selected candidates which is achievable through electoral reform.

The Occupy movement is about a protest against social and economic inequality which happens not just in the US but also around the world. This is why the movement failed because this is highly unachievable goal.Taiwan here, wish HK the best of luck.I love seeing this.Whenever I see pictures like that, I get pee anxiety.  Man, what would I have to do if I had to go?  I'd never find a bathroom in time.Does anybody have tl;dr: of what is going on there?I'm surprised nobody brought a beach ball5000 protesters according to the authorities https://www.reddit.com/live/tnc30xhiiqom

live thread about thisImagine if Hong Kong was able to separate from China 100%. Too bad that would never be allowed to happen :CThis is not going to end well. I don't see China making any concessions. The CCP rules with an iron fist over many autonomous regions such as xinjiang, tibet, inner mongolia. If they were to give an inch, it would affect all those regions plus maybe Taiwan. Hong Kong has to deal with the fact that it is part of China now and the pseudo autonomy they have will disappear officially in 2047. hopefully by then, the CCP will be more open and democratic. I've been there. That is a crazy amount of people even for HK. I imagine this is Hong Kong on a day by day basisI wish them the best of luck, hope they get what they want Anyone know current participation estimates *not* from the police?They should use the US Constitution as a base but they should outlaw lobbists, campaign donations and to be a citizen your parents have to be citizens (starting the after the Constitution is implemented) so they don't have created citizenship.

TL;DR There is not much left to fight for in Canada. [China](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-29405747) are telling their people it is an illegal uprising by students. That a minority are forcing them to do it and they gave the authorities no choice but to reluctantly use tear gas. 
Where do people go to the bathroom in situations like this?What an ironic name. The American Occupy movement was not a ""pro-democracy"" movement. It's hard to say what it was about due to its complete lack of focus, but primarily it was an anti-economic disparity movement. In fact, by the end it had been completely coopted by pro-communist organizations.

This seems like a very specific, very focused protest with clear goals. Putting the ""occupy"" label on it just makes it seem like something about that label was lost in translation.I know this is a serious situation and I really respect those demonstrators for standing up for their rights.

But I can't help but feel an odd twinge of that odd ""I've been there"" feeling because I've spent countless hours playing Sleeping Dogs.

Edit:  Sorry for the late replies to questions.  I feel like I was just initiated into owning a vintage car -- a day after its first car show, it left me stranded 1.5hrs from home.  Lessons have been learned about distributor points gaps, ignition coils, and lack of spark.  But all is good, the car is back home safely in the garage.At that point, aren't you pretty much just building a new car from scratch?Can you label which is before and which is after?One of the more impressive things I've all week and that includes reposts.The pride and satisfaction that you get from building your dream car rather than buy it is something that few will understand.  Congratulations, OP.  That is a sweet car. Noice, how much money did you lay down?Previous owner of a restored '69 here. My advice for you : Start hunting down door glass from a '70 right now. Thank me later.

I lost two driver's windows due to that shitty design where the driver's window glass glues into the attaching bracket at the bottom of the pane instead of being held in place by some grommets like the '70 glass. When you shut it, it's got a non-zero chance of just shattering no matter how hard or soft you close your doors. The '70 glass doesn't have this problem. I lost two windows in about 2 years, then my '70 glass lasted until I sold the car. Get a set now for when this happens to you. You're welcome.

You also will have better sealing against the rain. The window seal on the 70 glass is on the quarter glass instead of the door glass. This would also be my dream car, however living in Northern Ireland sucks, I'd say import taxes etc would be steep. One day though... One day I'll restore or outright buy one.

> Ok. I think this post warrants a little backround info. Reindeer are not hunted, but while they roam freely for most of the year, they are owned like cattle. The antlers glow only in car headlights so it's not like wolves are scanning the forest with searchlights for flashy reindeer. In addition to danger they pose on the roads as they do not fear vehicles, the herders have an economic incentive to keep the stock alive. If you drive in Lapland you cannot avoid seeing these animals around roadsides in large flocks. They cause traffic jams just by chilling on the road as well. In the wilderness of Lapland there are few street lights and the nights are tremendously long. I mean polar night.

We once tried to get a Rolls Royce contract and spent over a year fabricating one ring of vanes for them. They reject it over and over until we had to withdraw. They are very particular.Ahh yes a classic rolls-royce cobra style weld. While we all know how much the great welders of our time make, it is amazing what a little patience and knowledge of walking the cup can produce.  Judging by the picture, and the lack of scratches, it appears the master artisan must have tig fingered his way to success.  How else could one explain the beauty of this elongated infinity weaving style wield? Bartelby fartle clomp, I have no idea what is going on here.Dad works for rolls royce aerospace. He loves spouting off about them, and some stuff is really interesting. There are multiple rungs of blades inside a rolls royce combustion engine. As someone previously mentioned the whole engine is tested and designed to contain the damage if one of these blades shears off and gets mangled through the engine. He also brought home a small (5inch?) blade once that is normally worth about £10K, but because it had a defect that no human eye could detect it was nearly worthless. He also told me these blades are grown, not machined, because the metal's crystal lattice can sometimes have defects or impurities in the structure. They literally grow liquid metal crystal blades because they have a purer, stronger structure. Amazing.

*-edit: The amount of people trying to claim they know what they're talking about in this thread is astounding. No, metallic crystal growing is not ""letting molten metal cool"" or any other spurious shit i've read. As a student of forensic chemistry even i don't consider myself an authority on it but we covered it briefly in electrochemistry. It's basically bringing the metal ions out of solution very slowly so it forms a uniform crystal structure. Here's a basic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnyBldC4Ra4) of the process, obviously the techniques they use are more refined than this so they grow less complex structures. But the fundamentals are there.*

**-edit: I'm gonna stay true to reddiquette and formally recant my last edit as opposed to just deleting it. I was informed, during our electrochemical stint, by a phD professor that this is how they grow crystalline metallic single crystal lattices for rolls royce blades. But as i aforementioned, i'm no authority on it**[This is what my welds look similar too](http://www.motorgeek.com/phpBB2/gallery2/d/79519-2/crap6.JPG) No wonder i cant get a job at Rolls Royce...

I did it as a summer job between uni terms and it was the best job ever. We used to just pile up a trailer with soil a couple of times a day, jump on the back and lie down (in the nice soft soil) until we got to the spot we were working at that day.

Then we'd work in the sun all day until home time, I loved it! Rainy days were a bit rubbish but its gona happen. Overall I would love to do it again.

The original axe currently resides in the Copenhagen National Museum in Denmark. The axe is dated to 970-971 AD, and is thought to have belonged to an individual of high status, likely a chieftain. Jan Petersen categorized axes used during the Viking Age based on the shape of their heads. He classified them into twelve varieties, Types A-M (there is no Type J). The axe head of the Mammen axe is best described as a Petersen Type G. Although the axe head is partially corroded and the haft is gone, the beauty and elegance of the axe are still easily visible.

I'M SICK OF THESE MOTHERFUCKIN' PLANES ON THESE MOTHERFUCKIN' TRAINS!There's actually a pretty interesting fact about these fuselages. The fuselage (the body of the plane without any guts, wings, tail or anything) is manufactured at a plant in Kansas, Wichita if I'm not mistaken, then taken to the Boeing plant in Everett/Renton, Washington by train, where the planes are completed and flown out of.

The size of these fuselages is limited to a specific length(somewhere around 76.5m), not because they can't build planes bigger, but because there is a tunnel in Kansas that the train which transports these fuselage travels through and if the fuselage were any bigger than the maximum size, the train would get stuck in that tunnel.

*edit: Almost went with the Rav4 for several reasons, not just the table. I have a coworker who was just trying to sell me his CRV.  His sales pitch?  ""It still has the fold out table!""my brother had a first-gen CR-V, and never had to change a tire for the first six years he had it. I was with him when he had his first flat, and when we took the trunk panel out to get the jack (spare was mounted on the back in this one), one of the legs came down because it was loose and we discovered the table.

Well the spare wasn't roadworthy either, so we sat in an empty parking lot, playing cards and drinking Mt. Dew on that table until AAA arrived.Oh I miss our CRV. This was so handy and simple. Pretty sturdy too, as foldable tables  go. For everyone as dumb as I am - [this is the INTERNAL spare tire cover (under the cargo area), not the EXTERNAL spare tire cover.](http://i.imgur.com/BQ0q0KA.jpg)I sold Hondas for about 6 months and one of our sales gimmicks on the CRV was to be like, ""Hey, check out the spare tire!"" and while they were like, ""Huh, spare tire."" We'd quickly set up the table behind them and be all like, ""Bam! Table!"" 

I think I sold 2 or 3 CRVs. I wouldn't fuck on that. Doesn't look stable to side-to-side motion.Holy crap!  I wonder when they started doing that.  I have a 2006 or 2007 that is in the shop right now (some asshole without insurance hit it).  I will have to check it, but I could swear mine is just a thin bit of wood with carpet on one side.-customer: ""What I really want is a vehicle tailored specifically for my needs""

Do you have anything like that?""Holy shit. There's a picnic table in my car too! I literally just walked out of work to go check because I didn't believe you, but there it was. I feel like they should tell you about these things when you buy the car.We almost bought a CRV years ago because of this feature.I had a '99 CR-V, and I remember the moment I got to the part in the manual (yeah, I read my car manuals) that mentioned it had a folding table. I was like, ""No way! No way!"" *pulls out folding table* ""OH MY GOD! THIS IS AWESOME!"". When I sold/gave the CR-V to my cousin, I made sure to point out it had a folding table several times.

Gives me chills whenever I think about what my friend and his mom must have gone through.Cop here. Most hair raising call I've ever been on was a call where a female called 911 without her boyfriend knowing. He had beaten the hell out of her. She called 911 but left her phone in her purse. My dispatchers could hear an altercation in the background and  used their magic to find the address. Several of us are responding to the area with the fancy lights and wee-woo's going. He heard the sirens from far out (we shut down as we get close) and assumes we are going somewhere close. Remember, he has no idea she called so he isn't expecting us to be coming to his house. As we are surrounding the house he says to his girlfriend ""I'm gonna go shoot at the cops."" Our dispatcher heard this and is relaying the information. About that time the female gets on the phone and tells us he just went out the back door with a gun. He had barely touched grass when 4 cops were drawn down on him. Thankfully he made a smart decision to drop his gun (yes, he did actually come out with a gun) and everyone went home that day. Just serves as a reminder how fast my job can go from mind numbingly boring to absolute terror.

Because that would be fucked up. Just because my coked- up husband with a knife is threatening to kill me and my two kids does NOT mean I don't want my fucking pepperoni pizza.

This happens in movies, not real life. Someone on the team has a dirty contact in the mining industry, or a brother, etc. The contact lets them into the worksite to steal an industrial boring machine that they carry to the bank wall in a stolen van that can barely hold the drill. They bore all night, shutting it down when the night guard comes around so he doesn't hear it. They get through with only 30 minutes before the bank opens and just get all the loot out when the auto lock on the vault door clicks open.

This was at a safety deposit building in Central London and the raid was done over the Easter long weekend. 
The hole is 18""x10"" and approx. 20"" deep. 

The criminals dressed as contruction workers and prior to starting had advised people in the area of ongoing construction so they wouldn't be concerned about the noise. They busted in (bringing the drill in in a wheelie bin) and then spent most of the long weekend in there drilling the holes and pillaging the boxes. The security guard apparently didn't investigate at any time and despite the police picking up an intruder alarm they coded the call in a way that they decided not to respond. (There was something about the way they respond to an alarm if there had previously been multiple false alarms...this lead to speculation that the theives intitially set off the false alarms in the hope that it would deter PD from actually responding when a genuine alarm went off).
 The thieves made out with approx. $300 million worth of goods from 70+ boxes and we know nothing else as to their whereabouts/who they are etc.

Sounds like a game of Payday to me.I work with these coring machines on a regular basis. They're very loud especially when you're dry coring through concrete, more so when the concrete has had time to cure. I don't understand people posting comments about having the machine catch when it tilts off axis, the first thing you do when setting up for a hole is level the drill and bolt it to the floor/wall. Some of the newer drills have a suction pump and gaskets to mount to places you can't anchor to. 

I can drill 30 inches of concrete with rebar in it with a new bit in under 15 minutes but it's still ungodly loud.

They basically said ""vaccines don't cause autism and here's why.  But here's why these people think they do and it's because of flaws we all possess.""

[Link here](http://youtu.be/Rzxr9FeZf1g) for interested.Hopefully our war on science will be just as effective as our war on drugs, terror and poverty.  In other words, after ten years, science will be stronger than ever before.Over 90% of people who have had vaccinations don't have autism = vaccinations must cure autism. Whats up with USA and it's war with everything. You guys should have war on war.A few months ago I was at a party and the topic of vaccinations came up (no idea how) and one woman in her thirties was adamant that vaccinations were terrible. Her explanation was ""money is the root of all evil. Vaccinations cost money."" 

So I asked if she'd ever had antibiotics and she said yes, plenty of times. She didn't see the problem. I've never understood how a person benefits from rejecting the Moon landing. I understand why people reject climate change (greed) or GM food (fear) but what is it about landing a man on the Moon that threatens a person?My nephew told me about this issue of NatGeo by saying: ""Did you know they are saying the Moon landing was fake?""

I was about to go into my short speech about the hoaxers, then he showed me the cover and I had to pause and fit together a new response. Basically, I just told him to read the article.

Point is, some people will look at this and say ""yeah! war on science! stupid scientists! about time we ended that war on Christmas and started fighting the true demons of this world. Greedy, lying scientists!""I read this article and it was great - but it struck me as a little pandering to their audience (kind of like OP is to us). Of course NatGeo readers are going to agree with the sentiment.I just wish they also had ""Homeopathy is working"" on there.Just a comment on the Moon Landing...

I always like to ask the person that is convinced the moon landing was fake... ""Which landing was fake?"". Nine times out of ten they had no idea Americas landed on the moon 6 times... lolThe most surprising/sad thing on the cover? ""March 2015""... It seems like we shouldn't be debating science when the cover displays a man on the moon from almost 50 years prior. [deleted][deleted]I did a masters in environmental policy and we spent a surprisingly large amount of time criticizing people on the left for their lack of scientific rigor.  It's amazing how quickly these arguments turn into emotional pleas instead of rational analysis. It's funny. When I learned about European history as a kid, I thought it was really, really dumb that people were so devout that they completely rejected science just because it threatened their religious beliefs.  I thought, man were people backwards back then!  They could've prevented so many problems and lived much better lives if they weren't like that!  Good thing I'm living in an era where people are much wiser!

Sadly, now that I'm older, I've begun to realize that although centuries and centuries have passed, not much has changed.  Our society constantly falls back towards certain ways of thinking and still fights science and progress at every turn.  We reap the benefits of modern technology and medicine, but have so little appreciation for it.  It's truly disappointing.How about something like ""The Wars on Wars."" 

Why the fuck does EVERYTHING have to be a war on *something* these days?

The war on women

The war on drugs

The war on Terror

The war on Science

The war on Gamers

The war on Men


Fuck all if someone, somewhere isn't winning and then blames it all on someone who believes the exact opposite of what you believe in. There's no more civil discourse anymore. One side always feels the *other* side is suddenly at war because they disagree. This shit is starting to seriously wear on me.

And another thing - stay the fuck off my lawn!

Also, good job lady photog.Balloon pilots have a move they call splash and dash.  When flying over water, they bring the balloon down and touch the surface with the basket and then lift off again.  I've only been on one balloon ride and the pilot pulled this off.  It was pretty spiffy.  The thing I appreciate most about hot air balloons is that, despite all the advances in composites and the high tech materials we now have, they haven't really changed in 100 years.

I strapped in for what I thought was going to be a rough night after the show ended and I had 200+ rooms of fans amped from the show. 

It was one of the best nights I had working. Every single fan was polite, courteous to the other guests, and just happy they saw their favorite band play. It must have been the only night I didn't get a noise complaint.

> The history of the figure is rather incredible. It was found in 1887 in a peat bog near Slupsk. When the figure was examined it turned out to be the amulet of a bear hunter, originating from the Neolithic period. It was dated at between 1700 B.C. and 650 B.C. Since the researchers were not precise regarding the age of the find, we can assume this figure is over three thousand years old. The original did not stay long in Slupsk since special protection was sought for the oldest item ever discovered in the Pomerania. The museum in Szczecin guaranteed safety, and the amber bear was placed there - probably until 1945. However, the people of Slupsk found it difficult to cope with the loss of the amulet of happiness - in 1924 the guild of amber makers decided to make a copy. Arthur Fischer was the author of the faithfully reproduced new bear of happiness, and the figure became the pride of the amber collection presented in the City Museum in Nowa Brama. The figure delighted the eyes of the inhabitants of Slupsk until March 1945 - when it was stolen, along with all amber and gold jewellery. Thanks to an unknown stroke of fate, the copy encountered the original, after many years, in the Historic Museum in Stralsund. In the summer of 2002, the German press announced that the copy of the bear was presented to public, whereas the original amulet did not leave the museum's safe. It is a secret how the museum became the owner of these two figures. However one should be happy that both of them survived. The copy of the famous bear appeared again in the history of Slupsk. Thanks to the president, Maciej Kobylinski, the amber bear attracts tourists tothe town hall, where it is exhibited in a special show case. Once a year, the tiny figure is put on auction, and the funds raised are dedicated to charity. The figure is replaced by a new copy in the show case. The first beneficiaries of the bear were the single mothers of three severely sick children. Thanks to the generosity of entrepreneurs from Slupsk, who participated in the auction, the little figure brought lots of joy to the homes of the sick children. This winning bear was also given by the inhabitants of Slupsk to the president of the Republic of Poland - Aleksander Kwasniewski. The amber figure arouses sympathy, and therefore its association with Slupsk is enjoyable. Let it always bring well-being to our underprivileged city. 3500 year old gummy bear! I mean who doesn't eat the legs first? If there's a mosquito stuck in there I bet we could use its DNA to finally recreate bears.

Description
*the mighty bear amulet passed down through the generations of the great bear fighter tribe of the great River, this was forged by the legendary bear slayer Smasher Basher! Blessed with the power of strength this amulet will give you the power of the BEAR!*TIL the arms and legs on bears are a relatively new thing.Things like this really make me feel connected to the someone in the past. It's so easy to be detached from our ancient ancestors. There are very few things that connect us to them in a tangible way. But this...this does it for me. A person made this with his own hands. They may have made it as a good luck charm for hunting. Or perhaps it was a gift for a new spouse. Maybe it was just something to bring him/her joy in a world that always seemed to be little more than a struggle for survival. Hell, maybe it was even a trinket for a spoiled princess or little more than a tiny figurine for a child to play with. It doesn't really matter. 

Someone made this with their hands. For this person the sky was still something untouchable, and the stars were gods. There were no seconds, hours or months - only seasons. Nature was still something to be feared and in awe of, not mostly ignored like it is today. My existence is completely different than his/hers in almost every conceivable way. But this object brings us close together. It's simple and features a shape I can recognize and appreciate. Even if it doesn't look like an actual bear it resembles it enough for me to understand it. It's human in that way. 

I'm not sure any of this makes much sense. I'm struggling to articulate why an object like this moves me. It's [Glottis!](http://gerezon.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/glottis.jpg)[Info](http://www.slupcio.slupsk.edu.pl/english.php).

For one, cropping isn't something you can *really* control on a camera, at least not in terms of aspect ratio. But aside from that, the *idea* behind a photo is much more important (to me anyway) than the initial capture.

Don't get me wrong, actually being able to capture exactly what you want in the original capture is incredible, but editing is arguably just as important, especially in an age where it's almost expected. What editing does is allow the actual concept and creativity to shine. And that comes **well** before the, for lack of a better term, ""lucky shot"". A truly perfect shot that is unedited is almost always due to at least *some* amount of luck. After all, some thing you just can **not** plan, and those things shouldn't be rewarded in any way other than intrigue (or admiration of dedication, in the cases where someone was committed to a specific thing until they got the perfect shot they were looking for).

I of course recognize that there are photos which can be planned (to a certain degree at least), and that planning will have an incredible effect when done right. But what I guess I'm trying to say is that a photograph's ""value"" shouldn't depreciate due to it being altered (in cases where the alteration is purposeful and warranted of course-- if you make a picture ""worse"" by making terrible edits then that should obviously depreciate it). Photos that are altered (heavily, lightly, or anywhere in between), while obviously having different connotations, should all be treated with the same legitimacy in my opinion. Otherwise it's like telling someone ""your piece would be awesome, if it wasn't for the fact that you used a medium that's generally easier to work with"". Success through difficulty increases value, but difficulty is far from the only aspect that matters most.Congrats on getting that shot. You were in the right place at the right time, and you definitely did not fuck it up.

mother rabbits often leave their babies for hours at a time because mothers are more easily spotted by predators. Many baby rabbits appear ""abandoned"" while the mother is actually hiding nearby. If you find baby rabbits that appear motherless and in need of care, it's far more likely she's watching from a nearby bush and hoping you won't touch her babies anymore.

Same goes for young deer. Mothers often leave them alone while they go forage. A fawn leaves no scent, almost no tracks, and are virtually silent, they're much safer without a six foot tall, smelly mom hanging over their shoulder all the time.

tl:dr - Leave baby rabbits alone. They're fine.

Edit: fawn is the baby deer, not a doe.Nah, he's old enough to be hopping around, though looks like he was either looking to nurse for the evening or really couldn't find his mother. Mothers leave the kits alone except to feed them once a day, the kits are scentless and will not attract predators. They are very good at meeting up with their mother when she starts looking for them to nurse. ALWAYS leave baby rabbits alone when you see them, unless they're in harm's way or thin. This guy looks thin-bellied, indicating he hasn't been fed for the day yet. On the bright side if your buddy did take him to a wildlife center, the kit could survive with syringe feeding. Rabbits younger than three days old won't make it with supplemental feeding alone. They all usually die the third day.Actually rabbits can survive  on their own at like 3 weeks so he could just be a young,  independent bunny who don't need no man.He's so teeny!That rabbit is not abandoned, it's large enough to leave the nest and be on its own, rabbits are not like human infants. If you see a rabbit nest with no adult rabbit around, leave it alone. The mother rabbit will typically only visit the nest a couple times a day to feed the infants, she spends the rest of the time away from the nest so that predators don't find her at the nest.My dog brought me two of them last summer...

Very interesting photo. Not least because of the painting the woman is 
looking at. That is a self-portrait of Rembrandt in old age. Rembrandt painted dozens of self-portraits throughout his life (partly because he couldn't afford models) and he is very severe and unforgiving as he records the aging process. We see in his face the life he lived, the joys and the disappointments. It is a very instructive choice for the viewer, who will see different nuances and meanings as they themselves age and their strength declines. I can understand why this person wanted to see this painting as she nears the end of her journey. It is clear she lived her life thoughtfully. May her loved ones take comfort in the memories.
the rijksmuseum and the scheepvaartmuseum are worth a week of your life. Do it.I completely respect that. I want to die with my favorite songs in my ears.I visited the Rijksmuseum in my early 20s.   Needless to say the trip is a bit of a blur, but I remember being blown away by the how much more realistic Rembrandt's works were compared to his contemporaries.   But I digress...I'm glad the woman in this picture was able to enjoy the beautiful pieces one last time.This is really beautiful.

My favorite painting is [The Night's Watch.](http://www.led-professional.com/project_news/art-museum-lighting/philips-sheds-new-light-on-night-watch-at-the-rijksmuseum/the-new-led-lights-protects-environment-and-art/image_richdoc_big)[deleted]That particular Rembrandt self portrait used to be at the Kenwood House in Hampstead, London. I know because I've visited it twice. I wonder when it was moved (back?) to Rijks. I didn't see it this past January when I was in Amsterdam. I wasn't aware this organization existed. That's REALLY cool. Looks like we've got it in Belgium as well. It's oriented specifically towards non-mobile palliative care patients and, unlike Make-a-Wish, it's not age-specific.

Thanks for sharing, OP :)

edit: Thought I would edit in the event that anyone would like to donate to the [Belgian](http://www.ambulancewens.be/steunen/) or [Dutch](http://www.ambulancewens.nl/doneren/) versions of the organization.Wow this is awesome. My mother and I take care of my grandmother and she doesn't have much time left and she has always wanted to live in Florida.so we packed up the house and moved down there. We actually just got a house yesterday!Lots of people who enter the museum don't have the opportunity to leave, because a different person exits.That's a beautiful picture. Not so much the picture itself, but what it represents. It seems so peaceful.This is touching. I was able to visit the rijksmjeseum and van Gogh museum two years ago. I think it changed how I look at art.Wow, what a stunning photo.  The story is told all in that image.  Who was this person, what did she value, where is she, what is her condition, to what did she aspire... Great photo.
That's really good they were able to do that for her, and it's beautiful that at the end of her days she wants to be around timeless beauty.

*obligatory edit*: first gilded comment, someone catch me if I swoon.Almost looks like one of those log ridesThis seems like an engineering issue.Photo credit: Dan Slack - Folsom, CAI work for the mechanical department of Union Pacific and this level of water is usually not a problem. Like someone else mentioned in the comments only the flange of the wheels will actually be in contact with the water.
Its only an issue when there is 3+ inches of water of submersion of the rails. Reason being is that the water splashes into the electrical motors that run the wheels and causes them to short out. (Locomotives are diesel series hybrids, i.e diesel engine powers a generator which in turn powers electrical motors located at the wheels.)

Other issues with flash floods is sometimes the foundation of the rails gets shifted causing massive derails on our systems, we usually tell our trains to slow down over rails submerged like this.FUN FACT!

Back when high speed steam powered express trains were a thing they had track pans that went in between the rails.  Since water was the type of fuel that was mostly used and that ran out first, they would be making several stops to refill on water.  Their solution was a chute at the bottom of the tender that would blow gallons into the tender from going across a track pan.  Express train ranges and speeds were greatly increased thanks to this cool little invention.  [Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/LNWR_Ramsbottom_Water_Troughs_1904_edited-2.jpg) is a picture of track pans being put into use on the LNWR (London & Northwestern) a british railway.  Sorry if I bothered people, the picture just reminded me of this.[Only to a point and then they fail.](http://imgur.com/a/iKXFK)

Hurricane Irene caused the Ramapo River to overflow leading to the failure of the commuter tracks in Sloatsburg, NY.

My god...I want an inner-tube and would so run that (probably wearing a dry suit too...looks cold). Just need a quick cold snap to freeze it over now.

Hello choo choo skates!I went from a genuine interest in the beauty of the non natural river and it's juxtaposition to the rivers embracing it, to wanting to tube behind a train.

He was kind of proud of and kind of disappointed in me at the same time. 



There's really no evidence he ever came back. That's a picture I'd like to see though.By induction, the previous graffiti was removed by a pair of sadomasochistic rabbits.

Edit: Thanks /u/pimp-bangin Now we need to have a photo of him in the same pose over his graffitti before it is removed. And when he removes it, we paint it back, this time with two. And rinse and repeat. Forever.He has that ""I don't get paid enough for this shit"" look...

He's right.this is the ultimate troll, i love it.From the Daily Mail, so take it for what it's worth, but [here's an article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2380703/DS-stencil-artist-Worker-sent-remove-graffiti-finds-image-sprayed-wall-hours-later.html) about the incident.I watched a Doc about these guys on netflix that go around and grey out graffiti called Vigilante Vigilante. It was really interesting how they become just as obsessed with their anti-graffiti as the graff writers are of ""getting up""Don't paint on another man's property. I'd be fed up too if some douche nozzle sprayed on my wall. Honestly it's kind of funny but from his perspective he's probably pissed. Respecting others property should be a given, especially since he's already shown that he wants it clean. Whoever did this is a jackass. Sometimes I think I'm the only person on Reddit who hates graffiti. I feel for this dude.

If it all looked like this in this picture, then I'd be more for it. But, 0.001% looks like this, and 99.999% looks like sloppy shit that makes your neighborhood look run down.Not to be a dick but that isn't him coming back to find an image of himself.  That is an image that was taken while he was there to remove other graffiti, then painted on the wall.He looks sad. I feel bad for this guyThat's some good graffiti. graffiti is the equivalent of taking a shit on someone elses lawn.

if you want to draw hello kitty so much, do it on your own walls.I hope that when he goes to clean this off, someone takes another picture and then graffiti that, then repeat in some sort of graffiti inception. i dont think he came back to discover it. Looks like someone just took a picture of itThis is back on the front page? I've officially been on Reddit too long.Honestly I'd be honored. He's been immortalized.I guess the real question becomes... ""who took that picture?""At least this graffiti is actually fun to look at. People around here don't even try. It's literally just some idiot with a spray can quickly spaying their initials or some generic ""You are not free.""  It's not even good handwriting or balanced on the wall or even straight. It literally looks like someone gave a kid a crayon and they drew their names on the wall. Half the time it looks like the paint stopped flowing and they just gave up.Aw man, he removed decent graffiti. If only it were those shitty bubble letters no one can read and just want removed.Seriously? Everyone thinks this is so funny and are applauding it? Look at the look on his face. Either this is his own private property, or it's his job to remove the graffiti.

[EDIT]

I just thought about my ex-girlfriend.What's amazing about evolution is that it's a blind force, the moths genes don't know what a wasp looks like nor was there ever a conscious effort to look like a wasp. It just so happens that the moths which looked a little more like wasps were more successful...so amazing that a blind force can create visual matches How do you know it isn't Hornet Moth Hornet?

An evil hornet which happens to do an excellent job of looking like a hornet moth.Hey, that's a pretty damn cool adaptation, I would never have known it wasn't a hornet!

However, if I were to see one, it would be treated as a hornet. Sprayed with the closest aerosol can until it fell to the ground, and then ground up into little crunchy chunks =D. (I do not like fucking bees.)Didn't know they were fuzzy!This would have been an excellent evolutionary trait until humans came around and fucked it up.Little guy should be a spokesperson for Racial Profiling.Does it fly like a moth though? I can easily tell a moths wildly erratic flight paths vs. a hornet. Also, moths don't tend to buzz like bees. I'm curious to know how the two differ in flying techniques.My family and I were in the hot springs at Radium, BC a few months ago. There's a small island in the centre of the pool. My dad and I were sitting beside it, when I saw this thing on the island. It's big, black, and yellow. Jesus Christ. It's the Megawasp. He's come for our souls. None would stand in his way as he caused a full 30 seconds of sheer terror.

But there was one. A brave soul, destined to save the hot springs from the Megawasp Overlord. He remains unnamed, but his deeds are not forgotten. The Hero gathered his courage, and lifted the Megawasp out of the water *with his bare goddamn hands*.

Many would have destroyed the Megawasp there and then. But the Hero was too noble for such brute violence. He deposited the deposed insect on the border of the pool, wet but alive. The Overlord, humbled, flew away, never to be seen again.

At the time, none of us knew the truth about the Wasp Tyrant: he was no more than a harmless moth. Nevertheless, the Hero is galvanized in my mind as a true savior.

How much that is relevant today I don't know, and there are other people that can answer that better than me, but either way you can't say that there isn't representing a little bit of the Islamic culture that still persists in the nation today.Albania.

You border on the Adri-atic.Nicely done, Sir.Albanians are amazing people. Despite the country being torn by all sorts of misfortunes, they have some really unique traits. They are the only officially atheist state in the world, and yet they handle religion in the literally, most respectful and peaceful manner in the wold. 


Catholic, muslim, atheist and orthodox Albanians co exist in perfect harmony. I know of many of them who go to church on Christmas and then to the mosque on Ramadan.

There was this young guy, spoke English fairly well, that offered to drive me to siem riep, but I declined. He started following me, which freaked me out as it was getting late, after spending 3+ hours at the border, but I decided to take him up on his offer to drive to siem riep. 

On the ride, he told me about life growing up on the farm, how he borrows his friends car, whenever he's not using it to drive passengers to the border. He learned English from some monks that would visit his farm every now and then. After almost reaching SR, the car breaks down, and he calls some friends who come with another car and a rope. The journey was about 3 hours with the breakdown but he was always in a good mood, definitely made the effort to keep our spirits up, and overall nice guy. Total cost of the ride was 20usd, which is nothing to us, but is a weeks salary for most them.

During the rectification of the Vuldrini, OP decorated his house  as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new house decoration for OP: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! What did you do Ray?Are you a god?What did you do, /u/ColoradoMovieCars, *what did you DO?*Former *Ghostbusters* (1984) crew member here. It's funny you used an inflatable because the actual Stay-Puft Man that you see in the movie is an inflatable prop, which was a last-minute replacement. It was originally supposed to be Anthony Daniels in a rubber suit walking around a miniature NYC, and to do the test shoots I had modified this cheap inflatable rubber prop from an old Michelin Man. Basically we heated it up, smoothed out the bumps, stuck a sea cap on it and then blew it up and draw a cartoony face with a sharpie.

The day we were to shoot the actual scene with Tony Daniels in the costume, Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd dropped by and watched us do the test scenes using the rubber prop on the miniature city. The way that it kind of bumped around as we tried to guide it through the motions using strings looked so comically surreal that they decided to shoot the actual scene in the movie using a full scale version of my inflatable. We re-purposed an old Michelin Man float from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and it took the entire art department two weeks to make the giant float look like my 7-ft model and we had to run cables from the roofs several nearby buildings to control the motion (the filming permits in Manhattan were a nightmare) but in a way I guess you could say that the iconic appearance of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was my brainchild. Kinda neat when you think about it.

By the way, Anthony Daniels was a total pro about it, these things just happen on set sometimes and you can't take it personally. He actually later thanked me because a vision of Gozer the Gozerian came to him in a vision that night and told him he would have been trapped and died of heat stroke if he had entered the costume.

I wouldn't walk down there... seems a little shady...We need streets like these in the US! Our roadways are so eff'ing ugly ...It's so odd to think this little street has been like this, in another part of the world, while we've been completely oblivious to it until now. Even now, whether it's night or day when you read this, the vines are firmly rooted in those walls and the canopy rustles in the wind. 

Then imagine how many other places there must be around the world like this, both in urban areas and in deep wilderness. Beautiful spots like this, that we never see, but still exist as wholly as we do. Just imagining what beautiful misè-en-scenes of the world that are out there right now is as good as actually seeing them, in my opinion. It's like the tree falling in the woods with no-one around; maybe there are some places which have never been seen by human eyes, and yet their existence is no less beautiful.Very cool.

Gates Foundation helped fund amazing work using endosymbiotic bacteria of the vector of dengue fever, Aedes aegypti. Basically, the bacteria used, (Wolbachia) effectively block dengue virus transmission inside the mosquitos. Thereby stopping mosquitos infecting humans with dengue. There is some neat biology which enables the Wolbachia to infect all the mosquitos in a given population (within limits).

Will potentially to stop millions of cases of dengue each year. If you read this Bill, thanks so much for funding this work. Fantatic science with fantastic outcomes.

Billions of dollars have been spent to cure more familiar diseases like HIV and AIDS, but frankly it's hard for me personally to understand the impact of the research because I, or people around me, have never experienced those diseases (God forbid!). The fact that you were in Indonesia to contribute to the fight against Dengue Fever is very emotionally moving - success of this research would undoubtedly impact me, the people around me, and future generations of Indonesians! Again, thank you so much! You are such an awesome member of society.When can we install ""photonic fences"" around the world and zap mosquitos to death? Can we have one in hat form?

...I imagine this tall pixie in the giant's castle on top of the beanstalk swinging an overgrown daffodil flower, trying valiantly to bash in the heads of the enemy and prevent them from overtaking Jack. Sadly, the pixie is slain in battle as the giant, 10 times taller than her, steps on her while running towards Jack. Her lifeless body, partially stuck on his sandal, oozes its innards onto the ground. There's hope though, for pixies are asexual, the juices from her body will fertilize the soil and bring about a group of flowers and trees that will eventually end up growing another pixie, which will be picked and boiled, for that is what the giant eats.Pretty cool?

Most people would give me a bottle of wine or similar for saving their car.  I always took a ""before and after"" photo so they could see how wet it would have got.

Then someone was super rude and threatened me because she thought I stole her car, so I stopped doing it.

Probably $3M of cars I've watched float away since then...   It's bad, but if I accidentally put a $500 scratch on the car while rescuing it, I'm liable.  If I let the whole $50k car be wrecked, I'm not liable.

Money talks.


EDIT:  For context, it's a ~200 car car park on the beach.  There is a clear sign at the entrance saying the time you must leave by before the water arrives.   Some city people don't understand the sign and assume it just means they get a fine for staying too late.   Then theres also a few who get their keys wet while swimming and the car won't go without it, then the surfing waves come and wash the car away.I wonder how long it took to get that far down?Used to live at Daytona beach, seen this happen way too many times and once a idiot in a mobile home had his stuck after the tide came in and took awhile to get that out I live in Washington state and it is legal and common practice to drive on the beach. If you follow the designated drive and parking areas you'll be fine. 

There's a guy who has a towing business at a nearby beach that pulls people out and puts it on YouTube. It's actually kind of funny and usually makes fun of people for it. Here's one of him pulling out a Jeep: https://youtu.be/0LufILfiEqYAh that reminds me of the time we forgot our tractor on the beach whilst it was low tide. Had to wait 8 hours to retrieve it, but it was still operational. I have a sinking feeling about this. ~ George Takei in 2 weeks when he reposts this. You could in a [Hilux](https://youtu.be/xnWKz7Cthkk?t=1m38s)dumb fucks watch too many commercials..

WOO PARK ON THE BEACH!  DRINK LITE BEER!  DANCE ALL NIGHT WITH HOT CHICKS...

oh wait...You don't have to drive it back to Germany to get the oil changed, but you can try!YOu can drive on the beach In Pismo CA. 

To get to the dunes you would have to drive across a river. People would sit there at high tide and wait for cars to get stuck. 
They would tell the $100 or it goes into the sea. 

The state decided to stop this predatory act so now they have a dedicated tow company. 

They charge $300 just to show up and pull you out for. This is just if you get stuck in the sand and need to be pulled 5 ft. 
It costs much more if you really get stuck in the water. 

The towing company pays the sate about $15k a year for the contract plus 4% of the towing and all storage fees. source

It's a 4matic too.. probably did fine on the sand until they got that close to the water. RIP little diesel benz.Am I the only TIL in here?

Locals will get too drunk or high and then park their car a *little* too close to the water and have to have it towed professionally, very quickly.  
A dumbass friend of mine once tried to take his geotracker over the part of the beach that the tide is normally covering, when the tide was on the way in mind you, and he slammed the brakes so he wouldn't hit a hole. His light ass car sank quicker than a murder weapon in the Hudson River. Successfully avoided ridicule by taking the license plates off.

>Captain Kevin Oprey stands beneath the soaring hull of Cunard's flagship Queen Mary 2, the largest and most expensive Ocean Liner ever built, a mile off the coast of Bali on Sunday during the ship's Round World Voyage in its 10th anniversary year.  

> Captain Oprey surveys the scene from the top of Queen Mary 2's bulbous bow, an underwater projection that minimises the creation of bow waves around the waterline when the ship is under way.  
Two safety craft were standing by during the photo-shoot, but Captain Oprey remained sure-footed throughout.  

> Queen Mary 2 will make her 10th call at Sydney on Friday 14 March 2014 after circumnavigating Australia, and then heads north towards Shanghai, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok and Singapore before turning west for Sri Lanka and Dubai, entering the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal and returning to the UK in time to mark the 10th anniversary of becoming Cunard's flagship, with sister ships Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria joining in the celebrations in Southampton on 9 May 2014.  

>In her first 10 years of operation, following a spectacular naming by Her Majesty The Queen on 8 January 2004, Queen Mary 2 has undertaken more than 420 voyages including over 200 Transatlantic Crossings and called at 182 ports in 60 countries.  

>At 151,200 tons, Queen Mary 2 accommodates 2,620 passengers and 1,253 crew.  
She remains the longest, tallest, widest ocean liner ever built as well as being the most famous and fastest passenger ship in operation today.

""A University of Michigan fraternity has apologized after officials at a ski resort say its members caused thousands of dollars in vandalism.

""Treetops Resort manager Barry Owens said the students were escorted from the premises by Michigan State Police last weekend after causing $50,000 in damage. The resort is in Dover Township near Gaylord.

""Owens said Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity members caused significant damage to furniture, carpet, walls and ceilings.""Pretty good. Here in the UK, I believe it was Manchester University, were in a pretty cheap ski resort. The rooms were too small to host a party and the walls were extremely thin. They put two and two together and knocked down the walls for 4 connecting rooms. Student logic.Dammit where's the fucking risk manager when we need him!?For anyone who hasn't seen the other damage yet, or is trying to call into doubt that this happened -- http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/01/21/university-michigan-fraternity-members-accused-resort-vandalism/22116999/

Some of our members just *needed* to destroy things.   I never understood that mentality.  It was an unwritten rule that you didn't bring anything of value into the fraternity house;  it would be demolished in a drunken fury within the week.  Or stolen.  

It was like living in a fucking house full of testosterone-addled chimpanzees with cell phones.I didn't realize Michigan was now accepting tornadoes as students. ITT: we find out that most of Reddit is private contractors who could fix up the place for under $1k> Sigma Alpha Mu President Joshua Kaplan emailed a written apology.

[source](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/01/21/university-michigan-fraternity-members-accused-resort-vandalism/22116999/)I worked at a resort where a man ran a bath for himself while drunk.  On the 4th floor then passed out in his room.  The flooded hotel was discovered by a guest on the 1st floor.  

We ran up, floor after floor opening rooms trying to find the source of the water til we made it to the 4th.  After banging on the door, we opened it to find a naked man just inside the door, passed out on the floor, and the bathroom tub running full blast and water everywhere.

He was there on his companies dime ($74,000 in damage and lost revenue).  It didn't end well for him.

edit: evidently people dont understand what overflow's on tubs, and the plumbing behind it is designed for.  look it up people.  it's not designed for tubs on full blast for hours, its designed to help you save your ass because you lost a second or two while filling, and or someone is splashing around in a full tub...ffs.  and the insults?  really?

[Here is the Supermoon shot](http://i.imgur.com/eHXgKf7.jpg) that I took last year.Finally my username is relevant! Just saying if it's not obvious, the Moon is never that big on the sky, ever. If this picture hasn't been photo shopped, then the photographer was very far away from the temple and took the picture  with a *big ass scope* that can zoom very far. Cool pic though.Ngl, read that as sailor moon at first. Was very confused. Fun fact; on a regular night the moon still looks bigger to us when close to the horizon, because when it's high up in the sky our brains don't have landmarks to reference its size.If I fits, I sits. Great wallpaperOh merciful Poseidon, have pity on this mechanical mariner.I guess Poseidon didn't want to be outdone by Jesus. What a shit hole! It doesn't even have a roof.PSA to everyone saying it's photoshop:

* The angle of this image suggests it was taken from [the other side of the sounio bay](http://www.mykonosblu.com/assets/media/PICTURES/userfiles/images/images/CAPE%20SOUNIO/BEACH.jpg), *northwest* of the temple. The supermoon rose in the *southeast* in greece.

* The pillars are 6 meters tall, and the distance across the bay to the temple is 1.2 km. If taken at this distance, the pillars would take up an angle of about 18 arc minutes. The supermoon was 36 arc minutes across. Tell me, do the pillars seem to be about half the size of the moon? (they do)

* Someone said you'd have to overexpose the moon to get the temple this bright at night. This wasn't taken at night - since a full moon is always opposite the sun in the sky, the sun had just set, probably just minutes earlier. So, it was still light enough outside to properly expose the temple AND the moon. 

TL;DR: If it's fake, someone should have a medal. That's a great shot! I visited Cape Sounion and the Temple of Poseidon a few months ago. That whole location is so ideal since it is far from the city.PLAY YOUR OCARINA!!!Looks like something straight out of the Ocarina of Time.","{'Sadness': 0.135724, 'Anger': 0.649564, 'Analytical': 0.003, 'Emotional_Range': 0.623, 'Tentative': 0.368, 'Joy': 0.071637, 'Disgust': 0.045824, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.383, 'Fear': 0.682482, 'Openness': 0.395, 'Extraversion': 0.444, 'Agreeableness': 0.424}"

Starring Emma Watson in the lead role maybe..This her explaining how the software was smart enough to recognize there was an error causing a lot of CPU load during the lunar descent and saved the mission by choosing to work on more important tasks and ignore these errors.  Kind of amazing that this code reacted more intelligently to failure than most modern systems:

Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful [M]oon landing it was.""

One accidental nudge and she'd have a whole new perspective on a stack overflow./r/gentlemanboners That's a lot of code.  Even in assembler or Fortran (really the two most likely possibilities), that's still a lot of code.  I presume she's NOT the only programmer.

I'm gonna do a wild estimate.  I'm gonna say she's 5'8"" / 175 cm, and that stack is exactly as high.  I happen to have a thing of 500 sheets of paper here which coincidentally is exactly 5cm thick.   Meaning that could be 17,500 pages.  I doubt it's that tight so lets round down to 15,000 pages.    Lets drop that even more because of binding, pages that aren't 100% full, and so on.  12,000 pages (20% drop).  Now lets assume 20 lines per page (it's probably printed landscape).

anybody got any way for us to check that?
what I like about this image is that she's obviously proud, but not necessarily because of the recognition she's getting.  she's not posing as a boast the way most people do this kind of shot, like ""look how big my &ldquo;code&rdquo; is.""  instead she looks genuinely thrilled about the work and what it represents.  the commemorative aspects are secondary to the fulfillment of the task itself.Wish women like this were role models, not that twat kardashian..This looks like the person, also named Margret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West in ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1939. Maybe a daughter or grand-daughter.My grandfather worked with her on the apollo code, I was always interested in Space and they were one of the reasons why. Telling me about the women that did these amazing things and that if I worked hard enough I could do so much too. My grandfather had a ton of careers and about has his life spent getting all sorts of degrees, I was always so curious why on earth he would walk away from a program like this, he just said he wanted to do something else. Take note, Mattel. [deleted]That isn't code.  In the video they infer that this is the output of a botched program.

EDIT: Hi everyone... I'm honoured that people like my work, but I have been overwhelmed by the amount of personal photoshop requests that I've been receiving.  My heart breaks to know that so many of you have lost loved ones and I wish I had the time to devote to every one of you.  But please, before you PM me, I really urge you to submit your request to /r/picrequests/, /r/photoshoprequest/, or  [http://www.babyangelpics.com](http://www.babyangelpics.com) as there are many other talented photoshop artists that would be just as willing to help out.I did a paint over for you (painting over the photo itself): http://imgur.com/tf9CbVs
I took some liberties with the color, and background, PM me if you would like the psd, or want any changes.

Edit: thank you very much for the kind comments and the goldnot photoshop, but a small [sketch](http://imgur.com/FUJzpuS).I'm very sorry... My son is 9 months old and I couldn't sleep without at least trying.  
http://i.imgur.com/9jJ1UiJ.jpgA fellow I worked with at a previous job came up to me one day and said ""you're good with photoshop, right?""  to which I responded, ""i guess, what can i do for you?""  

He emailed me photo of a baby - his baby.  His wife had given birth the day before.  The baby looked a bit off, eyes closed, skin a slightly greyish tone and what looked like a small tear at the side of her mouth. otherwise she looked like any other baby: knit hat and tiny little gloves, I figured she was asleep.

He asked me - ""Can you get rid of some of the crap that's on her face and maybe brighten up her skin a little?  It's the only photo we were able to take.""

I said sure, of course.  So I went home and spent a while tidying up her photo, smoothing out the little bits of stuff that were on her skin until I was happy with what I had done.

I sent the photo off to him asking if it was all right.

he emailed me back and thanked me and thanked me kept thanking me and he says at the end of all this ""She passed away an hour after she was born and this was the only photo we got of her before they took her away"".

I won't lie, it still makes me sad to think about it, but I know that how I feel is a millionth of what he must feel.

You have my deepest condolences, she is a lovely girl.

EDIT - To the person who gave me Gold - thank you, that was very kind of you :)  It's greatly appreciatedFor anyone that finds themselves in this tragic situation, there is an amazing charity called [Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep](https://www.nowilaymedowntosleep.org). They are an organization of photographers that will travel to the hospital you're in so you can capture the memories of your son or daughter. They are really amazing people, it is something so simple that really makes a huge differenceThis is why I am so happy Photoshop exists.

[Here is what I came up with](http://imgur.com/CVPx68P) 

I started with /u/tacothecat first correction and went from there, so he is largly to thank as well. I am sorry for your loss, and am just happy I could help in any way I can. She is so beautiful.

Edit:  worked on some of the rest.

Edit:  [Final version for tonight](http://i.imgur.com/6gVlEQC.jpg) incorporating some suggestions.  There are a lot of artists that are much better than me doing some great renditions further down the comment chain.  Everyone should check them out.Hi OP, not sure you'll see this since you have so many replies, but I'd love to do a drawing or painting of your daughter (whichever you prefer) if you're interested. I'll mail you the physical piece as well.

I'm so sorry about your loss, she was beautiful.

Edit: I'd like to add, it doesn't have to be of this picture- I could do a portrait of her in any way, or even of you and/or your wife holding her.

Edit2: This was done rather quickly as I'm not at home, but I did a sketch of your daughter without the tubes. Not quite the same as a photo edit, but I hope it suffices. I'd still love to do a real portrait of your daughter though. http://i.imgur.com/ISdtIy3.jpgTook Markaes' one (http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2ajul6/photoshop_request_my_daughter_recently_passed/ciw3jtu) and fixed some discolorations, removed moisture around eyes, and evened out the skin tone a bit more. https://i.imgur.com/JA4OOTu.png

edit: thanks for the gold, pingouins.Is there a video source for this?For those who want a little more background behind the photo: 

The photo was taken at the 2002 Tour de France, the rider is Dave Watson. The jump was over a group of 12 riders at the back of the pelaton during the Alp d'Huez stage, just before the summit of the col de Galibier. He only had a look at the jump before hand and couldn't even do a practice run in to the lip of the drop for fear of giving away his intentions to the many police below. After jumping the 45ft down on his Kona Stab Supreme, Dave unfortunately bailed pretty bad on the landing. After picking himself up he was taken to hospital but walked away that day with a partially separated shoulder, sore neck and a bruised back and groin. You can watch a video of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1YlFQVTBuI) from the Freeride Entertainment film New World Disorder 4 - Ride The Lightning

Edit: Added the name of the bikehow much Mountain Dew did this guy drink?This was the photo that got me into Downhill mountain biking. I still remember the day this was posted on a local forum, Dropmachine.com, that I used to frequent. I printed this photo off and had it pasted everywhere, in my binders, walls, everything.

Because those things are so loud and annoying I also brought a screwdriver so I could take out the batteries during class time. My parents thought it was a great idea as well since they knew how annoying those things could be.  
Anyways, the second my teacher saw the screw driver she freaked out and sent me to the principal's office who promptly called my mom. They wanted to suspende me for 3 days because I had a ""weapon"". My parents were furious and refused to let me be suspended. They kept asking if I had threatened another student or harmed another student. But just the fact that I had it was enough. I ended up not getting suspended and just warned not to bring anything like that again.  
TL;DR - Brought a screwdriver to school to keep my Furby quiet. Almost got suspended. Awesome parents said no.In other news, a local student has been arrested for possession of a bag of Lays potato chips. School authorities became concerned when they realized that the bag could be used to cause [air embolisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_embolism) in both students and teachers. 

The bag was confiscated and no major injuries were reported, although a few students were hospitalized as a precaution.

 A hearing will be held later today amid allegations that the boy's parents did not do enough to prevent this threat. For now the boy has been placed in a foster home, until it is determined whether or not his parents are fit to maintain custody of him.Zero-Tolerance policies force schools to use zero logic when determining how to keep kids safe.All the faculty and any student with a paper clip should be suspended then. Wouldn't want to have double standards now, would we?The death of common sense. When my brother was about ten and still in middle school, we ended up having a huge fight with a school about a similar situation. While my little brother was out playing on school grounds (either gym class or recess), he found a pocket knife on the field. Being a good kid with never an ill intent, he picked it up and took it straight to a teacher, and told her exactly where and how he found it. Instead of commending him  for turning it in immediately, the lady freaks out, shouting at my brother that 'how dare he bring a weapon to school'. She got him suspended, with the idea that ""well if it must have been his. He should have left it on the playground"". I was completely dumbfounded that the first response was that my brother was lying, that turning it over to proper authority meant nothing, and moreover, that he should have left a dangerous object on the playground, during a mixed-age recess.[**PUT YOUR HANDS UP WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM.

(1st grade) I brought a tiny [cap gun]( http://imgur.com/cvtH4j0) that I found on the sidewalk the day before. 
I showed my friends and we were just passing it around. 

Hours later at lunch, a girl yelled out ""RICKY HAS A GUN!!!""
I didn't even have it out, it was just in my backpack but I guess someone told her or she saw it before and just decided to yell it out loud now. 

So a guy grabs me and pushes me to the ground and asks where is it. So I opened my backpack and gave it to him. 
They called my mom and she came to the school. They told her that I will get suspended and most likely expelled. 

I got suspended for a couple days.

Maybe I would understand it if I was aiming at people or making threats but I was just a kid showing off a new toy I found.

Edit: Also their reason for suspending me was because it's modeled after a real gun.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJAaI6iGCOkThe context lacking here is a concern. You would think on an official report like this, you'd list more than just having it. I agree that he could be poking or somesuch with it. That said, it's not stated here so we can only speculate.

That aside, looking at where it says ""referral/infraction"" and it lists ""Sharp object/weapon"" is horribly misleading. Having bent tons of paperclips before, the worst you could do is poke an eye out. Which if that happened you'd figure the report would say ""Kid poked another kid's eye out.""

The nemesis crushed the outer races one by one until only their creators, the Precursors, remained. When all seemed lost, the  Precursors stored the secrets to their advanced technology within a single device. The device was sent far beyond known space in the hopes of aiding in the defeat of their own creation. Eventually it landed upon a planet with no apparent intelligent life. The primitive beings there found the device, cut it into pieces, and polished them to be sold as trinkets.

The glyphs of clock hands at the respective hour for the clock hands are in the places which tell you the hands are in a particular place.

Or in simpler terms, the glyphs themselves show where the hour points are regardless of what they look like.

As such, they're not completely useless.

If they weren't there and the clock was rotated by an unknown number of degrees it would be impossible to tell the time or the orientation of the clock.

In that sense, the glyphs are slightly better than dots in those positions.

Closer to the Leavenworth than I thought!My mother-in-law lives in Leavenworth and sent me an email explaining the situation along with this photo. Credit for the picture goes to Michael Stanford who took this photo.I have so many fond memories of Leavenworth. I hope the fires get under control soon.Hi there, Oregon Wildland Firefighter/Type 6 Engineer checking in here.

Education is also part of my job description, so ask away with any fire related questions. Such respect for the people who work with this.I can smell it from Spokane.


Edit: Plugging /r/SpokaneI loved going to Leavenworth. Especially during Oktoberfest. Good times can be had by all. 
My brother just got called up (National Guard) to assist fighting fires in Washington. Can fires really jump rivers? That's incredible. How does it happen?I live 30 min away and that fire is one of four in central Washington. I could barely stand 8 feet away from a bonfire of 3 christmas trees before I felt like I was getting toasted.

Incredible what these guys put up with.A friend of mine is there fighting fire right now. I have never met anyone as passionate as him about his job. And I am glad people like him exist. He is doing an incredible job and savings lives. Prayers to all those evacuated and for my friend. I hope everyone stays safe and it gets contained soon. Seriously a scary situation, especially when I have friends and family that live so close. A lot of folks lost their homes in Pateros, hope Leavenworth homes stay safe.  We helped get some drinking water to the firefighters today but more donations are welcome:  
https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Salvation-Army-Retail-Store-Wenatchee-WA/264419070346659This is my home! The whole valley is just destroyed right now. You cant walk outside without choking on smoke fumes.The real MVPsAmazing photo.  Props to the people fighting these fires, as well.    
    
As an aside, I learned a couple years ago what exactly ""containment"" meant when reporting on wild-fires.  It's the % of a fire around which there is a fire-line or some other natural or human-made boundary to stop its spread. haha, I thought you said something about Washington! On a side note, this picture of Mordor is fantastic!My Freinds unit for the national guard just got activated a couple days ago to help. I might go too soon, but were a medical company, hopefully no one gets hurt.My cousin is National Guard. She's up there helping with the fight as well. For anyone interested, this is the official site for the Leavenworth fire:  http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/3976/I'm so, so grateful to these men and women. My family cabin that my grandfather built is only a few miles from the Chiwaukum Creek Fire that's up against Highway 2, and firefighters are the only thing keeping my favorite place on Earth safe. Thanks, guys! Stay safe!i live in index, wa, right up the highway. hopefully leavenworth doesnt burn, icicle brewing co is too good to go.For those of you outside of Washington state, Leavenworth is a major tourist attraction for us.  It's a small, quaint little town in central Washington, and it's Bavarian themed.  All of the buildings are made to look like a Bavarian mountain town.  There is a large Oktoberfest celebration every year, complete with polka bands, yodelers, and laderhosen (spelling?).My thoughts are with the people that give their lives so that ours may continue, many of us unaffected. I used to love Leavenworth when I was a kid.  Such a cool town to visit. Hopefully not too much is lost.

It was so bizarre, because it is *huge* -- utterly towers over the town which has no other tall buildings.  The facility was fully staffed, maintained, and everything -- but practically deserted.
 
They operated a club lounge, including an attendant, apparently for me alone as I never saw another person there.  The lobby bar had like three people (and substantially more employees) at peak time.

But the view on it from the sourrounding bridges is awesome, too (generally, prague is an awesome place)I love this track in forza Looks like something out of Assassin's CreedI touched a statues penis on that bridge. I have been 10 years old for at least a decade now...For anyone curious, the photo is taken from The Charles Bridge, a bridge much older than the United States itself. Prague is such a beautiful city, best visited in warmer months, that shit gets cold. 
e - Both the bridge itself and the statutes on the bridge are beautiful. Here is a slide show of the statues

Was this bridge where they shot the scene in Mission Impossible? /r/movies?Charles Bridge is where my wife and I shared our first kiss at 5am one winter night in 2006. We had spent the night wandering the city, going into pubs, chatting at a mile a minute amazed the connection we were finding. She told me as the night wore on that she always wished she could see Charles Bridge like it is in the postcards (or this picture, for that matter) with lovely light and no people. Karluv Most is normally packed full of tourists, trinket sellers and tramps. Feeling bold, I told her that if she went there with me right then instead of going home that I promised it would be just like the postcards. Sure enough, there wasn't a single soul on the bridge. And just as the sun started to rise, after touching the lucky St. John of Nepomuk statue, we kissed. There was no way we weren't getting married after that.

Amazing architecture and the cheapest beer you will ever find.

But don't go expecting to find the Charles bridge that empty. It's pretty much always packed. Instead, at dusk go stop in a sideshop, pick up a few beers, and spend the night drinking in Old Town Square until the wee hours of the morning.

Also, for a great drinking place with stellar view of the Charles Bridge and the Prauge Castle there is a beer garden on the bank of the river to the south east of the Bridge. Don't remember the name but check it out.  [This is the stellar view from my less than stellar phone camera](http://i.imgur.com/FiYV0cH.jpg)I love Prague.

I seriously doubt a flying bullet going at supersonic speed would penetrate through another bullet *in the middle*, the conflicting velocities would have made it all go into pieces.The astronomical number of variables that had to be just perfect for this to happen boggle the mind.

If both had hit each other mid flight there would be more deformation parallel the the velocity or direction of travel of both bullets, instead of primarily only the one.

I caught an ant and I threw it into my toilet with a piece of toilet paper. The paper was spread out evenly over the water, and you could see the ant under it, walking upside down along the paper's surface. He was visibly struggling to find a way out of this watery prison, scurrying around for a good 8 seconds. Then suddenly, silence, he stopped moving, his struggle stopped, and he drifted to the bottom. I had killed him. But not only that, but I watched him in his final moments as he struggled for survival, and then surrendered to the void. Can it breathe or is it drowning?I have to say, I think this photo is fake. The water drop is perfectly spherical. The ant is uniformly textured. Those are very think antennae. Insects usually bend the opposite way, inwards. hello darkness my old friend...

Sometimes we have to move the full-size ones and it requires the use of a giant shovel and they hiss the entire time and want to kill you.Rule #1: Anything that gets near a Snapping Turtle's mouth is food until it changes its mind.

Rule #2: Snapping Turtles do not change their minds when it comes to food.I fucking love snapping turtles. I move them off of roadways every chance I get. I tell people it's for the turtle's safety, but honestly I just like being near the giant turtles.

Edit: missed a word and punctuation I saw a snapper a little smaller than that on the road once. I grabbed a decent sized stick to scoot it off of the road. That sucker stretched it's neck out at incredible speed and snapped the end off that stick. I decided it wasn't worth a finger to try to move it.That's a snapping turtle.

Some snapping turtles have a sac they can extrude out into the water and wave around so that it functions like a very crude gill.

The sac extends out of their cloaca.

Basically, it's ass.I took these last summer, about 2 weeks apart. the one of the guy on the yellow line looks smaller, but that fucker was HUGE I was a little bit scared to get closer!

http://i.imgur.com/swtf8ml.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/aPbcO6I.jpgIn one of my old neighborhoods we had a problem with snapping turtles put-putting around. One of my neighbors caught one and put it in a wheel barrel to bring down to the rock quarry. He then found another one and put it in with the first. I have NEVER heard anything like that in my life. Lesson learned: don't go near snapping turtles and DO NOT enclose more than one in an area that small. Interestingly [turtles are a distant relative to dinosaurs](https://chickenoreggblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/reptiletree.jpg) while birds are not only direct descendants of certain dinosaurs, they phylogenetically *are* dinosaurs. Interesting to think about the next time you see a pigeon, chicken, or a [cassowary](http://biologypop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cassowary-drumming.jpg).

Look at them [dinosaur feet](http://creepyanimals.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/cassowary.jpg).Odds are she's crossing the road and there is a nest of her babies across the street, keep your eye out for em they can camouflage them self's quite nicely in the asphalt.PSA since it's spring and turtles are waking up and breeding.

If you see a turtle/tortiose crossing the road, help it across in the direction it was going. Typically these are females looking to lay their eggs and they don't always nest near water.

Source: Volunteered at a wildlife hospital, pretty much every hit-by-car turtle/tortoise we got was female, including a snapper like in OP's pic that was hit by 3 trucks (she lived and was released)! Most of these cases were in spring-early summer.Snapping turtles are no joke. Last summer I almost hit one with my car when it was trying to cross the road. I got all upset and decided I was going to rescue it and bring it to the other side. I had no idea what it was--I thought it was just a huge ass regular dopey turtle. I reached down and picked it up and quickly realized my mistake when it almost sliced open my wrist. It was MAD AS SHIT. I gave up, started to walk back to my car and then decided that I was not going to let a turtle defeat me. I went back to my car, grabbed my huge winter coat, went back to the dinosaur and threw the coat over him. I picked him up (at least 45lbs), helped him cross, and plopped him down in a  ditch. The inside of my coat had tears in it. I felt like a goddamn hero.That thing is awesome. I want to be friends with it.That's just Tokka looking for Rahzar. Look at all the nope.They like it when you scratch them on their nose.[Another freaking dinosaur](http://www.avesdeceuta.com/principal/especies/gorrion_moruno/4.jpg)Saw a couple of these mating once. I was fishing and I saw some huge bulge next to the bank on the opposite side of the stream, couldn't really tell what it was. Maybe a huge beaver? It wasn't until the male turtle dismounted that I realized I'd just witnessed two turtles fucking. He just kinda leaned back and then splashed into the water shell first, like ""AAAAND I'M DONE.""[deleted]OP, where do you live?

The scenery is absolutely amazing.The saturation in this is making my eyes hurt.I would like to go there before it melts. As a Montanan, fuck everyone, our state is best.going there tomorrow!

I was frustrated at first until he looks up at me and says ""I've been saving my allowance and helping neighbors all year to buy this."" The mother gave me this really apologetic look and says he insisted he pay for it with the money he earned. Was just too cute for me to be angry.As a previous employee of Best Buy, I'm familiar with this type of customer, and there's one thing I can promise you: he complained about how long it took to check out.As a jew this is a little awkwardDont know about the States but in Canada you can refuse payment like that. Anything more than 27 coins I believe.That's a lot of broken parking metersthe guy couldn't have gone to a bank beforehand to exchange the quarters for cash??? what a prick. poor craig robinson...This is what those of us who have cashiered refer to as ""The Baggy"".

The customer approaches you with their purchase(es), perhaps wearing a slight smile and greeting you kindly. You ring up their items, exchanging in some well-worn small talk that you have used over and over again for the past few hours. When you inform the customer of their total, the customer suddenly says, ""I hope you don't mind change.""

And there it is. Before then it had only been heard of in legend, mentioned in the tales of other more seasoned cashiers that have seen every horror of the job. You had scoffed at it then--how badly could a baggy be, after all? But then you see it yourself, unable to help yourself from cringing at the sound of the weight of coinage being dropped upon your counter. You look from The Baggy to the total, and then to the line of customers gathering behind The Baggy Holder.

You realize that you cannot be defeated. Not by this. Certainly not by a pile of coins and the piece of plastic that contains them. You must endure so that one day you are able to tell this tale in hopes to warn another unfortunate soul about the existance of The Baggy.

You open The Baggy with trembling hands and begin the count...the stereotype lives on.Used to work at a movie theater.  Teens would come in and ask to see an R rated movie they were clearly not old enough to see and dump a bag of pennies on my counter and giggle.  So I'd count them.  Slowly.  Purposefully.  They'd begin to get impatient (2 minutes before the movie, hurry up!)  Then I'd ""lose"" count.  Gotta start again.  Finally they would just stand there and fume.  I'd finish, let them know they had enough, then ask for ID.  None of them even bothered to try to bring a fake one.  Booted them out.

Give me pennies, prepare to wait mofo's.The guy counting the quarters is probably thinking *""what the fuck am I doing with my life""*he should have paid with the gold he keeps hidden in a bag around his neck.As a person who works in retail, fuck people like this. This has happened so many times at my store that my manager has told me I don't have to accept large payments that are made with change. Seriously is it so hard to go to the bank and get bills?That is a total dick move. I get if you are proud that you saved up enough quarters to buy an iPod, but stop by the fucking bank first and cash that shit in. Don't make the poor sales guy deal with that shit. Illegal to do that in Canada. You're only allowed to use quarters for purchases up to $10.

** (2) A payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:
(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and
(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

[Source](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/page-1.html#s-8.)What a douche bag. When I was a bank teller a common customer came in with fucking $600 of unsorted change. I tried to explain to him that a branch just 2 miles away had a change sorting machine but we didn't. 

I was also the only teller working for that 2 hours, which is about how long it took me. He also told me that he had counted and I was off by $30. 

I almost quit right there. ... He actually looks like the kind of guy who owns a small, yet successful, chain of laundromats and a handful of vending machines.

Of course, that same look applies to a great number of private investigators as well.  They just usually don't have the quarters like this guy does.

(Polo shirt, not quite physically fit, constantly on phone or internet so as to keep things moving in the business).This guy is being a jerk. He's a grown ass man who could easily go to bank to get his coins counted up and pay with bills.  And yet here he is on his smart phone wasting his and everyone's time.Why did he have to be wearing a kippah? We've come so far. And now we're back at square one.

Oy vey.I know this is never going to get read, but all comments regarding the Jewish stereotype and poor retail worker aside this really reflects poorly on the management.  If I was a supervisor at this Best Buy and I saw this going on I would have pulled this man aside and counted the quarters myself, in an office, while I would have my cashier service other customers.  Just because you have an inconsiderate customer doesn't mean that you should let your other customers and your employees suffer.  Simply tell them ""We are not a bank""and the best buy guy should have taken the extra few minutes and sifted through the  quarters for silver. there was no doubt probably 15-30 silver quarters. tell your boss you need change and swap out a $20 for the silver quarters. would have made the counting of  quarters worth it.While I was in college, a grad student across the hall from me saved up his change from the time he was like 12.  

He bought a 56"" flatscreen with it.  About $2000, all in a giant crayon that weighed probably 200 lbs.  

The Best Buy crew had to count it out at customer service.  Took about three hours.When I was a Supervisor at Best Buy I'd happily go grab the change counter from Ops room and use it count that shit.

Those types of customer are either looking for an argument or think that putting some minimum wage high school kid through the wringer is *fun*. Taking away their fun is the only way to win.Assuming he bought a 16 GB iPad Mini at $329, with tax comes out to roughly $350. This is about 1400 quarters. If the cashier counted the quarters for 15 minutes, he counted about 93 quarters every minute, which is 3 quarters every 2 seconds.

I was once employed by DirecTV, which claims exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package. Each year, the top seller of the Sunday Ticket package in each DirecTV call center was given some recognition and award by the NFL. It so happens that a friend of mine (Jason) won for our call center and the prize for that year was to fly out for a weekend trip on location for the filming of an advertisement for Sunday Ticket.  Mr. Manning was being featured in the ad and all of the award recipients and their guests were to do a meet and greet with him during filming. I asked Jason if he would be willing to take a football card and have it signed, to which he agreed.

When Jason returned from the trip, he presented me with the signed card (personalized to me) and told me about his meeting with Mr. Manning. He said there were something like twenty people that had gone on the trip, and that Mr. Manning had apparently requested small bios of all of those who we're coming to the meet and greet. When they arrived, he addressed each of them by name and talked with every one of them personally about their lives and thanked them all for their efforts to help market the NFL, etc. He also joked around with all of them while he was filming the ad and was just generally very personable and great.

Since having learned about the events of that trip, I have always had a high opinion of Mr. Manning, feeling that his treatment of those in attendance was far above what many players would offer in a similar circumstance.

TL;DR - Peyton Manning treats a bunch of fans very well during a meet and greet.I like that he took the time to fill in the ""r"" in ""Mr"" before his signature.When PM was in his final year in Indy during the injury season, some family friends would see him before the game pull into the players lot in his car before the game as they tailgated across from the entrance. (One time he even rolled down his window and jokingly asked for a hotdog.)

During the final home game of the year, after seeing the same die hard group there through every game in that season where the Colts went 2-14, he approached the group before the game unsolicited and thanked them for their support during the long year and posed with some pictures at their tailgate spot.

He will always be my favorite athlete of all time, and even though we are set up better for the future with Andrew Luck, I miss Peyton every time I see him play.I'm pretty sure Ryan Leaf is available.Plot twist: OP's sister's fiancee is Eli Manning.Peyton is all class.What an idiot.

That's the boat I did my military service on in the Swedish navy (a Göteborg-class corvette), HMS Kalmar. We docked in Muskö during the summer for some maintenance and that place is huge. Coolest thing was that there was a sub docked in the adjacent room so we got to see it in all its glory out of water. We rode bikes in there to get around due to how big it is, there's even a ""in case of war"" hospital in that block of rock. There's also a ""weapons museum"" that try to have every handheld weapon on stock where, if you're lucky like my friend was, you could try some really cool guns like a Desert Eagle or a sniper rifle like a Dragunov.

My oldest son is almost 11, and I still say those first few weeks and months of fatherhood were the best of my life.  Like, by a long shot.  They're still tons of fun, but it's a different kind of fun, and nothing compares to the first few weeks of the parenting experience.  Enjoy.Week Negative 40 of Fatherhood - Eating out. 

awesome!Normally don't upvote kid posts. You're an exception. Cherish it, you magnificent, funny bastard.See this is what my wife couldn't get her head around.

Baby is sleeping, alright? We all know you don't wake up a sleeping baby. He's happy and chilled out.

I'm hapy because i'm sitting for hte first time in what feels like a century, and I'm eating something messy

I can't move the kid, and I don't really care about how funny it looks, and if I get FOOD on the baby, the wife will make my life hell forever.

So I put a napkin on his head... makes sense. He doesn't care. I don't care.

Then I looked down and saw the blue go deep into nothingness. I have never been more freaked out in my life.I have a little [Different Version](http://i.imgur.com/aFvu2G8) as a desktop background [One more goes in...](http://i.imgur.com/Q67kO.jpg)Does anyone else see the faded image in the background that looks vaguely like [Bruce] (http://www.lnt.com/photos/product/giant/114420S580256/aquarium-character-ornaments/finding-nemo-shark-aquarium-background.jpg)?[Reminds me of the Myst guy](http://guminmyhair.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/myst.jpg)[Obligatory](http://xkcd.com/1040/large/)I suffer from a morbid fear of swimming in any water where I can not see the bottom.
I avoid swimming in lakes, rivers, ponds, etc...
I am a scuba diver though.

[What I saw:](http://i.imgur.com/9xNannc.jpg)I was stationed on a coast guard patrol boat in St. Thomas,  which is adjacent to the Puerto Rico trench.  We occasionally stopped for swim call in deep water - like 18000-25000 feet of water.    That always freaked me me the fuck out. 

 I would be fine for about 5 min or so, or as long as I was goofing off jumping off of shit or whatever.  Eventually I would have a quiet moment underwater and remember that there were four or five MILES of water beneath me.  Dark, cold water with nightmarish living things in it.  Nobody knows what the fuck is down there. 

 I don't think I want to know,either. 

 That would end my recreational swim and I would get my chicken ass back on the cutter and volunteer for shark watch. 

 It was also freaky pulling out of San Juan Harbor and watching the Fathometer become completely non-functional, just spinning endlessly as you sailed over the edge of a 20000 foot cliff.That mini heart attack when entering a large body of water[reality](http://i.imgur.com/r6F9pck.jpg)This is a terrifying picture. This is awesome, but it also freaks me out.

I would get the same feelings playing WoW, whenever an underwater quest would take you to the edge of the fatigue zone and you could see the floor drop off into terrifying watery nothingness.

This sounds really lame outside of my head.The sum of all my fearsAnd [how it all ends.] (http://imgur.com/0Gann4h.jpg)Anyone else have that irrational fear that as soon as you jump into the ocean your body will somehow lose it's ability to float and you'll sink like a stone deep into the blackness while you scream and scream until you're out of your breath and you're forced to take another and the water fills your lungs as the darkness swallows you up?Okay.

World champion Guillaume Nery deep diving without equipment into Blue Hole.One day, a couple years ago, I decided to go para sailing. It was awesome. It was a wonderfully sunny day and the water was uncharacteristically clear, which really enhanced the whole experience. Before we get ready to ""take off"" the boat guy says, ""we can either bring you in dry, or drop you in the water."" My SO was stoked and decided quickly that we would be dropped. Fast forward to being 2000 feet up looking at all this amazing sea life.The water wasn't super deep and we can see like huge ass jelly fish, Sharks EVERYWHERE and sea turtles and things of that nature. It was pretty rad, up until the moment we start descending and I realize I'm about to dropped into this body of water that I now know is just full of things that want to kill me. I haven't been to the beach since. We paid to get pictures of us and all of the shots of us coming in and out of the water of me trying to physically lift my body out of the water. This picture reminded me of this.It being big and empty like that doesn't scare me at all.  If the ocean was really like that I'd have no qualms about swimming in it.  

It's the fact that it's full of sharks, jellyfish and swimming knives that keeps me away.  That and the smell.  Okay so it's mostly the smell, so sue me.[same picture but zoomed out a bit](http://i.imgur.com/hbEtnfb.jpg)Reminds me of my favorite part of Moby Dick:

After Pip the cabin-boy falls overboard. He can swim, but the ship takes forever to turn around and rescue him.

""The sea had leeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his God.""the sea is dark and full of terrorsMy screensaver was this for quite some time.

[Here's the commercial for the promotion from 1984.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfSNDxQ3HWk&t=0m36s)I always wondered how my grandparents could have such ancient food in cupboards. They'd always assure me they'd ""Just gotten it a little while ago"" even though the expiration dates were from the previous decade.

Now that I'm in my 30s I can see how it happens. I have Au Gratin potatoes that expired in 2008, and it still *seems* like I just got those on a 10 for $10 sale ""a little while ago."" 5 years ago seems like such a short period of time even now...can't imagine what time feels like to an 80 year old.With my grandma, it was Dr. Pepper.  After riding my bike over, always a cold frosty bottle.  And lots of homemade Irish soda bread, slathered in butter.  Memories :)

*I see now you were making fun of the date on the package, not the fact that you love to go to Gram's and have a tall glass of cold chocolate milk.  Doesn't matter, I'll still leave my good memory here.I just realized there are children now who will grow up knowing only ""Nesquik"".my grandma has some old food stuff in her kitchen including nestle quik. i've always wondered at what point it goes from, ""i can still use this!"" to ""it's an antique! i can't possibly get rid of it!"" though it might be better to say when keeping turns to saving.

Jesus...the diabetes I tried to give my self as a kid with strawberry quik.My grandma has spices from 1972. The year my mother graduated from high school. I remember when they switched from the metal tins to the round cardboard cylinders... I was devastated as a kid and refused to believe it was the same product.

(Doesn't have to make sense, I was a kid)I used to sprinkle this stuff on plain Cheerios with milk. The chocolate would get stuck in the middles of the Cheerios (awesome) and you'd have chocolate milk after (also awesome).  Many years ago I went over to my best friend Steve's house.  It was a Sunday and being Italian, he was going to his grandma's for the weekly family dinner.  We walked in and were offered drinks from a cupboard.  She offered Yoohoo and juice and whatnot.  We took the Yoohoo and by chance checked the sell by date to discover that the shit was like 7 years old.  Steve and I tried to hold on to the boxed Yoohoos  for as long as we could finding it amusing that they were ""vintage"".  Well his eventually got thrown out by his mom somewhere along the line, but I kept mine in the back of the fridge for several years until I moved into the dorms at college.  One night a friend was hanging out in the room when I brought up my vintage Yoohoo in conversation and told him it was approximately 11 years old.  That crazy motherfucker didn't even bother with the straw and just ripped the top of the box open.  Naturally I couldn't let this opportunity go by and took a sip.  That shit must be full of preservatives because it wasn't half bad.not quite as bad, but just recently, I found a box of instant oatmeal in my dad's kitchen that was dated '99...he had moved twice since then. I was like, ""do you mean to tell me, you have been packing up expired food and moving it with you, not only once, but ***twice*?**Well, you just rendered me absolutely catatonic.  Thanks for bringing me back to being 11.  I'm 35 now...guess I'll go sit in the corner and lament ever aging.  Fuck.Put... Put your Quik in it.I used to play this game too, but with my grandma it was a box of Rice Krispies with Jackson 5 stickers until about 2000ish.Metal cans! I miss those old metal quick cans, they made great penny banks as a kid.Jokes on you, she just fills it up with new Nesquik whenever they run out.I recently (About 7~ months ago) went through my mothers cupboards oin the kitchen.

Jesus, the shit I threw out... I can't really remember everything, but I do remember throwing out a box of Tapioca pudding that was so old, it didn't have ingredients, or nutritional info. So it's gotta predate the 80s, easily.

Also threw out a jar of bread yeast from 1992. And there was the box of some sort of grain product or something, the best before date was 1982.

Edit: There were also 3 boxes of freeze dried roast beef TV dinners that got thrown out. ...They were easily pre-1980.

Oh! This happened a while back, but still relevant.

Up until 2008... My parents had a Can of Bacon strips sitting in the basement. It was from the 1970s. <_<

They bought it in the United States.

ALSO, HE-MANI have fond memories of waking up saturday morning making some nestle quick and watching abc cartoons then firing up the nes... good times.. About a decade ago I found some hamburger meat in my parents freezer that was dated 1998-99 (I think there were two packages). It became known as the ""Clinton era meat"". Every couple of years I'd check up on it to make sure they didn't find it and throw it away. Eventually it made it past the Bush administration and well into Obama's first term. I think about a year ago I checked only find that it was missing. When I asked my folks about it, I discovered that my mom had thrown it away. Apparently she didn't find the novelty of having hamburger meat that old in her freezer as amusing as I did. Somewhere I have a picture I could dig up if someone was actually interested.Went to my EXTREMELY cheap, but rich aunts house out of state. I went to the fridge to grab a jar of jelly and it had at least an INCH of mold growing ontop. Now, my uncles a hard core hoarder, and he told me to throw it away without her knowing. She went into the trash, got it out, and PUT IT BACK INTO THE FRIDGE. she said she could scrape it off. Did you win?[I do the same thing with this](http://i.imgur.com/usLp9D1.jpg)That's awesome!

To be more specific - this monument is in Akademgorodok (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok), a rather small part of Novosibirsk with a crapload of research institutes and is filled with scientists. Also located almost in the middle of the forest, with a nice beach not so far away. A nice little place.

Source: born and raised there.I wanted to point out that there are other monuments of this kind. Best known are the ones related to Pavlov, who advanced his research by conducting some disturbing experiments on dogs and was irritated by protests of animal protectors of his era, but respected lab animals deeply. There's [a statue of Pavlov himself](http://dic.academic.ru/pictures/wiki/files/77/MonumentIPAVLOV.jpg) and of  [a dog](http://www.animalmonument.ru/images/pamytnik-2.jpeg).
Words on the postament are as follows:

Their DNA is a bit easier to manipulate and have allowed for genetic knockouts, various mutations, and the beginning of optogenetics which will soon be a very big deal in regards to human applications. I don't think computer models will ever completely do away with live animal models, due to the complexity and novel experimental methods, particularly due to implications  in Neurobiology and Behavior.

make up your mind, either you want the coverage or you dont, because this is how it will be regardless. So should they stop?

We need them to bring these images to the public.

If a byproduct of this happens to be that every once in a while a group of them have to gather as a group taking the same picture for different publications...then I think that's worth the benefits.This is absolutely disgusting. Why haven't these photographers been given chairs?So what you're saying here, is that behind every media photograph is a professional photographer? I'm shocked.I don't get what the point here is.Oh for fuck's sake, not this again.

Those guys there are photographers. Their job is to photograph things. They earn a living that way. If you think that they should help the locals (they can't help the girl, she's dead) or if they should go and do something better, well, maybe you should show them how it's done instead of complaining how the media is shit?BUT WHO TOOK A PICTURE OF THE MEDIA??Did you just completely trick me into looking at a dead body? God damnit reddit, stop this shit. I'll just leave this [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYbW_ukhfjQ)/r/morbidrealityIt's the job of a photojournalist to make compelling and artistically beautiful pieces that can accurately and honestly depict an event. 

Nothing more.

It sounds cold, but even in the case where a photographer could have given aid (the girl in this image was long gone when they arrived), chances are they don't have the medical background to remove a bullet or offer any form of assistance. So they are going to do what they are there to do, document the incident. 

You people wouldn't get on your moral high-horse about the writers of the story who are probably running around the place with their pen/paper/tablets, or the publishers who are paying the photographers, or the families these photojournalist have to feed. No you would rather sit behind a computer and bash someone's profession.

Photographer here, and I'm sick of seeing people constantly bitching about the ethics behind the profession. It takes a lot of skill, training, and thought to produce a piece that is news worthy, I know from personal experience that photographers go tunnel vision sometimes and forget that they exist beyond the lens. It's not that these people are necessarily bad, they are just trying to do their job.

These people are getting paid to go to dangerous parts of the world and risk their lives to provide you, the news consuming community, with photographers and stories. 

Show them some respect.
Reddit confuses the shit out of me.  One minute front page is full of journalists exposing the horror of the Egyptian protests, the next journalists are being somewhat vilified for exposing the horrible truths of the world.Although she is dead, it reminds of the story of the photographer who captured that starving child who couldn't make it to UN food trucks, he later committed suicide because he didn't do anything. Yes, sometimes the images are important, but sometimes putting down the fucking camera and doing something about it is more important. Don't forget a lot of these people are doing it for the cash or fame, not to spread the word. Maybe it would be different if there weren't ten people getting the same fucking image when most news organizations choose one photo off the wire. pointless titleI'd hate it to get my picture taken while asleep...What do you expect those photographers to do, OP?  Drag a badly injured/dead girl to another location?  Your title should read ""Behind the scenes of photographing a dead girl""If they weren't photographing they wouldn't be there to help anyway.  I agree with Evis03.  Depending on the situation they do put the camera down to help.  In this case there is nothing to help, the girl is already dead.  And as for being out to make a quick buck...have you seen most of these guys salaries.  You couldn't get me near a war zone for the peanuts they pay most of these photographers.  They do what they do to help spread a message.  It is pretty selfless.  Afterall they aren't the paparazzi. Why is this wrong? They can't bring her back to life. The best thing they can do is to show other people. That is their job. These people go into war torn countries and show the rest of the world what is happening as they see it, risking their own lives. If you dont want them to do their job, stop giving them attention. Eventually if everyone turns their back we will all be ignorant POS and they'll be out of a job. Who wins then?

WowThinking about the sheer size of Andromeda and how big it looks in our sky is kinda terrifying. It really creeps me out.Way back in the day (late 70s) I took an Astronomy course in college. Once a week we went out of town to an abandon military base that had six rather large telescopes (I am talking 1 meter collection mirror at bottom). I saw my first galaxy, and it blew me away, realizing what I was looking at. You can buy a cheap telescope and see Saturn. Now Saturn! When you see that thing, with the rings? You turn to star dust.Man I wanna be a damn astronaut If we could just get rid of all the light pollution from that pesky Milky Way, then we'd be in business...What would the night sky look like if the same treatment was applied to other ""close-enough-to-be-visible"" galaxies?[Here](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130801.html)'s NASA's version of the same thing.I WISH this was actually real. 

Real as in that being actually brighter for all to see.I'll begin work on a 30 point plan to brighten that galaxy. It must be done. Late to the party, but just to add a little something to the discussion:

If a star were the size of a marble, the closest one (Proxima Centauri) to your marble (the sun) would be in your friend's house a few KM down the road. If our galaxy were a dinner plate, however, your wife's dinner plate (Andromeda) would be right across the table from you.

In short, by their relative size, galaxies are much closer together than stars.This is the reason why our telescopes etc. can see galaxies millions of light years away but can't see the moon landing sites: galaxies are fucking huge. http://youtu.be/7uiv6tKtoKg?t=2m55sLove that the moon has provided a banana for scale as well. Good Guy Moon.Space is probably the most wondrous thing ever. Just looking up at the night sky, seeing Mars and Venus blinking indiscriminately, blows my mind and sometimes, I wish we lived in a time where space travel is a daily and normal thing. Where we lived side-by-side with other species. I wonder how much it would've affected the human psyche to have that in the sky.Great pic!I read that as ""if it were bigger"" first.

No, that isn't me being a smart ass. I'm jealous. I'll never forget when I went snowboarding for the first time and I was waiting for my family to get down from a slope. Before they got down, several guys came screaming down (not sloppy though) and stopped fairly close to me and I saw he had his phone out when he was coming down and stopped.

I can't even go down a flipping bunny hill without falling and this guy goes down one of the crazy slopes with his phone out in front of him the entire way.

What. a. jerk.

An awesome jerk at that though.

PS: He wasn't really a jerk. We shared some good laughs as I asked him about how difficult it was to do that.This here is a top quality submission, thanks OP.It looks like a trail of sparks leading up to a ball of flame truly spectacularI'm sure glad you took the time to post this...This is one of the few instances where the thumbnail looks cooler than the enlarged picture.

Anyone have a second photo of this example?  It looks too perfect, and I'm sure such a good work of art would have lots of people taking pictures of it.

I think that there are a growing number of false images that are simply composites in the computer.  The super-brilliant whites and subtle shading, and the complete lack of road texture, leads me to think this is a fake.  There are no objects on the road near the edges, no shadows falling near it, no alternate viewpoint to show the way that the projection depends on a certain view angle.  In short, nothing that proves this is a chalk art on the surface of the road.

**Edit:**  This is apparently a *draft* of a *concept* by Edgar Mueller, and is in fact a composite in the computer.

I feel for you in this tragedy.When I went to help after the Joplin tornado I couldn't believe the stuff like this I saw. Houses destroyed with a coffee table and glasses untouched in the living room, a closet with clothes hanging in it, and I remember the second floor of an apartment complex that had a dresser sitting against what used to be a wall. There wasn't even a second floor anywhere else nearby. Oh yeah, and two-by-fours stuck through everything, walls, concrete, trees... It was the most awful and amazing thing I've ever seen. This is what I love about tornadoes. Sure they're scary and destructive, but sometimes they get bored and pull the most random pranks. It's like a huge guy walking up to you in a dark alley and booping your nose.[deleted]This is why in hurricane prone areas they are now having to actually *attach the roof to the house* instead of just sitting the frame pieces on top of the wall framing.

Prior to the storm there was an old water pump that was about four feet tall and about three feet outside the barn.  Afterwards we want out to check for damage and everything looked fine at first glance.

Then we saw that the water pump was now inside the barn. The wind picked up a 3 story barn at least four feet of the ground and moved it over the pump. That is pretty crazy to try and picture, and scary.Serious question - how do they fix this now? Not the curtain, but do they just re-bolt the roof back on, or does it have to be taken apart and re-built? I'd assume there must be more structural damage than you could see.I guess the Tornado had a change of heart[I wish I could be a successful karma whore like re-OP](http://karmadecay.com/r/WTF/comments/1r0axr/tornado_blew_the_roof_up_the_curtain_blew_outside/)That's mildly interesting as fuck","{'Sadness': 0.058759, 'Anger': 0.941238, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Emotional_Range': 0.811, 'Tentative': 0.824, 'Joy': 0.036447, 'Disgust': 0.496877, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.093, 'Fear': 0.826143, 'Openness': 0.318, 'Extraversion': 0.615, 'Agreeableness': 0.51}"

All of a sudden the landscape would change and I'd be enveloped in a warm red glow on a cold winter night. That was an awesome feeling.Why are the yellow and green lights shining at the same time?
Is this a long exposure photo? Because all the lights are on at once.I should also point out that since this is Germany. The yellow light also comes on red to green.

How to colorize a photo 1-min-tutorial: 

1. Photoshop

2. Original BW photo in bottom.

3. Create one new layer, set to Color Mode, for every object. Your brush should also be in Color mode. I personally don't use adjustment layers, everyone else seems to be using it though. Whatever works for you!It's always amazing to see pictures from almost 100 years ago that have people looking like normal people.  Most of us will always picture the past with people either looking completely different from us, or modernized.  But these guys are clearly from that era, yet also clearly normal humans.

Not sure if that made sense.  Anyway, nice job on the colorizing!

Edit: People are being silly.  ""Normal Human Beings?  What else would they be?"" and so on.  I just meant that, thanks to Hollywood, I always picture people of this era (or any era) in B&W, or down on their luck, poor, filthy, unshaven, unkempt, or rich, fat with food, healthy, glowing, beautiful, etc.  I just thought it was cool that these guys, with a different backdrop, different car, and different clothes, would look almost the same today as they did back then.  Just an observation.I'm glad to see that DC residents' inability to drive in snow has such deep roots in history.Most colorizations just fell ""off"" to me, but this looks real, awesome job. 

Could you perchance share the original? I am always entertained by the comparison. Anybody else wondering why the front left tire doesn't have chains on it like the other visible tires?jokester still in the car

I'm wishing I could do this good.My lucky stars! A negro!Guy in the driver's seat is all Urkel ""Did I do thaaaaat?""Very nice work. Did you purposely leave that section of street/trees trailing into the background b&w or am I imagining that? \*oblig Maryland driver joke here*Has anyone else noticed that the right front wheel has no snow chains?Great job!  Its truly amazing where automotive tech has gone.  Those tires look absolutely useless, hence the fact that they were driving on chains when it wasn't even snowy out.Colorized photos always kind of wig me out, because they remind me that people in black and white type photos were just as real and human as we are now. I know it sounds weird, if that makes sense.This is by **FAR** the best colorization I have ever seen. It's gotten to the point where I didn't actually think it was originally black-and-white.

 No Water, No Moon

When the nun Chiyono studied Zen under Bukko of Engaku she was unable to attain the fruits of meditation for a long time.

At last one moonlit night she was carrying water in an old pail bound with bamboo. The bamboo broke and the bottom fell out of the pail, and at that moment Chiyono was set free!

In commemoration, she wrote a poem:

    In this way and that I tried to save the old pail
    Since the bamboo strip was weakening and about
       to break
    Until at last the bottom fell out.
    No more water in the pail!
    No more moon in the water!

Deer at least look in your direction as you are driving toward them and you can see the eye shine. Moose, on the other hand, don't give a flying fuck, and look in whatever direction they feel like with no care whatsoever as to what is coming, and you normally  can't see them until it's too late.

I was with friends one night cruising a back country road at speeds near 70. I just happened to see what looked like people standing in the middle of the road aways ahead. I told the driver to slow down, and luckily he did. At 45 we just could make out the outline of a moose. The driver slammed on the brakes and we came to a stop inches from it. The moose actually sniffed at the hood emblem on the car and then slowly meandered off.

It is important to note that I have phenomenal vision.

Not a huge factor. They were probably just about to sit down for dinner.I lived in Santiago for a month last year, it is such a close knit community. Everybody cares immensely for everybody else.Spaniard here.

I was watching Game of Thrones on national television when a crawling ticket announced that after the episode there would be a breaking news cast and to hold on to screen. Funny thing, it was the only channel actually doing it. The rest of cheap bastards were on regular programming.

Believe it or not, we're not some bunch of lazy uneducated people. You say in national news we need blood, we go. 2 am for summer is nothing. Young people might be in the streets, old people might be chilling and playing cards. - and watching the newscast.

I have 5 donations on my blood donor card, and stopped donating a couple years ago because I was too tired with studying and needed my red globe account up and running. When they said they needed blood I thought, 'It was less that 100km from here, I already on my way to donor center, which is like 15' from here.

Red Cross is ALWAYS in buses in the main squares, university and public building halls, etc, asking for blood. They make seasonal rallies in specific places a lot of people goes. Blood is not only for big accidents and the weekly car accident death peaks, but for op room and treatments aswell. A friend's grandfather is on weekly blood transfusions at home (he doesn't pay with cash his treatment btw, is funded by taxpayers). Red Cross Spain is the source of blood for the national health system, and they simply need it.
When they said 'we need blood' was more like 'we need it right fucking now, not when an ambulance comes from hell away with it'.

When the newscast started, it was 35 confirmed deaths, when I went to sleep 45. Now it's 79 and counting, with 36 in the blade of the knife. It means they were not only taking bodies out; people was dying too. They simply *needed* the blood.

Btw, we make fun of stereotypes as much as the next guy - if not even more. But,

Siesta is a thing agriculture labour did after the lunch when the sun was at peak hours and it was impossible to work and there was no TV. We all kind of still do when we're on villages on holiday and stuff like that. Kids do it too.
But siesta just means nap, and we take them as much or less as anywhere else in the world.

I haven't slept siesta since I was a kid and I don't anyone who does, aside for the occasional nap, that I will take at any time if I'm exhausted no matter what time is it.

It's 36º C today and I won't hit the streets again until 7pm or so, when it's stops being so damn wet hot outside.
I barely have breakfast, I eat my break food at 11 or 12, have lunch at 14.30, eat something throu the afternoon/evening, and have dinner at 22 or even 23. I can't sleep before 00 ever, and in work days I get up at 6.30am. Most of us are seriously under-slept. Lunch and dinner are our big meals.
And yup, I'm up at 2am lotsa times. In fact last night, I followed the accident until 4am.

Our lifestyle has nothing to do with siesta. We have different commercial daylight timing, different meal hours and a different set of habits altogether. [Spain has the highest organ donation rate in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation), too.As someone from Galicia, 40 minutes from where the accident occurred, this makes me very proud. So sad how this happened the night before Galicia's biggest day, the celebration of St. James the Apostle. Prayers for lost ones.

Ánimo GaliciaIt is also being reported that people with minor injuries are freeing their beds at the hospital so that they can be used by those who need it the most.Wow, that's incredible. Good job there fellow citizens.The maximum speed for that turn is 50mph (80kmph). It appears the two train conductors were going way faster than that. Sad, really.

I heard that their pay is docked if they arrive late; does anyone know if this is even remotely true?That's really cool. Looks like a goddamn harry potter book release vigil. Wishing the best for the victims.I fucking love people.“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ""Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” - Mr. RogersSo scary, my girlfriend was on that train, but got off on a stop just before this. Fate is funny sometimes.I donate blood every 8 weeks because people still get hurt and need blood even when there isn't a bad accident.  Spain is good for not just blood donations- it also has the highest rate of organ donation in the world, because they work on a ""presumed consent"" system.As a Gallego living in the UK, this photo gives me lots of morriña. solidariedade coas vítimas e xente do santiago.

so... as a danish donor all i can do is look at this as a futile gesture. the blood wouldn't be used for at least two months, as it has to be checked for disease before being used. 

of course i have no way to know if this is the way its done in Spain, or if its an exception because of the emergency. all i can hope is that they had enough regular donors beforehand to ensure that they could help immediately. My girlfriends parents were traveling by train and we haven't heard from them since yesterday. US Embassy can't yet release a list so were having to play the sit and wait game. I'm extremely scared. 

Edit: thanks guys y'all got me in tears over here. Makes me happy to know there's still good, friendly people left in this world. 

Edit 2: thanks to all the people who reached out for the information to make the call for me, their names aren't on any list yet and so were hoping that theyre just out enjoying their time. As soon as I find out more ill come back and update again. 

Edit 3: she's finally spoken to them at their hotel, they had been traveling by train for the majority of their trip, they decided to fly from where they were back to Spain. For those who helped and offered to help, thanks so much, you have us a great sense of relief. For those who don't ""like"" me because of reddit comments, sorry I'm not sorry I hurt your feelings. That's nice to see. I recently needed blood during childbirth, would have died without it. Sadly I can	't donate myself but I truly appreciate those who can and doI was just in Santiago de Compostelanon the Camino. The people are truly some of the most generous I've ever met. Bloody awesome guys!

This wouldn't help anyone determine whether there are good or bad books in here. > Do you judge a book by it's cover?

No, but I do judge a bookstore by its grammar.Two things:

1. The expression to ""not judge a book by its cover"" means, rather than purchase a book *almost* blindly, open it up and skim it. Packaged as such, this is not possible for these books.

2. I would never pay [$12.95 to buy a book of which I didn't know the title](http://i.imgur.com/h5UhmJ2.png). The only reason people buy unknown goods on the internet is because they are usually very cheap (e.g. Woot sales); $12.95 for a book is full price for most Amazon books.

EDIT: Replaced ""peruse"" with ""skim"". I LEARNED A NEW WORD TODAY!It's very sensible to judge a book by its cover, bad books have usually have bad covers. Psh, not at $12.95.Is that at Elizabeth's book shop at Newtown (Australia)??? I love this idea... but those better be Latvian dollars or something. I'd buy a 1 or 2 dollar mystery book, maaaaaybe a 5 dollar one, but does that really say it's $17.95? That's the full price, and I don't even get to read the back cover synopsis? For all I know, the thing is old newspapers, or worse, a terrible novel I don't want to read.

Is there a return policy or perhaps some sort of satisfaction guarantee? I'd give it a whirl if I could be sure I could enjoy the book, but I've read books I've been given for free and wished I could return them for the time invested. I'd hate to pay 20 bucks and end up with a stinker like one of them. A bookstore that misuses ""its.""

I was way up in Northern Wisconsin and there were two of them perched on a dead deer just eating the shit out of it. It was pretty awesome.

The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you. So you know, try to show a little respect. Did you know?

While human hands are open when relaxed and takes effort to close, eagles are the opposite. Their muscles are relaxed when closed and requires effort to open.Holy fuck. What type of eagle?A few hundred years back, falconry was actually eaglery, where hunters trained eagles to hunt for prey. But, every now and then, the eagle would get pissy, and kill their handler, usually by sinking their massive talons into their skulls until they died. Kinda put a damper on the fun. So they got smaller birds, and it was all like, party on Wayne. Damn Dinosaurs!

The sound side got it the worst. A few restaurants lost parking lots and quite a few shops were closed. The amount of debris piled up on the side of the road was mind blowing.

People forget it's just one giant sand bar that does move and eventually will no longer be there. (Granted some parts are trying to do beach restoration.)nice!  We stay in extreme S. Nags Head for a week every summer, like 1/4 mile before it turns into the Pea Island preserve and we often spend another few days or week down at a friend's place in Avon.  LUCKILY we got off the island (around Thanksgiving) before they closed the effing Bonner bridge.  What are your thoughts on all that BS?

Do you think the SELC is a bunch of a-holes keeping the new bridge from being built or do you think the long bridge is actually in any way feasible?  I feel awful for all of the permanent and vacation homeowners and businesses down there, what a bunch of bullshit.

More pictures and information about this dive can be found [here](http://www.tourismontheedge.com/extreme/diving-in-the-tectonic-plate-gap-between-europe-and-america.html).

Also, it should be pointed out that tectonics are more of a zonal thing. You can't necessarily say that the rocks on the left belong to the North American plate, while the rocks on the right belong to the Eurasian plate. The geologic processes that are occurring in the area are creating these valleys and canyons, but it is more of a fuzzy divide instead of a sharp clear one that the pictures make it out to be.

^^^Courtesy ^^^of ^^^[purple_people_eaters](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/19iu76/diver_swimming_between_tectonic_plates/c8ofj4s)What did one tectonic plate say when he bumped into the other?

Not above or around, THROUGH it.I've done this, and it was one of the cooler experiences of my life. If you ever get to Reykjavik, check it out.  Every time you open your mouth, it's like drinking Evian.

Edit:  I had to wear a super heavy duty waterproof suit.  It was awesome to walk through the snow, and walk into the water.  Each time I came to the surface, light snowflakes hit my nose. I snorkeled, but you can scuba. You only go about 20ft lower in scuba.  

In Reykjavik, there are people who offer this.  It's about a 1 hour drive from the city.  I was there last summer, really beautiful landscape.

Here's a few pictures I took.

*Thousands of years later...*

:""Damn! Missed!""Fun fact, the season premiere of Game of Thrones that just aired had a scene that was filmed at this location. Not in the water obviously but at a different part of the same plate boundary a few minutes away. I was there a few days before they started filming. The water is insanely clear and blue, even more so than this picture lets on. 

This area was apparently the site of the rudiments of an ancient viking parliament too. The different viking crews would all meet there periodically to discuss viking shit. Shit's pretty magical.Here it is from a helicopter: 

http://web.stagram.com/p/560373124920864169_19586370 

The cracks go as deep as 197 feet. FYI these are not literally the tectonic plates. This is a valley created by the movement of the plates. The frontier of the plates are indeed there, but kilometers deeper.

No one will ever be able to be actually between tectonic plates. They float in fucking magma.Oh!!!! I was just there in March! I went dry suit snorkeling in the same area. It was an incredible experience.  

The water comes from Langjökull Glacier, the 2nd largest glacier in Iceland.  The glacier water is roughly 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) all the time and the water is so clear that you have 120 meters (393.7 feet) of vision all around you.  Also the water gets completely filtered through by volcanic rocks so it is safe to drink it and the guide told us to feel free to drink it, which I did and it was the most delicious water I've ever had.

For those of you who are curious as to what dry suit snorkeling is, you essentially wear a huge down feather body suit under a latex outer layer suit. There is tight latex around your wrists and neck (a little uncomfortable for those of you who have claustrophobia) and it keeps you completely dry.  You then get wet suit gloves and a head/face mask to keep the exposed parts of your body warm.  You are completely buoyant and pretty much float on the surface of the water without any effort.

TL DR: Iceland is an amazing place with incredible people, food, and nature. If you get the opportunity to go... DO IT, especially if you love the outdoors... and bring a Go Pro camera!I bet he's wet his pants because he is suffering from ""incontinents""  Iceland is an amazing place to visit. If you're not into diving you can go to a place where you can touch the North American tectonic plate and the European tectonic plate with your own wee hands.I've been there!

[I took this photo on a bridge.](https://i.imgur.com/QYtv6JP.jpg) The rocks to the right are the European plate and to the left is the American plate. We went on the glacier in the background after too.Who is going to make the gif of the plates *crushing him?*Serious question - Say, if the tectonic plates now had a sudden movement, would the diver go deaf? I immagine it being loud.[Donkey Kong IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH-UGtfGH8I#t=24)Dat basalt.[Here is a better link about it from an Iceland dive shop.](http://www.dive.is/dive-sites/silfra/)   I'm not at home or I'd post my own pictures from the trip.

I did this dive when I visited Iceland back in April 2012.  The water is only a sliver above freezing and it requires a dry suit which my body proportions (read that as: fatty) didn't like.  

The most amazing thing about it is the clarity of the water.  Normally when you SCUBA dive good visibility is 40-60 feet at best.  In this canyon, Silfra, and the lagoon it feeds into, the water is so clean and clear visibility is hundreds of feet.  The water that comes into this underwater rift valley comes directly from glaciers through volcanic rock and there is a slight current down the valley that slowly carries you along.  The water is so clean you can just drink it without any hazard.  I remember taking one big swallow and it was the cleanest water I've ever tasted.

The link posted by /u/Spartan2470/ gives a bit of a false impression of the place (not Spartan's fault).  The link says ""Saying this place is not tourist-friendly would be an understatement.""  This is just plain wrong.  It's not dangerous at all and there are no hot springs in this canyon, nor is it tectonically unstable.  You don't even need to scuba to experience it, you can snorkel instead.  You only need to wear a dry suit because the water is so cold.

In order to do the SCUBA you need a basic Open Water Certification.  You don't need to already have dry suit experience, they'll teach you the dry suit basics you'll need.  

When I did it, it was a half day experience from Reykjavik and cost about $250-$300 to do SCUBA.  It's less for snorkeling, obviously.

**TL;DR:** Amazing half day diving experience from Reykjavik that anyone can do.

Edit:  May king my English gooder then it were bee four.ITT: People with very little knowledge of tectonic plates. I wish people would stop referring to this picture as two "" tectonic plates"" because that is NOT what this is. This definitely should not make me nervous, but it does.As crazy as this looks, I did this with my 12 year old (but snorkeling, not scuba) last Summer.  Iceland is the most insanely tourist-friendly country.  It was a little advanced for her but her suit leaked (just above freezing) and she was such a good sport about it.   Also, with snorkeling you can see the bottom really easily.  Super super clear water.For those curious, this is actually a divergent plate boundary; as the plates moved, this gap widens. A diver would probably never notice a change as they moved","{'Sadness': 0.040447, 'Anger': 0.816976, 'Analytical': 0.286, 'Emotional_Range': 0.579, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Joy': 0.062377, 'Disgust': 0.066022, 'Confident': 0.248, 'Conscientiousness': 0.292, 'Fear': 0.263996, 'Openness': 0.405, 'Extraversion': 0.593, 'Agreeableness': 0.498}"

This will be on those ""2014 in Photographs"", right?Damn what a mess, being manipulated by two major powers with an economy going to hell and a government out to get them. 

I really do hope these protesters can convince those in power that these new draconian laws only serve to harm them in the long run. No Jokes. Just wanted to comment that this picture is extremely powerful and personally moving.During the US Civil War there was a priest name Father Corby. Just before two opposing Irish regiments faced one another, Father Corby stood on top of a rock and gave absolution to all there. Both sides knelt down & accepted his blessing. Then went on to brutally kill one another. This reminded me of that event, except here the priest is trying to stop the deaths from happening. *Edit: Colby to CorbyYou can see the fear and sincerity in this mans eyes.  That brave, poor man.To the morons criticizing the priest for not facing the cops or for somehow stopping the protesters ""fighting for their rights:"" 

The last thing Ukraine needs right now is bloodshed. You think all those protesters are united behind one single, pro-rights related idea? The political situation in Ukraine is much more complex than it seems through images alone. Along with people who are rioting against the government are, for example, Svoboda and other fascist/neo-nazi groups that are trying to take advantage of the chaos. 

Revolution should be the very last option, as it often just replaces one form of tyranny for another.

The fire's far enough from the from of the shelter to not catch it on fire but close enough for it to catch some of the heat.

Just imagine how terrifying it would be to get lost in the forest and stumble upon two eyes peering out from the middle of that giant leaf monster's mouth. 

edit: fixed ""looking peering out""Former Wilderness Survival instructor here: 
Great looking shelter, looks to be wind resistant and good enough to keep out a majority of water.  The fire is a little close, but not dangerously close, and judging by the darker look of the ground and leaves it looks to be rather damp, although I would have preferred to see the fire ringed or pitted a few inches.  All in all that is a solid survival camp and he is definitely going to need to check for ticks in the morning (spiders don't move in for a few days).Triforces are the best kind of shelter. [Woops...](http://i.imgur.com/RUrmfjL.jpg)Looks flammable... Seems like a good idea, building a fire next to your hut of dry leaves and branches. &#3232;_&#3232;ITT: armchair survivalists.

Look at all them dry leaves that could go up quick.That looks like a very flammable shelter...that fire is awfully close to his shelter made of kindling I made a survival hut (which is what this is called) on top of the Santa Rosa Mountain in SoCal, went back 4 years later while it was 30 degrees and snowing and it was still there! Needless to say it saved my ass on searching for fire wood.Ho, ho, ho Solo.Dry leaves + Fire...I find this oddly arousing...I've built and slept in a shelter of that design. The thing that got me was how *quiet* it was compared to a tent. I slept so well.nice debry shelter! super fun and surprising warm and dry, my only preference is for a smaller entrance! <sniffing>The roof.... <sniff> the roof... <sniffing> the roof is on FIRE!!!!!!!He'll burn as a pile of leaves would.Where can I learn survival techniques like this?That is just a bonfire waiting to happen.There is some awesome 3D triforce going on in this pictureI remember building tents like this (although not as fancy) when I was a kid.

The chicken coop, with all its varied and unique fowl, was of particular interest to my four year old and as such, we were all tied to it for several minutes. After staring at one particular hen, my son noticed she had an egg underneath. 

Some other kids had purchased feed from one of the bubblegum-style machines scattered throughout the park and were feeding the chickens on the other side of the enclosure. All of the hens rushed to the feed, the one who caught my son's eye included. Suddenly, a large, splendid rooster came strutting over to where the hen had been guarding her egg. He inspected it for a moment, cocking his head from side to side, meaty waddle flopping back and forth, and proceeded to peck the egg until it cracked. 

Bloody yolk spilled out and the rooster ate from the massacred ovum. His fervor attracted other hens who were too late to the feeding on the other side of the enclosure and soon there was an all-out egg feast. I was in shock, jaw agape, untilI heard my son sniffing quietly.

""He killed the baby."" he said to me, tears rolling down his cheeks. ""Why'd he do that, daddy?""

I had no reply but to gently squeeze his shoulder, turn him from the frenzied fowl, and lead him to another area of the park. Several quarters worth of pellet-feed and aggressive sheep visits later, he seemed none the worse for wear.

I know how it happened (ball got wedged in the V of the tree sometime in the past),  I know why it happened (trees grow) but now I wanna play detective (work out when it got stuck there) because it actually looks like a ""vintage"" golfball (from the late 80s) looking at the pink / blue core....at least thats the last time I saw that sort of center to a golfball.

Any hoo....Any idea how old the golf course you where working on is? Or is near to where you are working? If it has been around since the 80s (or longer) then it could well have sat in that tree for sometime before the tree started to grow around it.

They are just trying to help out with the bills or get a little extra money to do things with the kids.

Harbor Freight hell yah.I've seen Etsy advertisers before on Reddit, but this takes the game to a whole new level. It would be incredibly easy for the Etsy shop in question to simply write a note, put a necklace round it, photograph it and reap a massive profit increase due to the Reddit popularity surge.

This may well be a completely honest post, but it would be so, so easy for this to be faked and there is a huge motive to do so.

If you *hadn't* mentioned the shop name, that would be a different matter.It took me a long time to realize that that isn't a spinner bait.
Wow, someone on Etsy actually makes their own jewelry... I thought it was all relabeled Chinese stuff.Nice try Simple Diversions!I bought my sister a necklace on etsy from a girl I kinda-sorta knew from my hometown. I had her send it as an anonymous gift but included a message. 

Well, she wrote the message by hand, so my sister got a necklace in the mail from a stranger, obviously a woman, telling her she hoped she liked the gift and that if she thought it was tacky, to give it to her daughter (called the 3 year old daughter by name). 

I never could have planned how hilarious that turned out: I completely forgot I sent it bc I did it online. A couple of months later I called my sister and happened to remember the necklace I sent her. She freaked out, she was like, ""That was you?! I was so creeped out! Some chick I didn't know sent me jewelry, knew who my daughter was, and I had no idea who she was!"" My sister got the gift, read the note, and was so creeped out she didn't even Facebook stalk her, just threw the whole package into a drawer. She said she was super bummed because she loved the necklace and wanted to wear it, but she didn't want to be seen by some sicko stalker wearing this thing. 

Wow. So that's the story of the time my sister kept her shades drawn for two months and lay awake at night wondering who had her address and names of her family members.

I just recently started painting because I've always enjoyed art, and my wife turned one of our rooms into a studio for my hobby to help my cope with my depression, etc. My first painting was something a friend had commissioned: [masturbating robot 2x2](http://i.imgur.com/5VxUGeL.jpg)Where's the friendly cabin?

This is similar to the program that fills water tanks in sparse areas around the US-Mexico border to aide immigrants or hikers that get lost.

Love you guys.

Sincerely,

A guy from Washington state who married a Canadian.When I was in Ottawa during winter many years ago, I had lost my gloves. A random stranger noticed I wasn't wearing any, opened up his backpack and took out another pair, took off the warmed up ones he was wearing and gave them to me, putting on the colder ones himself. One of the nicest things I have ever had happen to me.Ottawa resident here, shit's cold. Ottawa's really pretty at night.im from ottawa and i approve this message The other half better be in French.

I miss Ontario and its nice people and its colorful money.This is a cool gesture. You can tell someone spent alot of time hand knitting these, which I think make is more special.FUCK YEA OTTAWA REPRESENTAll I can think of is Hermione Granger and house elves. Holy shit. Back in the fall of 2008 when I was on a work term in Ottawa, their bus transit workers went on strike, forcing me to walk 25 minutes to work every day in absolutely bitter conditions. There were times when my knees would get so cold that they would lock up and I would have to duck into an alcove or doorway just to get out of the wind and give them some relief. Anyways, one blustery morning en route to work, an older woman stopped me in my tracks, reached into a tote bag, pulled out this multi-coloured knitted scarf, and handed it to me. Initially I was hesitant as the streets of downtown Ottawa have a lot of homeless people who are not shy of accosting you on the way to work. I told her I did not have any money, but she simply winked at me and continued on down the road. I often re-visit that moment when I'm thinking selfishly. You hear of random acts of kindness all the time but when something like that happens to you it has a profound and lasting impact. I like to think that same lady is the one who is leaving scarfs all around Ottawa in the OP. I hope it brings her much joy.

Tl;dr Lived in Ottawa for four months from Sept-Dec 2008. Transit workers went on strike, forcing many to walk to work in subzero temps. Older lady randomly stopped me and gave me a scarf. This article makes me like to think she's still out there.Ottawa on the front page for the second time in 2014, this was a good year already!/r/ottawa would love this!Haha right on. I saw these while walking home today. Thought it was weird that all the busts had them.

Water: For Clarity
Do you know how fucking awesome and sad Manatees are?! 

They have no natural predators, so they're not afraid of anything. Problem is: **They're so in need of physical and social stimuli, they can literally die from it**. So they seek humans out, just to be petted and bellyrubbed. Problem is they sometimes get hit by boats/propellers because as I said; They know no fear.
So you have these scarred, battered manatees... Searching for boats and humans to pet them, even if it would mean death to get run over. Because they crave the hugs that badly.

**EDIT** As some people are stating, this does not apply to all manatee species. There are those who do have predators (sharks). As with most animals, you should not pet them etc. (even if they crave it) because it's not good for their behavior. I am not a marine biologist so do not take my word as law. Just remember that manatees are fucking awesome and hugeable. I just moved to FL and I'm definitely adding this to my list of things to do! Hypothetically, if you just jumped in the water and started swimming with them, would there even be any danger? Not that I'm you know...planning anything...The world is a beautiful place.See?  Florida's not so bad!  See?My aunt and uncle live right by there, we went 2 years ago.  Sadly they weren't around that time of year.  However when you go down a little bit further there is a public swimming area.  It is insanely clear because of the huge underground water source.  You can snorkel or scuba way down into this thing.  I borrowed someones goggles and floated over the top looking down and actually got freaked out.   My Aunt is lucky enough to work with Save The Manatee for a living. As a kid in the 80's, (it may have been illegal even then, but wasn't quite as conspicuous) she took us to meet some manatees that she had been tracking. They were hanging out around the outflow of a power plant because the warm water that ran out of the power plant as waste made the water warmer and also helped keep a nice mushy area in the grass that they like to eat, so it was a pretty good setup for them at the time. 

We got in the water with them and fed them heads of iceberg lettuce. They really do love being petted. They will anchor themselves to you by grabbing your legs with their little t-rex flippers so they don't float away from the petting and the lettuce. Their squishy, whiskery noses are the best.


 It's great to see people caring and being aware of what's going on with them. There's only about 5,000 Florida Manatees left. 803 of them, 16% of the recorded population, died in 2013. It's going to take effort and awareness to keep them around. Look at that Spanish Moss! And those palms! Florida is so fucking beautiful. 

Whenever anyone asks ""How can you like a state that is 95% swamp land and *gasps* totally flat?"". I chuckle a little and shrug my shoulders in agreement. What I'm really thinking of is *THIS*. Also got to see 300 manatees today. Walmart.""Barbara Manatee! Manatee! Manatee! You are the one for me,one for me,one for me! Sent from up above,up above,up above-you are the ONE I LOVE!"" hell yeah. fuckin manatees.Hey I was there just yesterday! Pretty cool to see something on the front page that close to home.When I was only twelve or so I got a horrible sunburn chasing the ice cream truck down the beach (elusive bastard). Because this my parents figured Blue Springs was the perfect spot to heal. We went on a two hour boat ride to try and see a manatee (this was during summer, not really their time to hang out in the springs) and we saw nothing. Five minutes before we were supposed to get out a manatee swam right under me headed towards the spring head. 

10/10 would swim againLucky bastard.more pictures from Orlando Sentinel:

Official count inside the sanctuary was 292. The park is very strict and you cannot get in the water except in the summer when the managers are not there. There are heavy fines for interacting with them. My boyfriend and I traveled to Florida over the holiday and swam with them -- something that has been on my bucket list for a long time. It was a powerful experience. The babies in particular are very curious and come right up to you. I've always been skeptical of that ""eyes are the windows to the soul"" saying but....looking right into their eyes is mind-blowing. 

We took video of our experience; it's pretty cool: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF45ANvEhNE&feature=em-upload_ownerI went swimming with the manatees about one month ago, and it was amazing.  I was shocked about how big they are.  I was told that full-grown manatees weigh about 1,200 pounds (or a little under 550 kg), but I did not appreciate their size until I got up close.  They were like the size of a refrigerator and a half.

At first, I was hesitant to touch them because it is against the law, but they starting coming up to me, so I could pet them.  The manatees would bend their flippers and then roll over on their stomachs, so they could be scratched.  These fuckers loved having their stomachs scratched more than anything.

A couple manatees even bumped into me.  It did not hurt at all because they move so slow.  

I highly recommend doing this.  They are in the Crystal River and the Homosassa River in December and January because that water stays 72^o F (22^o C) and the Gulf of Mexico is too cold.  It is only like an hour and a half from Orlando.  So, if you can drive down there in the next few weeks, then you should absolutely do it before the manatees return to the gulf.  To anyone who wants to go to Disney World, take this shit on to your itinerary because I guarantee it will be the highlight of your trip.

It is usually about $40-$60 per person to have a boat take you out there for a while, and they outfit you with equipment.  Getting a full wetsuit is nice because you never get cold, and it keeps you afloat.

Uh yeah, it is so cool.  You guys should swim with the manatees.I live in High Springs, which is 15 minutes away from Blue Springs. I love this area. In my opinion this is the best place in Florida300 you say?

https://www.google.com/search?q=discreetPeople keep asking how these footprints ended up sideways. I will do my best as a geology student to explain.

The prints were originally imprinted in a muddy or clay bed which then is lithified (geology term for cemented together and made into rock) into one big sheet. Now, odds are that in the millions of years between in which the continents spread and moved to where it is now, it was buried, probably lithified again into more rock, with a fault where the surface was, and shifted into its current position. How it got there is really hard to tell, and it could happened in a huge number of ways. An earthquake possibly, but more likely erosion.

Then some men in Bolivia dug it up.

Hope this helps.

Not directly related but sure as hell reminded me of that.Winter is coming.....This rock is at this angle now because the area is part of the Andes mountain range system. The mountains are created by magma rising up though the continental plate (south America). The magma is created by the oceanic plate to the west (pacific ocean sea bed) subducting beneath and melting below the continental plate. The magma is more buoyant than the surrounding mantle so rise up and melts some of the mantle/continental crust on the way - volcanoes.

Earthquakes do happen but they are more where the oceanic plate it subducting so dont have as much of an effect on tilting rock like this. Its at this angle because of the folding/bending/deformation of the surrounding rock while the magma rises through it.

http://i.imgur.com/Q9n9t0m.jpgOn a commercial flight from IL to Canada back in 09 (on my way to AK) we spotted a B-2 headed in the opposite direction while navigating some clouds. It was pretty damn close and banking hard. I'll never forget seeing that thing. When you see it in person it's hard to grasp how it works. Technology is awesome. All I see are a couple of weather balloons. My aunt sent me this picture yesterday. My cousin was flying the fuel plane:

http://imgur.com/FegwxYEFTFY: http://imgur.com/D5JMcbS

Nothing to see here. Carry on.I guess you'd call that a photo-bomber. Notice how the B-2 isn't forming any exhaust contrails while the other aircraft is leaving behind a highly visible contrail from each of its 4 engines. This would give away its position. 

The B-2 can form contrails if the conditions are right, but I'm sure a hell of a lot of engineering went into making sure that this rarely happens.

its like seeing a Ninja in the wild....Where the hell are you?!

http://imgur.com/mFzopNsAirman here, I correctly guessed you lived somewhere in Missouri, those B-2s are stationed out there. The aircraft refueling it is a KC-135 Stratotanker. Pretty common practice but not always visible from the ground so great shot! 
The B-2 is probably on some training mission as pilots need to keep their certifications up frequently, or better yet met be training how to refuel aerially. I don't know whether it's the perspective but I never knew the Stealth Bombers were that big.I love how stealth bombers look like they were photoshopped into real life.Takes me back to Top Gun on NES.

SPEED UP SPEED UP

DOWN DOWNI lived in Missouri near Whiteman AFB.  The stealth bombers flew out of there.  It was always strange to see those things flying so up close. I think the Apache and the Chinook helicopters flew out of there, too.

Also, heard lots of funny and/or cool stories coming out of that area.  

The local BSA troop had connections with Whiteman and got to play after hours in the flight simulators for the Apache.  I was wishing I was a BSA leader that day.

Lots of hunting in MO.  There was a hunter sitting in a patch of brush and trees in the middle of a farmers field.  The Apaches were doing a trial run and the coordinates they were given was that patch of brush and trees.  They flew to the patch and surrounded it, facing inwards, while holding position.  The hunter freaked out, dropped his rifle, and slowly stood up, with his hands up.  He slowly walked out and surrendered.  

Not sure if his pants were clean after that encounter.
Funny thing is OP lives in North KoreaStealth plane, my ass. I can see it right there!

EDIT: wowee, I got gold for this. Thank you, fellow redditor! I finally feel ready to buy that velvet jacket I've been eyeing. Seriously though, much appreciated.

Also, I know stealth planes aren't supposed to be invisible to the eye; twas a silly joke.Oh yeah, I go bird watching with my camera all the time too, it's really convenient because there is a great nesting spot next to a yoga place with huge front glass windows.This is basically the beginning to the movie Executive Decision.B2 Spirit stealth bomber and a KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft.

The KC-135 airframe is *derived* from the old Boeing 707. It has received many advancements over the years. Many of the KCs I have been in were introduced in the 60s and are still in service. The view you get from the boom operator's seat is phenomenal! Can see straight down! I never had the chance to sit and watch an actual air refuel.

FWIW, managed to track this down by noticing the ""A"" permit on the parking sign (far right of original image above), which led to this SF parking permit map: http://www.sfmta.com/services/permits-citations/parking-permits/residential-area-permits/request-permit-area-expansion .

Case in point, I used to work for Academy Sports & Outdoors. If you're not familiar, on their end caps (shelves at the end of the isle) they have a slot for little price flipbooks. There is enough space in the slot for a dollar sign, two larger sized numbers(dollars) and two smaller sized numbers(cents). The product in the end cap I was working on was over $100, so I didn't have space.

I went to my manager with 3 options: Drop the dollar sign, drop the cents, or use some tape to hold it all up there. After a moment of stunned silence, she told me that she couldn't believe I had come up with solutions, since everyone always says that they can't do it and expects her to solve the problem.

The bottom of the cloud layer marks a change in the air's density, which is unstable when the cloud layer/open layer are moving in different directions, or at different speeds. The clouds will roll up into a tight spiral, then break and flatten.

the one benefit it has is the fact motorcyclists get rear-ended A LOT.  i mean a LOT.  drivers see THROUGH us, even as they are driving.  let's say there is 50 feet between motorcyclist and car behind.  and there 50 feet from motorcyclist to the car in front of the moto.  first car slows to stop at a light.  thus motorcyclist begins to brake.  the car behind will ignore the bike and will think he has 100 ft to stop.  and will manage hit the bike, even if he wasn't tailgaiting.

But in all reality, I was injured as a damn grown man and the room I was in was unnerving.  It really felt like the scan was just there to confirm the worst because of how ominous it seemed.  Then again, I did have a head injury, so I may not have the greatest recollection of feelings and thoughts from that evening.Every time I go through the kids section of a hospital I ask, Why isn't the rest of the hospital like this.

It gets ~128 gallons to the mile. They use a laser level system to keep stable as it moves up a 5% grade incline to the launch site.

The Vehicle Assembly Building, where the boosters and fuel tank are attached to the Shuttle, is so large that it can rain inside the building. The door to the building is larger than the statue of liberty and takes 45 minutes to open. On the side of the building is an American flag. The stars on the flag are the 6ft wide, the blue area as big as a basketball court, and each stripe is as wide as a standard car lane. FUN FACT: The road is made from crushed rock because reinforced concrete isn't strong enough to support the combined weight of the shuttle and crawler. They have to periodically replace the crushed rock because it gets pulverized to dust.Not sure if anyone cares but those roads are made up of a bunch of smooth-ish rocks (it's not a paved road) that they have to rake and re-fill after every trip.

The House Dog's Grave - Robinson Jeffers

I've changed my ways a little; I cannot now
Run with you in the evenings along the shore,
Except in a kind of dream; and you, if you dream a moment,
You see me there.

So leave awhile the paw-marks on the front door
Where I used to scratch to go out or in,
And you'd soon open; leave on the kitchen floor
The marks of my drinking-pan.

I cannot lie by your fire as I used to do
On the warm stone,
Nor at the foot of your bed; no, all the night through
I lie alone.

But your kind thought has laid me less than six feet
Outside your window where firelight so often plays,
And where you sit to read--and I fear often grieving for me--
Every night your lamplight lies on my place.

You, man and woman, live so long, it is hard
To think of you ever dying
A little dog would get tired, living so long.
I hope than when you are lying

Under the ground like me your lives will appear
As good and joyful as mine.
No, dear, that's too much hope: you are not so well cared for
As I have been.

And never have known the passionate undivided
Fidelities that I knew.
Your minds are perhaps too active, too many-sided....
But to me you were true.

You were never masters, but friends. I was your friend.
I loved you well, and was loved. Deep love endures
To the end and far past the end. If this is my end,
I am not lonely. I am not afraid. I am still yours.
...and now I'm crying at work. Reminds me of this; why dogs live short lives according to a 6 year old.

As you can see [here](http://fineartamerica.com/images-simple-print/images-medium-5/mr-rogers-statue-in-pittsburgh-emmanuel-panagiotakis.jpg)I was about to riff on the statue but then I thought of how Mr. Rogers would just say he loves it just the way it is.Tell that to this [Bill Cosby statue.](http://www.seeing-stars.com/Images/slides/EmmyPlaza-BillCosby.JPG)There are numerous statues around Pittsburgh made in this horrifying, igneous rock like style. I have no clue why we decide to commemorate people this way. Millenia from now another civilization will happen upon these monuments and think we were a culture that worshiped rock demons...and the battle raged on for a century

many lives were claimed, but eventually

the champion stood, the rest saw their better:

Mr. Rogers in a bloodstained sweater

OH SNAP ive been to that statue and I know I can find a picture of me laying in its arms I really hope a cop walked up to them.  ""What are you doing?"" ""knitting Mr. Rodgers a sweater"" and the cop just walked away.They got the Albert Einstein statue in DC too

Can someone please build a Mr. Rogers statue with a material *other* than fear?I'm actually really fascinated with this statue. Whatever it is made out of makes him look like some kind of mud monster that would be in my nightmares as a child, but at the same time it perfectly portrays his gentle smile and eyes. Does anyone know who the artist is?

**Edit:** Never mind, I found it. It's by [Robert Berks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Berks). Looking through his other stuff, I have determined that I would try to buy some of his work if I ever became rich. Mr. Roger's was an amazing man that I watched every day growing up. May he rest in peace.I am suitably pleased that it's a cardigan with a zipper. It's very in-tune with his normal show attire!An interesting fact I haven't seen mentioned here. All of the cardigans he ever wore in the show were knit by his Mother. 

I like the zipper. It's a nice touch.  
  
To think they could have gone with giant buttons or simply tying it with string, but they installed a really long zipper instead intrigues me.  
  
That's really cool for some reason.The Smithsonian Institute displays one of his sweaters as a ""Treasure of American History.""Who would make a statue of Mr. Rogers out of molten crap?What is this? Is this supposed to be a statue of Mr. Rogers in the seconds following him being hit by a nuclear blast wave? 

*""Now children... what is that noise?""*Pittsburgh, Huzzah!I'd love to see that statue in person.
I always wanted to meet him and thank him for all the things he did for the children in my Generation.[deleted]","{'Sadness': 0.060269, 'Anger': 0.537313, 'Analytical': 0.125, 'Emotional_Range': 0.893, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Joy': 0.104616, 'Disgust': 0.04085, 'Confident': 0.308, 'Conscientiousness': 0.104, 'Fear': 0.320062, 'Openness': 0.225, 'Extraversion': 0.711, 'Agreeableness': 0.628}"

I held onto it for two days until I could find a safe place to release it. 

In the meantime, he made for a terrible pet. They're nocturnal, picky eaters, they have stink glands, and 'Puma' would just curl up anytime I got close to him. 

The first night I woke up to the sound of him crawling up my window.

Sandslash!http://pangolins.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/dog-pangolin-costume1.jpg[deleted]I actually just finished my paper on the poaching of pangolins for science and it's pretty damn depressing what these animals go through.... 

Apparently people think that they can cure cancer and all this other stuff so illegal traders make fortunes off of every part of the pangolins, so they're pretty high in demand in certain parts of the world. 
Also, they're really easy to catch in the wild because their defense tactics are to roll up super tight into a ball until they think it's okay to release themselves, and usually by that point they're held in tight cages with a bunch of other pangolins, awaiting to be sold off to dealers who poach them alive and make tonics from their blood. :|

Another thing is that, since they're endangered, it makes it quite popular for places to serve pangolin fetuses as delicacies in areas such as East Asia because it signifies a person's status to be a sign of being above the law to ""afford such a meal.""

Anyway, if anyone cares and wants to help with the prevention of poaching, although it might be quite minuscule, you can start off by just spreading the word! Bringing awareness to the pangolin and their situations might even enlighten celebrity support and maybe boost a couple social marketing campaigns (hopefully before they go extinct), but that's just the treehugging/animallover inside me speaking because last time I checked, the media runs on justin bieber and miley scandals, but idunno, maybe it'll change someday.In the battles I fantasize taking place between different fairy/gnome tribes in the untouched wilderness, I imagine these are the tanks of the different armies, shrugging off the little spears and arrows being fired by the enemy while charging the oncoming soldiers and trampling them.

Translated excerpts from [Norwegian national broadcaster NRK](http://www.nrk.no/ho/_-verdens-eldste-revolver-1.11628328) (article with film clip):

The revolver started its history at a weaponsmith's in Nürnberg, Germany. The year was 1597. Once it was a status symbol, with its decorations in brass, bone and mother-of-pearl. More than 400 years later it is well preserved in a cellar in Lillehammer, Norway.

- The reason we know it's from 1597 is because it has a mark in shape of a horse spur. This tells us with certainty that it is made of the German weaponsmith Hans Stopler, director Gaute Jacobsen of the Maihaugen collections says.

The revolver has belonged to the German Georg von Reichswein. He was a proffessional soldier and fought on the Danish-Norwegian side in the 30-year war (1618-1648).

- We are not quite sure wether he had the revolver when he came to Norway in 1628 or wether he bought it in Bergen in 1636, Jacobsen states.

Did it fire similar to todays pin fired cartridges?

Looks like you place a paper cartridge and a pellet in each chamber, then to fire, you rotate to a loaded chamber, slide back the lid, fill the pan with gun powder then pull the trigger.

If that's how it fired, I wonder how possible that a spark could ignite all chambers at once.See that knob on the end?

That's something to think about.That's still 2 more shark-related deaths than we had in Canada.To give you some background this picture was taken in Perth as one of many protests which occured all over Australia to protest the culling of sharks in Australia for safety. Perth in particular wants to use baited nets to lure and catch and kill sharks close to swimming beaches. Many believe this will kill not only large (possibly dangerous) sharks but also smaller sharks that pose no threat to people.Plot Twist: Obesity is the nickname of a freakishly large shark that terrorises beach goers nation wide.[deleted]I'll deal with the sharks if it means not having to use a spatula and warm water to get my balls un-frozen from my car seat.> Skin Cancer: 2000

I think this means you're safer in the water than on the beach.I don't fear dying from a shark attack, I fear being awake and alive with a shredded appendage on a sandy beach.Just playing devil's advocate here but what is difference in the percentage of people that expose themselves to sharks (entering the ocean) to people that expose themselves to things such as cancer (breathing)?CULL THE LIGHTNINGI've always found it interesting that prostate, colonic and lung cancers kill more people that breast cancer each year but they never seem to make these lists.

Stupid people will always need other people to think for them and lack basic common sense.  
Getting into the ocean where these animals live and feed to survive is a necessary risk that every sane person here accepts. It'd be like going on safari dressed like an antelope and then complaining when too many people are getting attacked by lions.  
There's a lot of ""hypothesis"" bandied around about why attacks are apparently increasing, but the simple truth is there's less food for the seals, seals come closer to shore to feed, sharks love a good fatty seal and mistakenly have a nibble on something wearing a wetsuit. I thought it was a huge sign in the sand until i scrolled down and saw the hand - that's actually a very tiny sign!It's no wonder only 2 people died from drinking energy drinks. You have to drink *way* too much for it to kill you.I live in one of the towns were somebody was killed by a shark in 2013. It was really sad, he was just a teenager bodyboarding one day and attacked at one of the safest beaches in the area. His friends had to pull his body out of the water (very brave of them in blood-filled waters) but he was dead before the ambulance got there. 

I work in menswear and the boys mother came in to choose a suit for her son's funeral. She was so devastated and you could tell that she hadn't been able to accept her son's death. She seemed so out of it, walking around in a daze and telling herself ""he would have liked this one "" as she paid for the suit.

While there are few shark attacks in Australia, they are still a tragedy and can affect a whole community like in the case of this attack.Well this is only deaths, you're leaving out attacks. Oh and it looks like the chick in the dark skirt left of the sign has her tits flopping outWithout considering the risk of danger of a certain activity, these numbers are meaningless. More people died from lightning than Russian roulette last year!I wish the topless girl to the left would turn around.I like how Australian dies in even numbers.

It's the world's largest museum of science and technology. You can spend Weeks there without coming close to seeing everything.

Edit: All-> aww/r/ThingsCutInHalfPorn/Wait where is the area where you sneak around the plane to silently take out the hijackers and then eventually get in a gun battle down there and jump out with a parachute that's mounted on the wall

There clearly isn't enough room for all that in this cross section, I call fake how many people are surprised at the structural basis of an airplane.. you didn't think we could put hundreds of people on a craft with all their stupid shit luggage and fly them at 10s of thousands of feet up in the air AND do it with a tank's armor plating did you?

Reminds me of flying military transport, where they just ignore the plastic panels and overhead luggage racks and just bolt you into a metal tube where you are exposed to all the wiring and ducts. Much louder too.  Deutsches museum, Munich!The Lufthansa box looks extremely content.Where do they keep the snakes?Wings, Check

Engines, Mostly

Fusalage, Some

Close enough, she's ready to fly. I never could figure out what the notch is for. TIL that luggage doesn't go into the plane indidvidually, but rather in those boxy cart things.mmm dat leg room

Someone buy him a non alcoholic beer.I've worked in the service industry for a long time (Since I was 16) and I never found it hard to abide by these rules. Here's the problem though, some people think they can treat service industry workers as servants. 

So you're having a bad day or we made a small mistake somewhere along the way while helping you. That doesn't mean we are all incompetent idiots who deserve disrespect. No, you aren't justified in fucking with us because your paycheck happens to be larger than ours. 

There should ALWAYS be a mutual respect between patrons and workers. Doncaster East represent

Ali is a fucking godIt's like the opposite of the Soup Nazi.

Kebab Ghandi.Fuck, now i want a kebabI work in a supermarket chain an we have the same sign in the breakroom directly above the schedule, so everyone has to see it. It claims to be a quote by Mahatma Ghandi but there was no source to prove it. :/It's nice to see someone still understands the business model of the service industry. That's rare... and beautiful.Our local Kebab place could learn a lesson. The food is so-so, but the service is terrible. Always a feeling that they could really do without your money. Smarmy little bastards.

But where else am I supposed to get a munchie box at two in the morning?My Kebab store has a sign like [this one](http://www.philebrity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Photo1188.jpg).""The customer is always right"" 

Enabling dickheads since 1973.The people in my town don't need to be reminded of this, as many of them treat anyone in the service industry like scum already. I would love to post something like this in my family's restaurant, because I actually agree, but I fear the repercussions. =\ I have been a customer of Ali's since he started in a caravan in Doncaster, every time I walk in he seems happy to see me and has conversations with me. He also remembers my order and asks if I want the usual. Ali is a top bloke and I'm happy to after he started with a small caravan he has moved onto owning 3 shops. 
Tl;dr Ali is awesome classic AliAli. Top bloke. Ali has a lot of balls for taking credit for that statement. It was  Kenneth B. Elliott who came up with the framework for it and it's been attributed to everyone from LL Bean to Gandhi. lolIt's missing one line:  ""We will treat you with the respect you deserve.  All we ask is you do the same for us.""  

You get crappy people working in the service industry because they've been worn down by years of abuse.  Good, kind, hard working people gradually turn indifferent and rude from all the crap they have to deal with from entitled customers.  

Imagine if someone walked into your office or wherever it is you work and belittled you for a typo, screamed at you because your computer crashed and you need a moment to restart it, so on and so forth.  A good day in retail or food service is a day you haven't been called a liar or otherwise insulted repeatedly to your face.  Why don't more businesses understand the profitability of humility? Nothing makes a business a success faster than building customer loyalty. Props to the storeowner.  Now show me an ISP that is willing to say this...Mitcham??

Ingredients
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup cooking oil or butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions
1. In a medium bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in center of flour mixture; set aside.
2. In another medium bowl beat eggs slightly; stir in milk, oil, and vanilla. Add egg mixture all at once to flour mixture. Stir just until moistened (batter should be slightly lumpy).
3. Pour 1 to 1 1/4 cups batter onto grids of a preheated, lightly greased waffle baker (use a regular or Belgian waffle baker). Close lid quickly; do not open until done. Bake according to manufacturers directions. When done, use a fork to lift waffle off grid. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm.
4. Makes 12 to 16 (4-inch) wafflesDOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY[deleted]Woooah! Double rainbow! If you live in Chester's Mill, ME, don't panic.

Blood.   Little tiger ass hole.  But now I can tell folks I got attacked by a tiger. I wish it was possible to own one of those cute little bastards without all the slashing and mauling. All I can see are socks and sandals.At least he classed it up and put on black socks to match his black sandals.""THEY'RE GREAT""Down vote for being a shoobie.

Ha! Growing up in a family with a matriarch who had lived through the Depression, this ain't nothin'. 

My grandmother insisted we carefully open each present, preserving as much of the paper as humanly possible. Then she would *iron* the paper, and cut off any ragged or torn edges. The paper would then be carefully rolled around an old cardboard tube or neatly folded, and reused the following year. Bows, ribbon, and other accoutrements were also saved and reused. 

When I was about sixteen, which would have been in 1987, I opened a small box of earrings wrapped in paper printed with the words: ""Merry Christmas 1939."" This scrap of paper was the last bit of the roll, and quite faded and creased. It had been wrapping gifts nearly every year in our family for over fifty years! I felt sort of proud to be the final recipient of those perky Scottish terriers wearing bow-ties and skipping merrily through once-scarlet fields. 

Needless to say, I spent years learning to rip the paper off gifts with gleeful abandon, and still struggle not to carefully slip the paper off today.

EDIT: I'm aware how the physics of stability work. What I meant to say is 30° feels like a lot even in an off road car, I would not have thought a double-decker bus would be capable of that.all calculations aside this is still the easiest way to test for rolling. I was in FSAE and our cars have to pass a 60 degree tilt test to make sure the car is stable should it lose control and also to make sure that all fluids are well contained.

So there is no danger of moving tip over.

They appear taut from what I can tell, which would mean that the bus should have actually turned over.Check the video. At 28 degrees the bus is actually tipped.

Great to see it from this perspective. I've been there with my (then) girlfriend. We wanted to go up this very mountain, but hadn't considered the fact that we had to cross several streams, so in the end, we didn't go.

Behind the highest climber runs a river, which streams past the camping place that lies at the foot of the smaller hill on his right. The black field below his feet is is filled with huge blocks of obsidian. With a bit of sunshine these blocks look stunning, as the black stone contains all sorts of colours, like a rainbow.
There's a trail that leads of to the left, past the foot of the hill, to the Brennisteinslada, a volcano, which has some crazy fumeroles, creating a faerie-like landscape. The mountains here have all sorts of minerals in them, which makes the slopes surprisingly beautiful and colourful. This is especially visible from the mountain in the centre of the picture, of which I forgot the name.

Edit: oh, and the small river (runs next to the campsite) that is heated by means of geothermal energy is fantastic. In my experience the weather was hardly ever as nice as this. In fact it was grey and cold most of the time.

What if the entire universe was just some substance with light shining through and refracting/reflecting shadows and that's what we are living in?The new show room at Budget Rugs, Murals, and Ceilings. The Horadric Cube! Get drunk, spin fixture. Try to stand. Is there a name for this style of lighting?  That is, many holes in the shade, kind of middle eastern pattern.  I have seen lamps with it before and I have wondered what it is called.In order for this to work and have a sharp image on the wall, the light source would have to be extremely small.  I can't imagine a point source of light like this being bright enough to cast a strong enough shadow to have the pattern visible when there is enough light on in the room to do other things.  You'd need a 60-100w incandescent-equivalent light source which somehow gives light in all directions but that can dissipate all that heat from its very small surfaces.  I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that a practical system like this would be much less impressive in real life than in this picture.  In the picture (if it is real) the exposure was adjusted to give the impression of a bright room with a lot of contrast.

Here's an awesome video of a 3D mapping projection during the 600th anniversary celebration. It blew my mind the first time I saw it.

I would love to climb that clock tower.They cut out the creators eyes so he could never replicate another model anywhere else. He removed an important part so it didn't work for properly for 100 years. Not the most amazing visuals, which is why tourists complain about it being overrated but it is 600 years old and it's history is really interesting. I went to Prague a few years back right at this time of year (for the record, its fucking cold).  We went on a walking tour (fairly sure it was this group http://www.neweuropetours.eu/ highly recommended) and had a tour-guide that had recently been fired , but they asked him to work the week of Christmas because he was the only one that was available.  

I asked him what caused him to be fired and he said that clock, and some 'butthurt local residents'.  I asked what he meant, and he said that he was saying some non-positive things about the clock, locals overheard and complained about it and the tourgroup just stop scheduling him for the tours.  So I of course, asked what he said.  

""The is honestly one of the most useless clocks in the world.  Quick, look at it, tell me what time it is!!  That's right, you can't."" 

Cool looking clock for sure. Voted as one of the most overrated tourist traps in the world. But its actually pretty cool to see in person.Impressive, but ultimately it won't save the town from the falling moon. It was impressive, but I think some of the other parts of the city were more beautiful and impressive.  

p.s. Look out for pickpockets while you are trying to watch the clock chime[deleted]Amazing video of a light show projected on this clock. It's one of the coolest videos I have seen on the internet.

As someone who was born in Prague, then moved to the states as a baby and has visited many times, we always make time in our trip to stop here. No, it's not the most exciting thing at face value, but the idea that someone was able to make a clock like this that could accurately read so many different things 600 years ago is astounding.

Sure there are more beautiful things to look at in [Prague](http://imgur.com/Hwm3k0D) and the [Czech Republic as a whole](http://imgur.com/kA9fMtZ), but appreciation for those bits that may not look as good is still a nice thing.Clock TownIs it possible to reproduce this clock with 3D printing? 

Anyone have the modeling rendered?My gf and I have been trying to complete a 1000-piece puzzle of this thing. I quickly found out that I am not a puzzle guy.I work more-or-less opposite that (opposite and a bit to the side, tbh). It can be quite annoying trying to get through the Orloj-watching crowd to and from the office in my lunch break, but it's worth that inconvenience to work in such an elaborately beautiful part of town.That's beautiful.The puppets all represent something. The most obvious one is the skeleton depicting death.

The one on the most left (I think) used to look like a stereotypical jew, depicting greed. Only the Russians removed its beard because it looked to much like Lenin. And they didn't want Lenin portraided as a greedy jew.

I mean, it's sweet y'all think so highly of us, but we lock our doors, get our bikes stolen, and suffer more or less as much crime as our southern cousins; or, more accurately, more or less as little crime as our southern cousins, since violent crime has been steadily decreasing for many years in both countries, in spite of increasing news coverage.If this was America there wouldn't be people putting money there and if someone did someone would take it.That's really quite impressive.

The restaurant this is from is in Barrie, Ontario. If the mods contact me I can provide proof (I don't want to offer up their personal information to everyone) this thread just says to me how shitty reddit can be. as if i weren't already aware. 

this note was left by my good friend's father. his mom battled cancer quite bravely and sadly lost her fight last month. 

have some fucking respect. I know this won't convince those who don't want to believe it could be true but here's the deal. Mom died on Dec. 30. Dad went to dinner last night and then told me this morning about what he did. A friend sent us the link to the photo that had been uploaded here. It's all true. 
That's my dad's abysmal handwriting. 
The OP said it happened in Barrie.

This is mom's obituary (Note Carol and Lee Ballantyne (Lee B) and Barrie): http://peacefultransition.ca/obituaries/ballantyne-carol/

This is my blog where I chronicled mom's last days: http://runningfromtheblackdogs.blogspot.ca/2013/12/a-christmas-love-letter.html

Not sure what else I can do to prove it happened. Either way, I'm not going to show dad this thread because it's not what he needs to read right now.I blogged about mom's (Carol's) last days. Writing about it helped me process what I was feeling. I'm posting a link in the hopes it might help some of the those so quick to dismiss the loss of a loved one see that not only is the story true but it's about real people dealing with a devastating loss: http://runningfromtheblackdogs.blogspot.ca/
I wrote this one on Christmas Day: http://runningfromtheblackdogs.blogspot.ca/2013/12/a-christmas-love-letter.html
This one was written the morning after mom was admitted to hospice: http://runningfromtheblackdogs.blogspot.ca/2013/12/a-new-day.html
This one was written on the day she died: http://runningfromtheblackdogs.blogspot.ca/2013/12/the-remains-of-day.htmlhttp://replygif.net/i/1242.gif*sigh* I'll say it again. This story is true -- I'm Lee's oldest son-- and it happened last night. It's not a repost, it's not a fake, it was my dad having a very human and emotional reaction to seeing a young couple who reminded him of mom and him in earlier days. Would producing a death certificate, a la George Costanza, help? I'm the oldest son of the man who paid for the couple's dinner. We lost our beautiful wife and mother Jan. 30 who died at the age of 62 from complications from the chemo she was undergoing for lung cancer. I worry about dad who was married to mom for 43 years but I'm so proud he's finding ways like this to deal with his grief. He's an amazing dad and was -- as mom put it in her last days -- the best thing that happened to her. He feels the same way.Put it away, guys. It's been confirmed trueLike seriously, Can people start putting NSFW tags on stuff like this ? I just cried at work for the billionth time thanks to redditMy mom's obituary...http://peacefultransition.ca/obituaries/ballantyne-carol/[deleted]One more thing (I'm the man's oldest son). I know this is the internet and all but it's disheartening to see so many cynically respond to this post in a game of let's-see-how-witty-I-can-be-in-my-response or be so ready to be judgmental about my father's kind action. He wasn't trying to ""draw"" random strangers into his ""drama."" He had a very human and emotional reaction to seeing a younger couple doing something he used to enjoy doing with his wife and reacted with kindness. Its so sad to see so many haters out there and how Carol's son has to prove to people that his mother really did pass away. 
People, if you don't like this... move on. No one asked for your nasty opinion. I really don't understand why people always need to hate on something.[deleted]So your friend works at a copypasta restaurant?/r/thatHappened Just to close out my participation in this -- just talked to dad. The couple tracked him down today with help from the waitress, told him they were incredibly touched and want to take him out to dinner. So, yay humanity.I BELIEVE YOU OP

Reverse image search seems to be in your favor.my dad did this for a group of police officers and fire fighters enjoying a meal at boston pizza, he paid for all 10 of them anonymously and when i asked him why he said ""their job is hard enough, this is the least i can do"" Crying.It's called suspension of disbelief.  Pretend to have a soul, reddit, and accept for a moment that there might be actual good in the world.As for ridiculing dad for saying it would put a smile on mom's face, I'm an atheist, but my mom wasn't and my dad isn't. So what if he believes she's somewhere else looking down on him? I don't but I'm not going to mock him for his beliefs anymore than he would mock me for mine.""It will make me happy...  for now""

Soon only blood will bring him happinessJust the ""...for now"" makes this whole thing seem too melodramatic to be real. Come on.

So after Ukraine turned down trade with EU, and stuck with Russia basically, West Ukraine had been protesting. This is not to be confused with East Ukraine. They were protesting mostly peacefully. It started to get more violent after around 300 young adults were protesting peacefully got beat by the Ukraine police while they were laying down sleeping. But even after that incident most of the protesting was very peaceful. Then Ukraine made protesting illegal a couple days ago, than the violent rioting began. West Ukraine pretty much had enough and want the Ukraine president to step down. They have already stormed into a governors office and made one resign, after cheering and singing Christmas carols.

During the protesting or rioting whatever so far I think four protestors have died. The protestors that were hurt that went to the hospital a lot of them have been kidnapped, or thrown in jail still wounded. One of the protestors that was wounded and kidnapped got found in the woods beaten to death. Last night the protestors started fires on the street to barricade themselves from the police, using tires to keep the fire going. They were also throwing Molotovs at the police. The police were throwing water bombs at the protestors in below freezing weather, and also throwing Molotovs back.

Today I read that they are keeping the violence at bay until the activists of the protestors get to speak with the president of Ukraine. They want the president to step down.

Some of you may think this is stupid that they are rioting, causing violence. I even had one person ask me why don't they just peacefully protest, what are the police going to do, lock them all up? Well, let me explain. These people have tried peacefully protesting for months. They have been beaten. They have had their right to protest taken away. They are at the edge of the cliff, and if they don't fight back they will fall. And the answer to ""they can't throw them all in jail"" No, they can't, but they can throw a lot of them in prison, and the prisons in Ukraine are not good. People have been known to be tortured. Also if they were peacefully protesting before and got beat by the police, do you think the police would be nice just because a larger group is being nice and peacefully protesting? No. They will beat those people also. It would probably be a lot worse if West Ukraine was not rioting right now and just all peacefully protesting.

It's like a big guy sitting there beating you every day. You have tried to talk to this big guy to get him to stop, you have tired negotiating with this big guy, you have tried everything to make him stop, but he wont. So what do you do? You finally fight him back. Violence isn't always the answer, but sometimes it's the only option left. If a civil war rises from this, the Ukraine Government has no one to blame but themselves. They have put their Ukrainian people against a wall, and the East Ukrainian people have decided to rise and fight back. They should be amended for their bravery against a corrupt government and treated with respect, and not down talked by some of you that have no idea what's going on, or what it truly is like to have a REAL corrupt government.

Also a lot of the red crosses that were there giving medical aid and food to the protestors, have been stormed by the police. I watched one video where the police went into the red cross and stole all of the red cross's stuff. Even shot one red cross member with a rubber bullet in his leg, even after the red cross member showed the police his red cross badge. This is not acceptable at all.

Edit: I also want to throw in here how annoyed I am that on popular news sites this is like 20-30 pages deep, and celebrities are front pages. YUP American news worthless.

Edit: Also going to post the streams I have been watching. So all of you can keep up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrZcAsPKK74 http://www.ustream.tv/channel/euromajdan/pop-out These are streams of the protests that are still going on. They stream 24/7. You can see the police and the protestors.

Edit: I will keep posting when I find out more.

Edit: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/world/europe/ukraine.html Some protestors stripped naked by police, and so on. More signs of brutality.

Edit: Also guys I will keep posting, but it's not hard to find out new information. A lot of it is posted on Reddit, you can also just go to Google and type in Ukraine, the new news stories will be posted at the top. Watching the streams also helps. If you have a Russian friend they can help translate when they start talking on the streams. If not maybe a Russian Redditor can help with that. <3 I really appreciate the upvotes, and I'm glad that some of you think this issue is just as important as I do. More world issues need to be brought into light like this one, enough of the stupid ass news stories that cloud our minds. This is the real world and we need to accept it so we can start helping in any way possible we can, rather it be going there and protesting with them, helping pass out food, or just getting the word out. Anything helps.

Edit: News about talks with the Ukraine president. Posted three hours ago. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25872417

Edit: Mikhailo Niskoguz claiming he was tortured by Ukraine police. Tons of reports have been showing up like this. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25858875 It's funny that none of this though is being posted on any major news site, or if it is, it's a ton of pages deep.

If I got any of this wrong or left anything out let me know. I will continue to post on this thread and the original comment any new news I've received.

Edit: Posting this as of 2:32 EST US TIME (9:32 AM UKR TIME) Posted 4 hours ago. Protests have spread outside of Kiev http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukraine-protests-spread-as-opposition-leaders-try-to-contain-violence/article16480111/

Edit: Read a comment asking what do the Ukrainians want and why they don't leave the country? They want the president to resign, they want trade with the EU still (this will probably be discussed at later times), and they want the right to protest back legally. And exactly where are all these protestors supposed to go? America is no longer accepting anyone that is known to be apart of the violent protests, and there are thousands of people.

Thousands are still able to travel to the states, but the fact remains, that thousands should not have to move from their homes because of a corrupt government. The government should be for the people always. I appreciate the person who messaged me with this correction, thank you. )

I will be posting more on what is happening as of now in Ukraine on this thread post.  http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1w0raq/was_told_to_post_this_for_those_of_you_who_want/  Please feel free to go here, upvote, discuss, and if you know anything about what is going on let me know so I can post it on the thread for more people to read. It is important we keep letting people know what is going on, since the main media is going out of his way not to talk about this issue at all. 

Edit: Whoever gave me Reddit gold I really appreciate it. I really do. Thank you for going out of your way and spending your money. Hope you have a great day, and life.

Please keep checking for updates on this issue on the post I made here : http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1w0raq/was_told_to_post_this_for_those_of_you_who_want/

It's important to keep this issue out in the open so people can understand what's going on, and keep following. This no longer only affects Ukraine but every single person in the world. Human rights should always be of the most importance.

I would never get that close to polar bears. I did a stint in a northern territory town when I was younger. I noticed that ever home there had two doors, a regular sized one and a smallish one you would be able to crawl through.
I asked what was the deal with the smaller doors everyone had and they told me it was in case a polar bear busted in the front door, you could get out through the smaller door and the bear couldn't follow. I thought it was all a joke before it happened no less than a dozen times during my stay.

I chatted with this guy a bunch down at the bone yard. He was on his four wheeler and rolled up to us in our rental and asked if we would leave a door open for him. We were pretty close and the big male started making circles. We hung out there for an hour or so and before we left he took his four wheeler and drove right around them while they were feasting. He's a little on the crazy side, which is apparent when you learn he's also a whaler.

Kaktovik is a pretty fun place, if anyone is interested I have some pictures and video I can upload of my recent work trip there. When I was a young kid (6-8), my father owned a refrigerated trucking company. The local zoo was moving their polar bear to Argentina to be with a mate, and the zoo contracted him to drive the bear (in a giant cage) from the zoo to LAX. When we were in the hanger at LAX and no one was looking, the polar bear had its nose up to this very tiny hole in the cage and I touched his nose. Reminded me of a dog nose. Obviously this was retarded, but hey I was a kid and it was a polar bear. I obviously hadn't watched much national geographic yet.Why is the camera man running away? O shi...That is one brave SOB.

If you have other questions that aren't answered there feel free to reply here or come to the /r/Amsterdam subreddit :)Was this land filled or carved to create these canals?[Steve Hughes standup about Amsterdam's approach to Health & Safety.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAnGYfnFz9I)[Heres a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tC1tc60vF4) about the expansion of Amsterdam from first town to present day.[map of amsterdam, by year of construction](http://citysdk.waag.org/buildings/)That photographer must have been pretty highFirst thought: that would be absolute hell to invade with a ground army. Beautiful planning though.  I visited Amsterdam over the summer and we rented some paddleboats to go through the canals and eventually end up back where we started. 
We assumed all the canals would have names, kinda like street names, and we also assumed we would be able to follow the map stuck on the front of the dash of the boat.

Nope.

We got lost in about 20 minutes, and, not knowing where we actually came from, spent an hour and a half trying to find our way back, all the while asking people ""Do you know where the paddle boat shop is?""
(We didn't realize at the time how vague that was.


It wasn't until after we dodged a dozen big tour boats (PADDLE FOR DEAR LIFE! ITS GONNA HIT US!) that we noticed another paddle boat with the same colour scheme as ours and started to follow it.
We didn't end up at the same spot we started, but we were just happy to be on land. I still don't know whether we actually gave our paddle boat back to the right company or if the one we rented from just assumed we hit a boat and drowned.Amsterdam, where travelling west to east never goes in a straight line.""Have you noticed that Amsterdam's concentric canals resemble the circles of hell? The middle-class hell, of course, peopled with bad dreams. When one comes from the outside, as one gradually goes through those circles, life — and hence its crimes — becomes denser, darker. Here, we are in the last circle.""

Camus ""We have both kinds of cheese, old *and* new.""Wish it was one of those insanely high res pics so i could zoom in to my fav part of town... ;)4000 years from now when Amsterdam is dug up. There will be talks about how aliens helped with the planning of the city Reminds me of the classical description of [Atlantis](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.unmuseum.org/atlantiscity.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.unmuseum.org/atlantis.htm&h=324&w=539&sz=60&tbnid=ohURH2KzdU-l9M:&tbnh=123&tbnw=205&zoom=1&usg=__MW33ImKgdy3lHVQy3DKBv_QaNOI=&docid=9XBZTZlnasZenM&sa=X&ei=0sFeUst5raLgA67fgdAK&ved=0CDcQ9QEwBA)Oh no!  It's a transmutation circle!It doesn't look like it, but on either side of most canals there is enough space for 1 lane of parking and one lane of one-way driving. That's not counting the huge amount of bicycles. For anyone who has read *The Fall* by Albert Camus, this is what Clament meant when he said Amsterdam resembles Hell; it is composed of nested circles and is below sea level.It's a giant transmutation circle!!I wonder if Father is underground planning the city wide circleFor anybody who has been lost in Amsterdam before, this photo is tremendously helpfulPosts like these really makes me proud of my little yet awesome country! I had no idea the canals curved like this.  No wonder the sun seemed to always be in my face when I was walking alongside the canals.  Good times, lovely city.I'm unfamiliar with Amsterdam.

Reddit has a thriving community of Bonsai growers and aficionados, who are quite willing to answer your questions regarding Wisteria and all sorts of other trees that are often used for bonsai.

Come say hello. Check out the sidebar for an insane amount of information.I want this more than is healthy.Lets get under that Tree of Souls and connect nervous systems. It's a good thing to bonsai wisteria  because that shit will take over everything if you let it.Aww. A weesteria.Finally!  Someone has cut-back a Wisteria plant often enough to break its spirit and stop it spreading like a wildfire.  

Non-bonsai Wysteria can take over your whole house.  I wouldn't let it near my place.I imagine this is where the fairies live.The only sane way to deal with Wisteria is fire.  That plant is the devil.Can these grow indoors?OP made the dangerous descent into the Devil's Cauldron in order to dig up this rare tree in hopes of selling it in order to finance a large supply of counterfeit bonsai trees for his local bonsai tree shop. Unfortunately, before he could get the tree and climb out, OP's climbing ropes were stolen by Terry Silver's band of hooligans, and the only way he could get them back was to sign up for the All-Valley Karate Tournament. Long story short, the tree turned out to have zero monetary value, and now resides in OP's grandmother's sun room. OP's grandmother happened to send this lovely photo to OP in a thank you/get well soon card while OP was in the hospital recovering from getting his ass beat in the tournament. It looks like a flower breathing wood dragon.I live in gardening zone 4b so this is not going to grow outdoors, however I've been thinking about getting a bonsai wisteria for indoors.  My best light is west facing.  Can anyone speak to wisteria as a houseplant? 
Also, I'm a bit disheartened by the guy saying it only blooms for a week.  Can anyone recommend a great blooming tree for indoor bonsai?
Thanks redditSaw one like this at the Cherry Blossom festival in San Francisco two years ago. It was over 80 years old and originally belonged to a lady who got the seedling kit for her birthday from her granddaughter and had cared for it for years with no blossoms.  When grandma passed away, the family went to clean out her apartment and the tree had finally blossomed.  I know I'm not doing the story justice, but very cool lineage and to see something that had been cared for so lovingly for so long was fascinating.[deleted]how big do these suckers get?  like will it say an inside plant or will you need to move it outisde?Wow that's beautiful I was going to get one of these bonsai flower trees for my wife for valentines day, but was afraid it wouldn't be in bloom, and therefore wouldn't look all the special.

A comparison with the N4 on the right.Here it is on [Street View](https://maps.google.ie/maps/myplaces?hl=en&ll=53.452456,-7.883277&spn=59.584863,191.777344&ctz=0&t=v&z=3&layer=c&panoid=bksT3U3CqhAFoHs1VnXm0A&cbll=53.452456,-7.883277&cbp=13,-231.9925629618751,,1,5.099324376664313). 80 km/h is the standard speed limit for most rural *[boreens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreen)* in Ireland. And no, these aren't one-way roads. Speed at your peril. [Here's another](https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.218564,-6.147497&spn=0.000944,0.002926&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=53.218551,-6.147628&panoid=wK6lfG1bq8PTND5iOMjK0Q&cbp=13,265.91,,0,11.7). Also many drivers in Ireland don't consider this a ""speed limit"", but instead more of a suggested or required average.

""Well if it says 80, I better go 80"".

Prepare to be airborne for most of this lane.Back to boards.ie with ye, lads. The beginning of The Guard is good for an idea of what most roads are like. Black humour on the speed and the Guards in Ireland.rural roads in Ireland are the stuff of dreams if you enjoy driving, it makes you a better driver you have no choice about it :P
nothing scarier than being flat down a back road and seeing a tractor pulling out of a gap :P keep her country ;)Some people do drive far too quickly on those sorts of roads. I think often they're locals who assume that because they know every turn and bump on the road and drive it at speed every day nothing unexpected will ever happen.

Setting a speed limit for a local road like that is a matter for the local council. There is a [national review](http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0208/speed.html) of speed limits ongoing in Ireland at the request of the Minister for Transport. The aim is to bring them into line with guidelines circulated by the government in January 2011. It is, ironically, a very slow process.http://imgur.com/G4OXx

It's also probably a dual carriageway.Stick the Subaru logo in the corner and we've got ourselves a winning billboard advertisement.My brother drives very fast down country lanes a little wider than that in England. 

On a moonlit night he will turn his headlights off and drive even faster, to show how well he knows the roads, and say ""don't worry, if a car's coming the other way we'll see his headlights"" ... [brief pause] ... ""unless it's Dave. Dave likes to do this too"". And then he smiles. Being an American that's driven the majority of the Emerald Isle, I was constantly amazed at how ridiculous the speed limits were. I'd go maybe 20 km/h under the limit, feel I was going too fast and still have people up against my back bumper. Driving there is, in a word, insane.I learned to drive manual on vacation in Ireland.  Zipping around those roads in a tiny car was the most enjoyable driving experience of my life.    Taking the coastal road in Co Clare was gorgeous, and dodging the massive tour buses just added an extra challenge.  For safety of life and limb I preferred to stick to the R roads though.That's actually an old picture, there's a toll bridge just after the speed limit sign now. My friend went to Northern Ireland and tore the driver's side mirror off the rental car on one of these roads when meeting an oncoming truck. When he returned the car they were just like ""Yeah, that's what happens. Have a nice day.""As an Irishman I can assure you all that 80kph is a grand speed for this road. You don't even need to steer, those soft looking ditches on either side will gently nudge you back on track if you lose your way.Damn, I miss Ireland. 

Nice landscape & reasonable speed limits.

(Also, as a german, i must insist: 80 km/h != Autobahn !)Thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x84r.jpg) was pretty funny my first time there on those narrow roads.There's nothing more terrifying than when I'm in the passenger seat of my gf's car, and she takes he country roads out to Donegal and they're all exactly like this picture. We'll pass an 80kmph sign, and she'll turn to me with this evil grin like ""I'm gonna fuck you up!""

We're from N. Ireland where the roads laws are a bit more strict. I think Dara O'Brien but it best. 

In the UK there is Legal and Illegal. Righ and Wrong.
In the Republic of Ireland, there are 3 levels. 
1. That's Grand. 
2. Ah now, don't push it.
3. You're taking the piss.  One of my most vivid memories of Ireland is driving on a two-lane road the size of a shoulder on a cliff-side and having people whiz by at 80 km/h.WHOAH, here in spain the limit in not paved roads are 30km/h.

I call it phone fishing and it is very profitable.Credit goes to random person on my newsfeed!This is in Hoboken, NJ. I charged my phone at this exact location yesterday. there are a few blocks with power and every resident has laid out power cords for people to charge their phones. Restaurants were also giving out free food to any residents who needed. Truly a great display of human kindnessIs that Hoboken? My uncle used to live in an apartment in Hoboken that has gates just like those.That's fucking awesome, I love friendly neighbors.

I bet he is using the plug of the neighbor he doesn't like :)I'm sure this will get buried and no one will see it but I was one of the people who benefited from the generosity of these folks in Hoboken.

[deleted]Thanks for the update OP! WHAT ARE THEY DOING OUTSIDE THE WALL?!god damn mongolians keep breaking my shitty wall

but for real gj redditHey, I used to live in Africa.  You built your wall poorly.

Specifically, you should not use razor wire.  The Africans will defeat the razor wire by throwing a blanket or straw mat over it and just hop over the wall.  Sometimes, they build the wall and put metal spears or broken glass on the top; these too, in my opinion, are poor deterrents.

The best thing to do is to grow bugambilia from the inside of the compound along the wall.  The thorns are very sharp -- like sewing needles -- and it's a very good deterrent.  The kids will no doubt want to play along the wall, and you can deter them by growing thorny bushes along the outside perimeter, and putting some thick hedges along the inside perimeter.  I say this because, looking at your wall, I'm pretty sure it'll fall over if pushed often enough.  (I used to have a factory in Uganda and, from experience, have built many walls.)

The general idea is that you want your iron door to be the ""easiest"" option for forced entry.

If you're serious about security, you also need a dog.  If you're going to neglect the dog, then you need two dogs, so they can keep each other company (dogs are pack animals).  Never beat the dog.  The Africans will want to beat the dog, but don't let them.  If you let them beat the dog, they're going to bark like hell but not bite whenever someone jumps over your wall.Glad we could all help out. I hope Omari and all the children can live safely....and not ONE laser turret?  I am disappoint.


Joking aside.  So happy we could make one little piece of your world a little more secure.  Hmmm.. I'm not happy about this situation.

My mum knew this, so one day to teach me a lesson, she let me ride front passenger seat, no belt, and then she made a sudden brake to a complete stop, (probably nothing more than 5 km/h, but still).

It worked though. I banged my head against the windscreen, so it had to be replaced. After the bang, eyes closed, the first thing I said was ""Am I still here?"". I was so afraid what had happened to me. Fortunately (well, hopefully) it was just a bang.

I've always worn a seatbelt since.

When I was fairly young in my driving career (I still am, but I haven't even come close to an accident since this one) I was sid e swiped at about 55-60 mph (88-96 kph). I lost my car and nearly lost my life. Despite being only about 130 and extremely skinny, I was kept in my seat, coming inches to sharp, twisted metal.

I had failed to yield, and now that most of my friends are beginning to drive, I always warn them about yielding so that they don't lose both their car and their lives.

Craziness!  For those curious, this pic was taken at the WAIS Divide deep field camp during the 08-09 season.  We were jealous we didn't have a pole like south pole, so we made one out of  orange p-cord and an ice-core tube.  Then we filled a balloon with water (colored with blue food coloring) and let it freeze for the top globe.  Good stuff.  

We then decided it would be funny to set up a staged photo for outreach.  I wanted to see if I could really stump 3rd graders when I got home by telling them that we have to hold on for dear life when in Antarctica....or we'd fall off!  Needless to say, a lot of them were really confused.

I was at WAIS doing research as part of my PhD in glaciology/geosciences.  I have spent 5 concurrent seasons at WAIS, but sadly this past season will likely be my last.  Here was one of the original pics:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/3351699787/in/set-72157615204788872

-Carl deGrasse PaulNBC USA's coverage of the 2012 London Olympics has failed on all levels.  
The commentators talked over the entire opening ceremonies.  
NBC USA edited the opening ceremony to eliminate a non-American centric memorial.  (It's their country you fuckwads.)  
NBC USA went above and beyond to create nonexistent rivalries among the members of the US swim team.   
Perhaps my memory is faulty, but I don't ever recall ABC being as myopic as NBC has proven.  
oh shit, I sound like Sheldon Cooper, Phd.Dude, that dudes name is bong.Yes, they did cut away during it, but most likely it was because it isn't actually that important. If anything, NBC played up the meeting as being more momentous than it actually was and exaggerated the extent to which they are rivals.

  Dull would he be of soul who could pass by	 
  A sight so touching in its majesty.	 
This city now doth like a garment wear	 
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,  
  Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie	 
  Open unto the fields, and to the sky,—	 
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.	 
Never did sun more beautifully steep	 
  In his first splendour valley, rock, or hill;  
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!	 
  The river glideth at his own sweet will:	 
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;	 
  And all that mighty heart is lying still!

Thumbs up for rational thought.Those people... They look real.Europe, fuck yeahIs there a picture of Obama after he *signed* ACTA?I don't usually like the European parliament. It is slow and ineffective.

For the first time in years, however, I am proud of it.What if politicians just make up unpopular laws, so that they can shoot them down and look like heros.

Edit - repost of something that got lost below in my reply to Sindragon.

>As reported else where, ACTA demanded the criminalisation of ""commercial-scale"" copyright infringement. A very broad term you could drive a (legal) bus through....and that could potentially turn tens of thousands of internet users into criminals overnight - no joke.

>ACTA specifically was a fundamentally poorly drafted piece of legislation that could potentially threaten online freedom of expression & privacy - and a good opportunity, should it of been enacted, for media owners/content providers to crack-down....*unfairly*. This should of been made clearer.My first thought as an American, upon seeing a picture of the European Parliament for the first time:

""These people actually look like they represent a real cross section of the population, rather than a bunch of rich old men and women in suits, and their young progeny.""

I wish our legislative bodies looked and acted more like that.As someone living in the UK, I was really scared it was gonna go through, considering how much of America's bitch we've been for the past 10 years. Good on them for not being corporate whores.  I wish we still had such guts.These people seem so...representative, and normal.  personable, approachable.  So different then the USI can't help but think that if this whole anti-ACTA campaign would not have been put in motion, these people would most likely all vote in favour. It took a lot of work to get the EU parliament to really look at what they were voting on and consider the implications. It turned out well this time and I'm really glad, but we never should've needed this campaign to start with. And that makes this image a prime example of the incompetence, maybe even hypocrisy, of the EU parliament.","{'Sadness': 0.047328, 'Anger': 0.99184, 'Analytical': 0.043, 'Emotional_Range': 0.877, 'Tentative': 0.663, 'Joy': 0.045251, 'Disgust': 0.389745, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.069, 'Fear': 0.051766, 'Openness': 0.261, 'Extraversion': 0.714, 'Agreeableness': 0.565}"

Edit: The African Lynx shown has been determined to be actually a Caracal, also known as a desert lynx.

What are you doing in the wild!?Intrusion into Canada Lynx habitat was the pretext ELF used to burn down the Two Elk Lodge at the Vail Ski Resort in 1998. Vail was expanding their terrain into designated Lynx habitat for what became Blue Sky Basin. I wrote an analysis of the Environmental Impact Statement in graduate school where I concluded that while the expansion wasn't a very reasonable plan, that no Canada Lynx had been seen in Colorado in 30 years and none were ever likely to be seen again.

I think I speak for all photographers when I say that people should make an effort to link to the original pages images come from rather than screengrabbing them for imgur. I'm a student/freelancer, and quality photography is seriously a LOT more work than what you perceive in the time it takes you to enjoy the image.

I guess somebody wouldn't know the difference unless they were a painter- but it's still nice work.Looks shitty, but I guess it'll look better when its done....:)At which point the commissioner put the painting on an easel in their home out in the open so it looked as though they were the one painting it when having guests over.I think it's absolutely amazing, but, and not trying to be a dick, just being a little bit critical here (I'm an artist myself, most of my work focuses on photorealism) when upon first glance something seemed a bit off. Upon further inspection, I realized that what was bothering me about the picture was that the horses eye is much too large. Look up any pictures of horses and you'll see what I mean. 

I'm not trying to downplay your sisters ability by any stretch of the imagination, because it really is an amazing work of art. Just wanted to throw my two cents in.Doesn't that just mean that she starts painting a horse and turns it in when it's half done?Very nice. She's really doing a great job with the saddle. The colors are very vivid.  Also, on a side note I think Arabian horses are a beautiful breed. I like the shadows under the penciled in areas.  Even though I don't think it's something you'd really see in a work-in-progress it works in creating the feel that's what is going on. Here's mine.

[Cakewrecks](http://www.cakewrecks.com/) is full of hilarious btwA friend of mine got a cigarette burn-hole in a suit coat, here in Dubai, and went to a nearby reputable Hindi tailor to have an identical coat made - she loved the style that much. 

After explaining the problem and negotiating the price, the tailor asked, ""same-same?"" and she replied, ""same-same.""   She got back an exact copy of the coat, perfect in every respect - including a neatly sewn hole where the burn-hole was.I visited the reception at a hotel to use their printing service. 

I had a pdf stored on my phone that i wanted to print. I emailed their reception desk the pdf. 

First time round, she printed off the email that contained the pdf link. Second time round she printed a screenshot of the browser that contained the pdf (was a dropbox link). 

When i told her that she wasnt giving me what i asked for, she insisted that she did. 

I still had to pay for the prints she had already done. In the end i gave up getting her to understand. 


The kicker: English WAS her first language. Is it such a digital age, that no one prints a picture anymore?

*punctuation ""Can you take the picture off that?""  "" U want me to make picture of that? Ok ok I make picture of that.""Funny development...

Okay, I'm not good at puns. Why is somebody with limited English skills being placed in a position to take custom orders? That's not fair to the employee or the customers.

EDIT - Aw Jeezus .. the Reddit PC patrol found me. It's racist to suggest that people working in customer service should be able to communicate effectively with the customers.

""FUUUUUCKKKK""There was an equally embarrassing cock-up in Houston last year. The city had a big concert at an outdoor theatre (think a covered stage with partially covered seating). The last piece before the fireworks started was the 1812 overture and the city of Houston spared no expense in getting some cannons as percussion. Somehow the person in charge of using the cannons as counterpoint fucked up and missed the first half-dozen shots. To compensate they just fired all the cannons at once at the wrong time, scaring the shit out of everyone who though the cannons were just for show. The fireworks were nice though.I've lived in San Diego for most of my life and the ONE TIME I'm not in town for the 4th of July, the fireworks create some massive spectacle. R.I.P. unlucky bird.

please confirm that this note is from your landlord.  someone at the senior apartment complex that my mother stays at did this as a prank and many people who were on fixed incomes did indeed buy extra things and had a hard time paying the next month's rent.  never hurts to be safe.

They are a multi million dollar company, and it is entirely doable, but they would never give anything to anyone.

It cost a buck to use the copy machine, per page.My boss who isn't well off kept his old 3 flat in Chicago. He always makes it a tradition to provide December rent free and has never thought anything of it. Unfortunately his former tenant was past due and extended his gift for another 7 months before he could be evicted. He still keeps this tradition even to this day. Needless to say this is a great man to work for and his sacrifice of a months rent has been a blessing for the people renting from him. He is the good kind of Christian.  $70! do you know how much booze and hookers that could buy?!
...I just thought of an incredible prank...Are there any openings in your building?I'm a landlord and I give my tenants free rent for December. The only thing I collect is utilities. Every little bit counts this time of year and so I'm glad to be able to take some of the pressure off.God how I love the word monies.I was actually thinking about posting the same topic the other day.  We're struggling financial right now and our car blew its head gasket. Piece of shit civic. My landlord owns a small mechanic shop and offered to fix it for just the price of parts. There are still good people left in the world. I like it when landlords do this.  My old landlord actually did this whole ordeal about popping a balloon when it's about time to renew your lease and you can get anywhere from $100-$500 off any month's rent of your choice for the year.  I chose December and was able to get my daughter the toys I would have not been able to afford that year.Don't ever move out of there.brohonestly, here's $70 bucksThis is incredible! It's so great to see loyalty and good renters rewarded with tokens, even if it was only $70. But to me, $70 pays my cell phone bill. You should buy your landlord a small gift in return!This blows my mind. Every landlord I've ever had has cared about one thing and that is getting as much money from me as possible by whatever means.Fauke, Arkansas = Good Guy

San Francisco, California = Cheap BastardI just emailed this to my landlord. Awaiting response. What a nice landlord! We need more awesome people like that.Little shit like this goes a long way....

Hope you're enjoying your flying cars and remembering to take your food pills! Can't wait to meet you!

Sincerely,  
The 1950sAccording to Star Trek, I believe that would be [New Berlin](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/New_Berlin). Apparently we will be living there in 57 years.From what I've heard we will most likely colonize the poles, as they will see a steadier temperature.Futurology is superstition and hokum.

Futuronomy is where the *real* science happens.New Zealand is on the moon?Hopefully by then we will be using something more efficient than sodium vapor lights.  

I predict that in my lifetime sodium vapor lights will fall out of use in the united states and people will reminisce over the golden-hued nightscapes.[Actually, thanks to time travel, we know this is what our view of the moon will be.](http://i.imgur.com/a6UKU.jpg)That image really tweaked me for a moment there. I have never really considered that level of population to be likely, despite absolutely loving [The Moon is a Harsh Mistress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_is_a_Harsh_Mistress).That's no moon, it's a space station!I feel like people are not understanding the awesomeness that is this image.

Whether or not it is possible, it is still an amazing thought. Yet we will never know what is to come in the far future.Nope. A large population on the moon would be impractical and wouldn't be worth the expenses. It's basically a very hot and extremely cold desert with no atmosphere that you have to spend billions of dollars to move resources 384,400 km to and from.

In the future It might be good for research or just a tourism place for the extremely wealthy but that will probably be it. 

...that was oddly pessimistic.Isn't the moon just a barren rock though? I can't imagine having to live there being anything desirable. I mean, the novelty of ""Yeah bitch, living on the moooooon"" can't last an entire lifetime of having to resort to living in a contained environment, completely dependent of outside sources and under constant threat of imminent death upon any sizable malfunction. Given from what I understand, the moon doesn't have an impacting atmosphere, it wouldn't even do a proper job at thwarting debris, making living there even more of a gamble. Maybe I'm just overthinking it.Not without Gingrich. (I'm with Newt, 2012).First thought, ""that would be cool.""  That would be a spectacular sightMore likely it will be a giant McDonald's logo. ""Our"" view? I doubt it. Somebody's, someday? I like to think so.Wow, awesome.THAT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOMEWait until Handsome Jack shows up...That's no moon...We're whalers on the Moon  
We carry a harpoon.  
But there ain't no whales  
So we tell tall tales  
And sing our whaling tuneZarquon: Looks like the mad ape infection has spread to another globe.

Snorq: initiate supernova bomb!Why would you ever want to live on the moon?  Dirty, cold, shitty, no trees, nothing even to mine, except helium 3 and dirt.  I can understand putting radio telescopes on the far side, but as for the rest of it, ew.Maybe if we had built on Neil Armstrong's achievement and kept going there regularly we'd have *something* up there by now.

He goes ""$100 a night, if that's too much...$75"". If the place was rested to tourists it would have been $1500 a night at least. Man that's a good story.

And yes it was a great smoke spotI read the title in an Australian accent. This is the Ladera Resort, St. Lucia! I stayed in one of these suites for about 5 days in 2007.. Stayed a few days before hand at the Sandals Resort, then rented a car and drove to this beautiful place! This was the same year as Hurricane Dean, which had just passed near St. Lucia the day we were checking into this resort. We had to wait for hours and hours in the lobby while they waited for new mattresses to arrive... Since there are only three walls to these rooms, the hurricane basically trashed everything. In the bar we spoke to people who had to hide under the beds and in the bathrooms while the hurricane passed by the island.

Was a pretty amazing resort, I have dreams about going again. :) This is a terrible balcony... mostly because it's not a balcony. If you really wanted to classify the structure, it's a modified veranda, if anything.At first i thought to myself, gee i want that balcony...and then i remembered im Australian and the amount of nope that would visit me would probably kill me in the space of 20 seconds of setting foot on that balconyNow THIS is a repost!Anyone seeking more info might also check here:

You should post this to /r/PerfectTiming 

This is milliseconds from death for most if not all of those men. What puzzles me about the world these days. Is the blatant and utter disregard for life. Life is so precious. Its so beautiful. No matter which path your fall upon, it belongs to you. The one thing we are given and no one should take away from us.

They were for a moment, maybe talking about their lives, or family, their future in a war torn country where it seems all anyone wants to do is take the life of the so called enemy. And the next moment, they are radioed a possible threat that could take them away from their loved ones, and then death.

In those seconds, and captured in this sequence, we witness what birth, life, and death really is. And no one could of imagined it would be so quick.

Anyone willing to end the lives of their brothers or sisters, neighbors or friends, or just mankind, should not be so quick about it; for we all die eventually, but should never so violently.I am staggered by the ocean of words this conveys. This picture says everything about modern war. Everything. 

From the distilled imagery of the unsuspecting combatants, already dead without knowing yet, to the way the burst wave submerges their silhouette. This picture says to me ""This is confidence, before broken"", it says to me ""This is the breath of death, haunting the air that you heave."" From the way the man in red braces his comrade for the shot he'll never take, to the way the lone survivor collapses in realization. Without ever having to be there, we are all that survivor. But he carries a burden we do not, a weight this image won't carry.

This picture tells me everything I need to know of war. That before you arrive, you are dead. That before you can fire, your gun is empty. That before the enemy arrives, they've been there the whole time.

This picture breaks my heart.Freedom is bought not with the lives of anonymous soldiers, but paid for with the lives of 

Brothers

Sons

And the tears of mothersWhat a profound series of photos.  Makes me think how trivial the perceived problems in my life really are.  Thanks for posting this OP.Damn, shows you how much we take for granted in the western world, these are ordinary people fighting for their freedom. Right in the feels man, right in the feels.Very profound set.Holy shit, this is a crazy photo and the whole album is even crazier.

Astonishing. That he which hath no stomach to this fight, 
  Let him depart; his passport shall be made, 
  And crowns for convoy put into his purse; 
  We would not die in that man's company 
  That fears his fellowship to die with us. 
  This day is call'd the feast of Crispian. 
  He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, 
  Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd, 
  And rouse him at the name of Crispian. 
  He that shall live this day, and see old age, 
  Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, 
  And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.' 
  Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars, 
  And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.' 
  Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, 
  But he'll remember, with advantages, 
  What feats he did that day. Then shall our names, 
  Familiar in his mouth as household words- 
  Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, 
  Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester- 
  Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red. 
  This story shall the good man teach his son; 
  And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, 
  From this day to the ending of the world, 
  But we in it shall be remembered- 
  We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; 
  For he to-day that sheds his blood with me 
  Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, 
  This day shall gentle his condition; 
  And gentlemen in England now-a-bed 
  Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here, 
  And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks

Something should also be done about condensation. Maybe make a wood carriage for the gutter?As someone who has a picnic table in my kitchen, thank you.Why am I just now realizing this?I wonder if you'd add a plug in the large hole in the bottom of an end piece of gutter so you could drain it when the ice melted.

I think it paid around $15 dollars a game, and was a pretty cool job for a 12 year old.  Doing two games a night and having it be tax free was great at that age.    

So one week I got the opportunity to umpire a game for the kids who were just one year younger than I was.  They almost never let this happen as you sort of lose that aura of authority when you are umpiring for kids who are just about as big as you.  But they must have been short on people that day so they let me do it.  I was pretty confident in myself, and the game paid better than the other ones so I thought why not? How bad could it be?

Just my luck the two best teams in the league were playing each other, and each teams coach was your very typical type A, macho, jock of a guy who takes baseball games between kids 10 years old uber seriously.  It didn't help that the coaches had a huge rivalry too.  

I didn't know about the teams, or the coaches, or any of this going in, but it became apparent right from the start that I was going to have a really, really bad time umpiring that game...

From the first inning until the end of the game, comments were made about my strike zone, calls were contested, I was yelled at and berated for ""bad"" calls, and generally treated like shit.  Both teams had really good pitching, and they were throwing really hard and fast.  The whole game was much faster than I was used to. It made it even tougher for one so inexperienced as me to get my calls right consistently. Needless to say the game was a disaster.  

When it was over I walked down to the end of the fence and cried. One of the coaches eventually came over and said he was sorry for being a douche.  It didn't help because I hated my job after that game.   I played baseball my entire life, until politics took over and I got tired of the high school bullshit. Too many times have parents ruined games by taking them too seriously. These rules need to be everywhere. When I was 8, my soccer team was scrimmaging and one of the coaches was playing on the other team because the teams were uneven. The next thing I know, he's 5 yards in front of me, facing me, and kicking the ball like he's Lionel Fucking Messi right into my face. When I came to, there was blood everywhere and my dad was screaming into the coaches face.  

So yeah, never forget that children's sports are nothing more than fun and games. That's when people get hurt. YOU! IN THE OUTFIELD, WAY TO PICK THAT GRASS OUT OF THE GROUND CHAMP!There are so many signs that could easily be replaced with one that reads:

""Don't be an asshole""I coached little league baseball one season and I was absolutely shocked that I had no run ins with parents.  I had one dad approach me and say, ""First off, thank you for all you do.  Secondly I feel my son might not be playing as much as other people on the team.""  I explained that the coach who schedules playing time tracks it and one game is 4 innings another is 3 innings.  The dad said he makes it to half the games so he might only make it to the 3.  Thanked us again and said he is happy as long as someone is tracking and trying to get close to even playing time. 

We also ended up winning the championship when the worst hitter on the team had one of his two hits all season for a walk off single.   It was seriously a made for tv situation.

I more wanted to coach that year after the years of playing with my dad as a coach and not setting a good example.   I used to umpire girls softball, kindergardeners and first graders. The parents would RAGE over the stupidest things. We didn't keep score, but the parents sure did. I was once asked if we could re-do a play because his daughter wasn't ready. Come to a Canadian minor league hockey game and check out some of the parents.  It's our quiet shame.

Canada's reputation could be severely tarnished.*Hey Bat Dad, I didn't hear no bell.*The funniest are when parents don't know the rules to a sport and start shouting out completely nonsensical things that show off their lack of understanding. Like cheering for your kid to score when he plays defense, or complaining about foul calls without knowing what's a foul and what's a clean defensive play.These are good, but needs one more (a bit more verbose).  ""These are volunteers.  If you are not volunteering for the same job, then you should be grateful rather than critical.""I prefer [this one](http://i.imgur.com/M5s2T.jpg)I dunno... it was a lot of fun throwing a 40something coach out of the game as a 16 year old umpire. I played little league baseball on a military base growing up. Even when we did tournaments off base everyone's parents were really nice. I can't remember anything mean said. 

Looking back... the fact that every kid's dad on our team was a marine probably helped keep people civil. I don't know how bad the parents are in the US but i don't know if anyone compares to Canadian hockey parents. Watching my dad's boss's son play hockey (he now plays for Cornell) was a little scary being in the stands. I think I would have rather taken my chances on the iceMy first job was little league ump when I was 14. I got into it with one parent so bad that they had to separate us. He was screaming at the kids so badly that I simply couldn't take it anymore. I told him to quiet down, he didn't so I told him that the league allows me to have people removed for this kind of behavior. He actually got in my face, and other parents had to remove him.

I was a pretty big 14 year old, good chance he thought I was older, but still.Oh I'm sorry, I thought this was America.I tried to watch a game of my nephew's little, like, YMCA basketball team once. He was maybe ten. Barely two kids on the team could even throw the ball high enough to come NEAR the hoop, and clearly the coaches just wanted everyone to have fun and get moving. 

That didn't stop the parents from spending the entire game shrieking their heads off and pounding their feet against the bleachers (making an UNGODLY racket.) At one point my sister and I just started yelling ""Everyone please just have fun!"" It was so embarrassing. When I have kids I'd like to put them in organized sports for the exercise and experience, but damn, not if I have to put up with parents like that. When I was in little league the head guy in our local organization was kicked out for threatening to ""kick my fucking teeth down my throat"". He thought we were booing (we were yelling ""Ruth"")
Ogden, UT born n' raised!
Shout out to Ogden, UT.  I see you.I crossed this line this year at one of my daughter's volleyball tournaments (7th Grade).  The scorekeepers were two high school girls who were more interested in talking, eating, and texting than they were in paying attention to the referees.  Several parents I wasn't even near were getting upset as well.  My daughter's team lost the championship game due to multiple scoring errors and I just had to say something to the referee after the game.  I wasn't raging or anything but I let my opinion be known and I still felt like a huge asshole later because it's uncharacteristic for me.Oh god I used to deal with horror parents all the time:

I used to ""coach"" a dual soccer/teeball league for seven year olds in the summer (soccer on tuesday, teeball on thursday). The focus was on having a good time and making sure everyone was included. If they learned some fundamentals and rules of the games, that was just a bonus. No score was kept and no outs were counted in teeball--one team's turn to bat was over when all the players got a chance to hit.

One parent decided this wasn't good enough. He was an over-the-hill  jock that you could tell wanted to relive the glory days through his seven year old son. He was a giant of a man with huge muscles that would usually drop his son off and then go quick work out at the gym down the street. When he returned, he brought back a massive protein shake and a short temper as well. He saw it as his personal mission to make sure that his son's team ""won"" and to inform the other seven year olds as much.

On the last day of the ""season"" he skipped his workout and brought his own scoreboard (who owns a scoreboard?)  to the game with him. Halfway through the game he started to heckle the kids on the other team, shouting sarcastic praises like ""Way to ground out Brandon!"" or ""Nice foul ball Ashley!"". When I asked him to tone it down, he got a little bit mad with me and got pouty. 

He kept it down for an ""inning"" before he started heckling seven-year-old children and their parents. ""Hey blue team, you're losing!"", ""Leave it to Kevin to strike out in teeball!"" and ""Hey Roy, your son swings worse than the girls on the team!"". After two minutes of this I stopped the game and told him that either he left now or I would end the game and call the cops.

He decided to take his heckling to the other side of the road, convinced that it was okay to heckle fucking SEVEN_YEAR OLDS as long as he wasn't on park property. He continued to keep score and shout at the game from far away. I called my supervisor and one of the parents called the police, but there was only ten minutes left of ""game time"" so unfortunately the cops didn't get there before the game was up.

During those ten long minutes, his son was visibly embarrassed by his dad and the other kids started to be affected by the screaming of the dad. One kid broke down in tears and ran to his parents after the dad heckled him about how far he hit the ball. (WHO IS OKAY WITH MAKING KIDS CRY?!?)

The dad kept keeping score and oddly enough found that his son's team was losing at the end of the game, so after it was all done, he came to me and tried to bribe me to ""change the score"" of a game that WE DIDN'T EVEN KEEP SCORE OF. He insisted that his son needed to win the championship and that getting a trophy meant the world to his kid. 

I tried to explain that every player got a trophy and that we didn't even keep score, but he persisted in trying to bribe me, so I decided that I would take his money and use it towards the end-of-the-summer ice cream party for the kids. ""Ok"" I said, ""How much will you give me to change the score?"" He stopped and pondered for a moment and said ""About tree-fiddy."" I was surprised, but then I realized that this giant angry dad was actually a 30-foot high monster from the paleozoic era. ""Aww, lochness monster, I ain't taking no tree-fiddy! Get out of here!"" He scurried away back into the lake just as the cops showed up, so they never got to arrest him. The next year when he tried to sign his kid up again, we refused to let him or his son back.

Nothing infuriated me more than terrible parents, especially in a league for SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS that DIDN'T EVEN KEEP SCORE. 

tl;dr: Worst dad ever--I really wish we had one of these signs at the park I worked at.

What I love about this is that it's an absurd answer, but it's probably completely accurate. As much as that kid likes cows, she probably likes her parents more.My Mom has kept some birthday cards I made for her as a child. This is so precious, hold on to it. Then you can show it to her and embarrass her when she is older. I too, love cow.In college I was a preschool teaching assistant in a snobby preschool at an elite university. One of the 4-year-olds was the child of two robotics professors and had a practically robotic autistic brain. He didn't really like other kids and *hated* the other teachers but for whatever reason he liked me.

On my last day there he told me he was going to make me a going-away present. So I watched him sit in the corner, tape a bunch of sheets of paper together and proceed to write a TON of stuff on them. It turns out he had written me an exhaustive list of all of the wars the US has been involved in, the years they took place and the number of casualties involved. He created this from memory and was so excited to give it to me. 

Let me tell you, that is a pretty unforgettable gift!I love you more than **cow**.  I can't tell you how much the voice in which I read **cow** brightened my day.The body of a cow, the head of Dobby the house-elf.in kindergarten we were tasked with drawing our family. i drew my mom, myself, and me. i made my dad taller than everyone, since he's 6'4"". i drew elaborate clouds and trees, and attempted to draw a house. it was a shitty house because i was only 5 and couldn't draw.

oh, and i gave everyone in the picture dicks (including my mom). it was a comical parent/teacher conference, so my mom tells me.  That cow looks so sheepish. Like, ""Hey, I know it's kind of a silly comparison, but it could be worse, right? I'm pretty cool. She means well. I'm just here. Enjoy your card, nice lady.""I just flashed back to the end of Earthworm Jim 2.

A machine that can see your bones?Having trouble finding the perfect gift for the heroin addict that has everything?When I told my wife the phlebotomist about this post she stated "" that thing is for pussies and is an insult""Knowing my luck with nurses they'll use this and still miss the vein 3 times.Put it over your dick.....So will that add $300-500 to every ER visit now?The future is fucking awesome.My experience with those things is that they SUCK. It seems to show tendons and other anatomical structures. Plus unlike a good ED nurse/paramedic it can't show you sclerosed veins, bad at showing valves and definitely can't tell you about veins lacking good subcutaneous tissue to anchor them.

Flashy technology, but far from an acceptable substitute for a good human.This thing is a neat gadget, but I don't believe it is any better than conventional ways of placing IVs.

By the way, what is the cost of this device? Google says it's $10,000-$20,000. You can buy an ultrasound machine for a little more than that and truly be able to see every vein, in addition to examine every other part of the body. Basically, this device is a one trick pony and a waste of money.
As an ER nurse I use this thing daily, such a life saver.That's cool but you had to say first post so I have to reply with MAN FUCK YO FIRST POSTIf this really works, this is a miracle for me! My veins are extremely difficult to find and they shift...never fails they end up sticking me at least four times before they get anything and my veins are always blown afterwards...nothing like walking around with nice dark bruises on my extremely pale arms. I've even had to have an IV in my foot before because my veins are so difficult. I saw one of these a couple of years ago at a science museum in my university town. It was very impressive, but the detection didn't work too well on people with darker skin.Both! And yes the idea was discussed but realistically you shouldn't have any trouble finding those veins....The reprojecting thing is definitely a great idea for the medical field, but for anyone who just likes seeing the veins you can do this fairly easily with a webcam, an IR LED, and maybe an IR pass filter to help block out unneeded visible light (for instance, the black plastic at the end of a Wii Remote. [To illustrate](http://i.imgur.com/gage3Rh.png).At your work, or working?

OR BOTH!?Put... Put your dick under it.Plot twist: OP works at a heroin rehab center.I was a phlebotomist for three and a half years. So here's where I say ""Vein finder? You mean index finger?"" ...but for real, this is great.[deleted][deleted]What kind of sorcery is this?You're so Vein, you probably think this post is about you, dont you?

I am a beekeeper, have been for some time, and my family sells only raw, unpasterized honey.  We also sell honey comb (as referenced in this photo), beeswax, as well as starter colonies for other beekeepers.

First - if you buy pure, raw, honey from a local source, and it has bee parts and other pieces of wax, etc., in it, I would suggest you take it back and ask for a refund.  Bees are incredible tiddy and clean creatures, and they do not store honey in the honey comb with anything other than pollen.  Bee parts and bits of wax are from thieving part of the honey extraction process, and any beekeeper worth a hoot that is selling product to the public will run the honey through a double mesh strainer to get all of the junk out of the honey.

Pollen grains will still pass through, so you still get the great benefits of raw honey, but no one wants bee parts and bits of wax in their honey.

Secondly, there is currently no federally mandated definition as to what is ""honey.""  Several states in the US, including the state I am in (Nebraska) do have locally mandated definitions of ""honey"" - but unscrupulous beehavers in other parts of the world, namely China, will adulterate honey from other sources with sugar water, corn syrup, and other sweetners as honey is much more valuable per pound than any of those other sweetners.

On top of that, several in-hive pesticides are used in countries other than the US to control bee parasites, and these pesticides are very dangerous to humans.  As honey from foreign sources are not tested upon entry to the US, and there is no nationally recognized honey definition, any honey from a big-box store can be suspect.  It may not be honey at all.  And if it is honey, and not from North America (Canada has similar pesticide restrictions on beekeeping), the honey may actually be dangerous by US standards.

Hope this clears up a few things.Honey comb tastes about twice as good as normal honey.Curious, how was the milk served?[Meanwhile, outside the hotel](http://i.imgur.com/Fginy.jpg)This is done at good hotels all over Asia.[Not the bees!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1vrd0OgLG1rsxmo8o1_400.gif)That's the way honey should bee served.Dat honeycomb

Is it supposed to be human-readable? I would have just made the whole display one color and cycled through red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and white.[deleted]ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOADBroadcast television engineer of almost 20yrs here. While its true that's it's not a standard pattern but its still a viable pattern. More than likely it was generated specifically for that display and that aspect ratio. Large displays like that are made of individual modules that are addressable and made into a grid pattern that an image processor splits into seperate streams and serves to each module. Now each module needs calibration not only in color but in horitizontal and vertical alignment. Back in the early days each module needed to be manually adjusted which would have a guy on the back side doing adjustments while a guy on the front yelled out what to adjust. Today you can point a camera at the display and you run several patterns and the camera processes the image and makes the adjustments on the processor side. These adjustments need to be done on a regular basis. 

This is what should always be on the billboardsGray.  Damnit.

Fantastic hack idea.  Run ""Milkdrop"" from Winamp through highway billboards.  I don't think this is a test.  There's a Duane Reade right up the street that alternates this effect between advertisements.  I think it's just doing something cool with a really high quality billboard.

I also hope this particular billboard is new, because I've walked by this corner 5 days a week for two years and never noticed it.  Then again, that American Eagle was a shoe store (FootAction?) up until a couple weeks ago...

They had a large, heavy stone below the front door that after many years was starting to wear down a tad in the center and catch rain. They decided to flip it over to get maybe another hundred or so years out of it. After some very hard labor the stone was finally turned over. However, someone many years ago had obviously experienced the same problem and had already flipped it. It's from Norway.

ET phone homeI would climb up and sit the fuck outta that rockActually, that rock may not represent the high tide mark.  Instead, it could represent the low-tide mark of 132,000 years ago- when sea levels were several meters higher during the last interglacial.  Like [here](http://i.imgur.com/y5nJpcg.jpg).  Bioerosion/chemical erosion occurs below the low-tide mark where the rock is constantly submerged.

Notice the lack of barnacles/seaweed on the rocks-perhaps indicating this picture is already at high tide.

It's just there, weathering away, decade after decade.
Hundreds of years and maybe a large tide moves it a few feet. 
Thousands of years later it just becomes sand. Nothing more, nothings less. 
Over thousands of years, ten, even hundreds of thousands, the sand is compressed.
New rock is formed. Maybe one day it reaches the surface again.

And there was a little podium thing, and I suppose the official speech had not yet started, but Sauli Niinistö (he who was elected new persident) was there chilling, and I just pointed him out and explained to my Ugandian friend that ""that's possibly our new president on sunday!"". We just walked past and carried on, but his face was priceless, when I explained to him that no it was not a joke, that's actualy a famous politician and yes he was just standing around casualy in the middle of the mall.

What does that mean?

It's a measure of how people with high power/reputation and low power/reputation people interact with each other and how they behave around each other.

Countries with low power Distance index high power people tend to be close with their employees or other low power people and do what normal people do. Like Finland 

Countries with high power Distance index are the opposite of the low power index. Like north Korea where high power people are greeted with bows and treated like kings.

A lot of people in the west have very little idea about the amazing art, culture, and architecture in Iran.

Rick Steves, who hosts travel shows on PBS (""Rick Steve's Europe"" is his most popular), did a fantastic series where he traveled to Iran, maybe a year ago or so.  I was really surprised to see the beautiful buildings he visited, the incredible Mosques, etc.  So many people he spoke with spoke perfect English.  The cities looked gorgeous, and the people seemed really friendly and welcoming.  He even traveled the into the countryside as well.

Not that their leadership is that great, but the series was still very enlightening and balanced.  Much different than what I expected to see in Iran.Look, a bank in Iran:

Noon, the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us. He swung in low and he saw us... he was a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper. Anyway, he saw us and he come in low, and three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and starts to pick us up. 

You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again.

So, eleven hundred men went in the water, 316 men come out, and the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945. 

Anyway... we delivered the bomb. What is the camera strapped to? Once you enter the water you become part of the food chain.[deleted]I've been waiting over a year for this moment.I call bullshit.  

NY in January with no booties?  Nope.  

Under what circumstances surfing would that camera be pointed like that except to shoot perfectly for some Photoshop?
Was the camera on his friends head and he's about to take a fin to the face?  

As a surfer, I call shenanigans.  Also, if this is real...fuck.   

EDIT:  my bad, didn't see the October bit, so...I dunno.  Still seems convoluted though.  its funny to see people that don't live near the ocean terrified of this..this pic is scary don't get me wrong, but, i was born & raised in Hawaii & basically grew up in the water, there are sharks in the water with you all the time, thats just the way it is. i know it sounds crazy but if you wanna surf you have to know this fact. you have more of a chance dying from a coconut falling on your head anyway..& i know some of the people commenting on this pic are cig smokers, to me, thats 100% more terrifying than this, you're WILLINGLY killing yourself everyday, ahhh people...It's a bag of Doritos.That's so cool! I wonder how close to the beach they can get. I remember the good ol days when my fam and I lived in Brooklyn and went swimming to Rockaway Beach.

Is that a dog shark? I'm honestly not sure if that type of shark even exists, I remember someone telling me that that's the common shark in the area. This was when a shark took some poor dudes bait in the Verrazano bridge area. He ended up having the FDNY giving him a hand getting it out with their long hook thing.

Pretty cool times for a 7 year old. Brooklyn was the shit. 

I'm so baked right now and this brought back a lot of memories... hard times and now I'm sitting here crying after the 1st link I click on reddit after getting home.

[deleted]To those who might wonder why some people consider this trite, an
explanation:

The color palette used in this work, and apparently everything else
this artist does, consists solely of store-bought paints. In other
words, there is no mixing done, no ""let's add a little green to this
yellow and get the *exact* shade I need"", on display here. Color
mixing, and color selection, is a hallmark of a mature painter. So is
selecting colors based on theme  and subject matter, but he always
uses the same colors, so there's very little 'selection' going on.

I won't say there's *no* talent on display here, but to the seasoned
eye, it's obvious he's cranking things out with little regard to the
needs of the individual work. Some people like it. For that matter,
some artists make ""cranking things out"" a statement about the culture
of mass consumption--but I don't think that's what he's doing here.

To each his own, but now you know why some of us don't regard this
work quite so highly.You can buy [knock-offs on ebay](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Leonid-Afremov-Misty-Mood-Rain-Park-Original-Oil-Painting-Canvas-/400320326735?pt=Art_Paintings&hash=item5d34f36c4f) that say they're the real deal with a certificate and everything, but the artist, Leonid Afremov, has stated that [he only sells off his own website](http://fineartamerica.com/blogs/dont-buy-my-art-from-ebay.html).

edit: spellingI've been following his [Deviantart](http://leonidafremov.deviantart.com) for a long time. [Here's](http://fav.me/d3dddwt) one of my favorites.Using only a repost. No O.C.I want to give my thoughts on Leonid Afremov, as I have bought a painting through his website.

Firstly, the painting I received was beautiful and I'm quite happy with it. 

However, a few issues I take with the site. I do not believe that Leonid Afremov is actually painting his cheap auctions as the website states. The originals that sell for $1000 or more are painted by his hand, but the painted reproductions are most likely being created by art students out of Mexico. (Most of his paintings ship from Mexico). This isn't uncommon in the art world, to have a mass production of art using the style of the artist. I had a friend who worked for a famous artists making art in a specific style, and the artist would sell it as made by herself. 

In addition the mail-by date is automated, so even though you get an email stating that the item has been shipped, you may or may not see movement on the tracker until weeks afterwards. I recieved my painting about 3 weeks after expected delivery date.

The website itself is clunky, and if you make orders in firefox chances are it'll fail. I would recommend making orders in IE.

Just some things to think about if you plan on buying. Again, very pleased with the final product I received.From beginning to end - http://youtu.be/noaO5SBypY8I actually bought a painting from this guy....the whole ordeal was a mess. This guy does not live in the United States, and shipping is a bitch. In total, it took me 2.5 months to get my order....I'd been told several times that the painting had been shipped, when it hadn't. The email seems to be handled by the painter himself, but shipping it handled by someone completely different. Now I actually did receive my painting on canvas, but the wood they used to create the frame is warped as well, and as such, it doesn't sit flat on my wall. I love the painting, and I'm glad I did actually receive it, but I'm not sure I'd go through the ordeal that I did again just to get another one. Be warned.I'm not gonna pretend this is an original work (because it's not), but my mom noticed this was my desktop and off-handedly asked who the artist was because it looked neat. Told her, and fast forward 8 months to Christmas when she gave me [this](http://i.imgur.com/SWqWO.jpg)!

Apparently found a website that does quality prints of whatever image you wanted. Not too shabby as a poster in my room!
the $139 items are him re-painting one of his already sold originals. I'm assuming he sold the originals for a lot more. If this is the case, then this is a very good deal on beautiful artwork, especially since most of them are 100cm in length and it offers 'free shipping to anywhere'.

What I don't get is why it claims ""Any painting with Afremov signature is sold for thousands of dollars in a retail gallery no matter if it was the first or second version"". Most of these painting have an ""Gallery estimated value"" of over $3000 dollars. WTF does that even mean?[deleted][deleted]That's one of my husband's favorite ~~paintings~~ knifings (?). That is Leonid Afremov, I have a couple of his paintings in my office. I was shocked to see this on Reddit. The guy is brilliant with colors. He has a great profile on Deviant Art. Here it is, check out all of his work. http://leonidafremov.deviantart.com/tacky....they sell stuff like that at the fair accept its a matador My  name is Jessilyn Park, and I actually flew to Mexico to learn this technique from Leonid. Those of you that are saying this is a print or that it's too cheap, you are wrong. This guy seriously paints amazing pictures very quickly. When you are buying from his site, www.afremov.com you are buying from him and his sons directly. No I don't work for him, no I don't get kickbacks. I genuinely know him and his family.  This is commercial art, which is fine; it's primarily decorative household stuff that usually is sold in malls or on tv. Please do not think you are getting an original. This type of stuff is usually mass produced in places like china and Mexico. They print out on canvas the original version and art factories apply paint to them. It is actually relatively easy to paint in this style. They can still sell them for thousands of dollars since they are technically paintings. They also sign them. It's not illegal. Anything in the 100s is usually a print, which is a higher quality poster. Some prints have screened textures on them which can make it difficult to tell if you are not familiar with prints that is actually not a painting. Sorry if this comment comes off as too negative; but I urge you to purchase art from local artists from your own community.  I find this guy's type of ""art"" on par with scams and it harms the small fragile art economy.I got this as a free wallpaper on my iphone from one of the 1000+ free wallpaper apps...As many have said before, and will say again, it's not about the tools so much as it's about the person using them.ORANGE and BLUE!!!I've purchased his paintings which are 'real' reproductions by the artist of the originals.   They are not as good.    They are close but they lack  the effort and detail that went into the ones you see.I bought a painting from Afremov off his website for the $140 or so for my girlfriend's birthday.  It is not a cheap print, took a [photo here](http://imgur.com/XCZDr), you can see the texture of the paint on the canvas.  Spent another $200 or so on the frame but the painting itself was remarkably higher quality than any ""print"" I've purchased in the past.There is a reason why you can only find this guys work on places like etsy and amazon and not in art galleries.","{'Sadness': 0.096802, 'Anger': 0.581408, 'Analytical': 0.139, 'Emotional_Range': 0.75, 'Tentative': 0.154, 'Joy': 0.518856, 'Disgust': 0.048014, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.198, 'Fear': 0.043229, 'Openness': 0.288, 'Extraversion': 0.557, 'Agreeableness': 0.577}"

From what part of the world do you hail, OP?Quick! Open your wide jacket to appear larger!!My stupid ocelot got sick. Fixed: http://i.imgur.com/mh57t.jpgSo cool! Lynx or bobcats?Relevant advice found elsewhere on reddit:

http://i.imgur.com/cOsSj.jpgI think they need pettings and food, probably should do food first for your own safety.Cool! We have Bobcats all over the place down in Florida as well. They would always eat our geese until we bought this one older female goose that taught them all to sleep while floating in the middle of our pond at night.

[Edit]: Before we got the female half-Chinese half-Toulouse goose, we had a trapper come out and set up some Rooster cage traps to try and catch it/them so they could be relocated. The trap was a wire crate divided into two parts.....one compartment holding a Rooster, the other reserved for the Bobcat. He tried for weeks but never managed to catch anything. I always thought about how shit-your-pants terrifying it would have been to be that rooster, trapped barely six inches away from an extremely hungry Bobcat, with only some rather flimsy looking chicken-wire between.

Additionally, my dad's Yorkshire terrier once chased one of the Bobcats out of the Sawgrass around our pond as it was stalking our geese at about 6am one morning. He never knew the difference between our cat Turbo, and a Bobcat...which is basically 40 lbs of pure muscle with razor claws that could have snapped him in half with one swipe. My dad chopped down all the sawgrass after that. He loved that damn dog. Friggin thing almost got picked up by a Bald Eagle once too......one made a nest in the pasture next door.They're stalking your house for karma. [deleted]Serious Question: How dangerous is it to approach these two?its me, mittens, i brought a friend, let us in.Did you invite them in for tea and scones?

That's what I'd have done.kitties!awww. I want to hug them and kiss them.I used to have a bobcat sleep on my back porch, regularly, when I lived at the base of a very old mountain. I also had a loud, bitchy mouse in the house. I was *so* tempted to coax the cat inside. That damned mouse bitched about no food and avoided my traps. My great-aunt had a bobcat, as a pet, for 20 years. She took him in, after he'd been shot. 

I was under a strict no pet clause, so I never let him in, but I enjoyed talking to ""Bob"" every morning. He slept on my porch for six months. I would open the kitchen door and talk to him, while I made coffee. Eventually, the mouse left through my kitchen door. He was tired of starving. Bob just quit coming to visit. I suspect my neighbor, a quarter of the way around the mountain, shot him.

I would make friends with those two and provide bedding. Maybe food and water for the winter, just to tide them over, until spring. They would disappear, afterwards.

The one on the right looks very worried you're not going to let them in.[deleted]WANT!! :(
they look so sad.. ""won't you please let us in""An anecdote from my childhood.

We had just gotten a new dog from the pound. He was extremely shy, I suspect he had been abused before we got him, so when we first brought him home he sat in one room and wouldn't move until we let him out. We kind of let our dogs free roam around our property because we have enough that they won't leave, and anyone in fear of getting bit is trespassing anyways(has happend before and it wasn't even the dogs fault, another story, long story short stay they fuck off our property). Anyways, we let him out to go piss and shit and do what dogs do and he took off. Every dog does this the first time you let them out, they love to explore, but so long as you have been feeding them they always come back. Anyways, me and my brother were young and kind of worried so we took off to look for him. We were in the back yard calling for him where the lawn meets the tree line and next thing I know I see him jump past my face as a blur in my vision(I was probably around 5 foot then or a couple inches over). I didn't really take in to account that dogs usually don't jump that high, and yelled to my brother who had just seen the whole affair that I saw him and was going after him. My brother started screaming at me to stop and to not go after that. It wasn't my dog but a bobcat had jumped past my inches from my face.

At first I didn't really believe him, but the dog showed up a few minutes later from a different part of the tree line, and my neighbor actually sighted the bobcat a couple days later, so it's pretty much confirmed.

This is one of those stories I tell people and they never believe me, but my brother remembers it, and I definitely remember the blur crossing past my vision into the woods. I came inches within getting my head attacked by a bobcat and lived. I kind of wish it had hit me though so then I would have a cooler story.The part of my brain that says ""ohh look at the kitty...here kitty kitty kitty"" and the part that want's to keep my hand would be fighting...hard. My cousin lives in a rural forest area in AZ. One day she heard crying under her porch and to her amazement, found 2 baby bobcats. She let them be but after almost 2 days there was no sign of the mother. She set up a gamecam to be sure, after a full day there was no sign of her. She didn't want to call the animal shelter because she knew they would just put them to sleep. She took them into there house to take care of them, at this point they were probably a few days old. Around 5 years later she still has them and they go in and out of the house through a dog door. They also get along with her cats and are best friends with the dog. It's pretty fucking cool. They are the coolest cats ever. They even sleep, cuddle, and play just like a normal house cat.

EDIT: The bobcats are easily almost 3 times as big a cat.Come snuggle with momma!

A part of me always thinks about the possibility that the father is suffering from a mental disorder and the son is suffering through his father's eccentricities.I can't decide if this would be a good way for single dads to meet women. Would this be considered endearing or childish?I may have a story that tops this one.

When I was about 6 years old, I broke out in a terrible case of the Chicken Pocks. They were everywhere--my face, chest, back, legs...everywhere. It was a fine summer day and my family wanted to go out on a hike to a waterfall nearby. I was a particularly self-conscious little boy and did not feel comfortable being stared at by neighbours, hikers, etc. I was covered in little white splotches of topical medicine all over my face. So, when it came time to go, I hid in my room and cried. I never did tell my Dad why I did not want to come along. About 10 minutes later he knocked on my bedroom door and came in. He had covered his entire face with my white topical medicine so that I would feel comfortable going outside. I have a great dad.>dad

fingers crossed.I have a feeling that if he was fat and bearded people would make fun of him and question his parenting skills rather than call him a good dad.

Appearance is everything.Every dad should be, in his son or daughters eyes, the coolest person in the world. I'm freaking pumped to have kids. I wanna make them wooden swords like my father did... but minus being a cheating bastard to my mother. Parenting is not building your child a batcave.

My face was scanned using a nextengine scanner (http://www.nextengine.com/) 
and printed on a z-corp Spectrum Z 510 3D printer (http://www.zcorp.com/en/home.aspx)

It costs around $30 per cubic inch of material, and there is about 1 1/3 in^3 material in this print. 

Z-corp makes a whole line of 3D printers that print in color, and they print in a gypsum based powder. This is very frail, so we use infiltrant (I'm currently testing a new one) to penetrate the prints and make them much sturdier. (Though they're still not the kind of thing you drop and expect to survive.)

When, yup, big kitty jumps out about 15 ft past my kid, stops in the middle of the path, looks at him and me, and then jumps to the other side.

STEVE FRENCH!John Marston!Luckily you came across him in the middle of his Friday pyramid-set pushup workout. Gotta stay in shape.Holy fuck! My heart would be pounding out of my chest if I were in your shoes.Amazing how the camouflage blends right in with their environmentA few points: 

1.) As far as I can tell, that's an immature lion.  That could be a good or bad thing since on the one hand, he may not have learned yet that he should be very afraid of humans, while on the other, he could just be young and curious and not really looking at you as prey.  I'm guessing that he's old enough so that mama isn't around (which would be very bad news indeed), but I'm not an expert.  

2.) Once you looked at him and made eye contact, your were basically out of the woods (though not entirely) since pumas are fundamentally ambush predators and really don't like it when their prey knows they are coming.  

3.) Regardless, you do not want to tangle with these boys.  This is one very tough customer and if he did, for whatever reason, decide to get aggressive with you, you would have been lucky to escape with your life and almost certainly would be very badly fucked up.

4.) As is the case with virtually all mammalian predators, pumas really don't want to fight at all, since even though they might kill you, if they get injured such that it affects their ability to hunt, they will starve to death.  This is to say that what they want are much smaller creatures that they can completely ambush.  The upshot here is that if you make a loud and threatening nuisance of yourself, no mountain lion in its right mind (unless it feels cornered or is protecting a kill or its young) will fuck with you at all.  

Anyhow, I could say more but won't.  I've had a few encounters with these guys over the years and have generally found that for the most part, they really don't want to have anything at all to do with humans.You should have been riding your buffalo.Back in 2001 my mom was living on a ""farm"" in Oregon. I say farm because really the only thing they had were chickens. About 15 of them. Great for fresh eggs, not great for much else. Anyways, I was visiting my mom for awhile and it was my responsibility to chop wood, carry water, and start fires to keep the house warm. After being there for a couple of weeks I started to grow accustomed to slight variations in the way the chickens would cluck depending on what was going on. They made one cluck when they were about to get fed, another when they were just milling about, and yet another when my dog (Thunder, a MASSIVE doberman) was chasing them.

Well one day I'm out chopping wood and just minding my own when I hear the chickens making the ""oh shit there's a dog chasing us"" cluck. I sigh to myself thinking I'm going to have to yell at Thunder for the 1000th time. WRONG! I look up and at first I see the chickens running around their coop looking like a bunch of chickens with their collective heads cut off. I quickly scan the scene looking for Thunder but can't see him anywhere. All of a sudden I see a slight movement in the corner of my eye right at the edge of a line of bushes about 20 yards from the coop. As I'm looking at one bush I see a cougar's head slowly pop out as s/he slowly creeps towards the coop. 

I'm standing there, axe in hand, completely dumbfounded. In front of me is not only one of my favorite animals of all time, but also a creature that I am fully aware could kill me in less time than it would take for me to register it had even moved. I mean these beasts can leap 40 feet *horizontally*, they can break the neck of a full grown stag with one punch. I mean, they're fucking tough.

So I'm just looking at this thing and my mind is racing, I have no idea what to do. I'm just a dumb city boy out visiting my mommy and I'm staring at death incarnate as it creeps out of the forest. 

Good thing all it wanted was a chicken. 

That's what I was thinking when, like a gunshot, my idiot dog comes barreling out of the house and charges at the deadly cat and chases it off into the mountains behind the cabin. In my mind the cougar was just leading Thunder deeper into the forest so it could kill him and eat him. What I found out later is that cougars are mostly solitary and as such can't afford to risk injury from fighting/killing anything that could put up a fight. So it just wanted to get the fuck away from my massive dog.

I just stood there for a good 30 minutes staring at where my dog disappeared into the trees. He eventually came back, and I have never seen that dog looking happier. His face said, ""I guarded the house good, didn't I? I sure scared that big cat away, I sure did! Aren't ya proud of me? Can I eat one o' dem chickens now? Huh? HUH?!""

Damn dog. Scared me half to death.I was mountain biking last weekend in Southern California in an area where a mountain lion attacked and killed a bicyclist a few years ago. On my way down, I see a mountain lion, perched, in the middle of the trail. I stop, got off my bike, noticed it was standing its ground. I try to intimidate it by putting my bike over my head and ran towards it screaming and yelling. It called my bluff and watched me expose my homosapien roots. I began to evacuate my bowels. I can now see its plastic eyes stare in to mine... WAIT, PLASTIC?!!!!?! It was a stuffed mountain lion... I am still looking for the youtube video posted by the asshole who pulled this stunt on me.You put your life on the line so you could post this on Reddit. Some may say you're a fool, but I for one respect you. You are a true Redditor.I didn't know mountain lions liked to hike It will kill your horse, and then you.You are seriously a VERY lucky person. These guys are estimated to cover a territory of up to 1000km/squared. I have met people who have lived in the mountains their whole lives (Peru) and have only heard tales of Pumas (Cougars, Mountain Lions etc.). People do not get to see these things in the wild very often. Congrats. and you're still alive? i once read a pamphlet when i was in Banff about what to do if a cougar approaches you. The only advice was ""stand and fight to the death"". And it wasn't a joke.Did anyone else think of the Red Dead Redemption edition of Normal Difficulty?

Instant rage.[deleted]This can't be right - fat and muscle have almost the same density (0.9 vs. 1.06) - see [here](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/576481.html) for a post with more details and referencesSomewhat related... This effect is easy to notice to some extent just by being a overweight and then starting a workout regime, especially if it's lifting etc in addition to just cardio. I've only lost around 5kg total weight during 2 years of steady working out 2-3 times per week, but my body looks pretty different from what it was. So I was wondering wtf is up with the total weight.
When I asked a trainer why I kept on feeling better and better and my performance keeps going up, but the scales weren't showing much progress, we did a body composition scan which we had done to begin with, and it turns out that out of what weight remained, almost 10kg more was muscle instead of fat compared to when I had started.
Kinda wish my gut would disappear faster, but hey, at least I'll be all hercules and shit when I get to that point... heh.Im suddenly in the mood for orange jelloMmmm....steakThat's why I never really care about how heavy I am, rather I just care what I look like. If I gain 5lbs. of muscle or lose 5 lbs. of fat, that's great.All the dudes at my gym are so dense. 
Edit: damn autocorrect But will it blend?Fat is clearly the better value.So when someone says, ""I lost 50 pounds!"" I can imagine 10 of those globs of fat in that picture, and that is how much they had around their body?Is fat really that colour? Or does it depend on what foods said person has been eating? (I don't mean if you only eat Skittles you'll have rainbow fat, but does it have an influence?)I wasn't feeling very motivated to workout when I get home tonight.  This has changed that.I still think I'm just big boned.

The extreme temperatures and acidic atmosphere rapidly destroy any objects we send there. Venera 13 lasted a bit over 2 hours, wildly exceeding expectations.

There's a really informative section of Carl Sagan's Cosmos that talks about the challenges that were involved in designing and sending these probes.Did it bug anyone else when the President's Science Adviser said that we were the only country to land on another planet after the Curiosity landing? This was the first thing that came to my mind.Timeout: we've been to fucking Venus?Even their space probes have dash-cams!I would just like to remind everyone why picture of the surface of Venus are, for the most part, more spectacular than those of Mars(this doesn't discount the awesomeness that is the Curiosity rover, just the picture taking). There is a difference in temperature of somewhere in the nature of 560C. Let me tell you, it is slightly easier to send a probe into the cold of space and then the cold of Mars. But you get some serious changes with the expansion of materials when you go from the cold of space to 480C, 920F.

EDIT: Imagine trying to take a picture with your digital camera you built at 1atm, 14.7psi of atmospheric pressure, at 25C and then sending it into the vacuum of space(~3 atoms per meter^3) and -270C , and the dropping it onto the surface of Venus, ~480C and ~90atm, 1300psi. I love the spikes--in case of interplanetary battlebots, I can only presume.I had no idea that we'd had anything land on Venus. Awesome.  

Edit: Whoa, nearly one-sixth of my karma is from this comment.Another angle or just cleaned up version [here](http://www.strykfoto.org/v132colex23bf.jpg)Perhaps this is irrelevant, but a week after Venera 13 landed our solar system was in a [syzygy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_\(astronomy\)), where all the planets (9 at the time) were on one side of the sun simultaneously.

EDIT: Even more irrelevant fact--There are not enough ""Y"" tiles in a Scrabble set for you to use this word. Otherwise ""Syzygys"" would earn you 77 points even without any special tiles. Don Mitchell reprocessed the images for clearer quality. His site, filled with information from the Soviet Venera missions, can be found [here.](http://www.mentallandscape.com/V_Venus.htm)

Edit: Obligatory ""Holy crap, front page of Reddit!"" edit. Go science!If we can come together for the Olympics, why can't we get together and launch a man mission to mars?The Yellow Planet... So forgotten... so cool. Does anyone have some information on the kind of imaging and image processing technology which has been used for this mission?
Nowadays I think this is a relatively simple task, the technology for digital imaging sensors and digital image compression is rather widespread and the result is a digital image which can be transferred easily as packets to the relay station...
But how was this done in 1982? Did CCD sensors exist back then? I don't think so....  If it was an analog image, how was it processed and transferred to Earth?
 Anyone got some information to enlighten me?I think its time for another cold war[deleted]Take a moment and think about this...

You're living in a time where we have pictures from the surface of other planets. 

Just think about that.It's amazing what the human race is capable of with a little determination. 

Thanks, OP! Cool shit.I wonder what kind of condition Venera 13 is in now.In retrospect, the cold war was full on at that point and the Russians very well could've engineered an entire work force of flying unicorns and the American public would have likely just been kept in the dark about it. Because, well, dem Reds.When looking at this photo, did anyone else wonder what Venus smells like?I am an old guy.  Ever since I was very young I have been fascinated with planets and junk.  Seeing them in encyclopediae made them look like candy floating out in space.

I am so fucking excited to see HD video from Mars. *(hurry up)*Pfft, Venus. It doesn't look so hot.I'm confused.   Do people think Curiosity was the first thing we've landed on Mars?  A lot of comments seem to be hinting that this is the first.   It's not.   The first probe we sent to Mars, and got pictures back, happened in the 1970's.  Great post.

(there's a lot more!)> In photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality. 

[Alfred Stieglitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Stieglitz)

There is an excellent exhibit in DC at the Newseum on photos that won the Pulitzer.  It's so moving. Some make your heart soar ..some break your heart.  There is a short film on the photographers, it was very interesting hearing their perspective. I teared up during it.  I heard, or read about the Tiananmen ""Tank Man"" photo. The guy stashed the film in his hotel's toilet tank, and the secret police kicked his door in and ransacked it looking for film. He fled and later snuck back in and got the film.

Almost as crazy as the photo itself.I like how to most recent ""modern"" photo's photographer is a hipster. Side-ways fedora... what is he, paul wall going formal. lolSteve McCurry (photographer of ""Afghan Girl"") is an egotistical asshole who cares more about his reputation than photojournalism. The look in his subject's eyes is disdain for the photographer.Guy with the world trade centers picture looked like he hated that it happened but at the same time was really proud of his picture. But the guy with the Tienanmen square picture just looked like he did not want to be remembering it. I like the little background behind the Einstein photograph.This blog tells the story behind the photos http://behindthephotos.tumblr.comFor anyone who's able, I highly recommend visiting the Newseum in Washington, DC. On the first floor is an exhibit of every Pulitzer Prize winning photograph. For many of them, you hear the photographer's story of taking the photo.It's interesting that you can see how the sad photographs have photographers who aren't smiling.[Such an inspiration.](http://i.imgur.com/gXcMq.jpg)That guy who took the Einstein photo...

Scruffy?where are the women?Hm. The photographs of poverty/war/death were all taken by very gloomy-looking photographers, whereas the photos of Einstein, Ali etc were all taken by excited/proud photographers.

can anybody answer me if this is what is called a tensegrity principle of architecture (or simply of structures)?When you get your head around it, it's no more special than how the string in a bow-and-arrow bow is ""held upright by stress"", if you were to glue the bow uprightConstant stress is what keeps me up too.Reminds me of being at work.Aren't we all...hey i work at alstom! and im doing this rather than work as we speak!It's really more tension than stress.

Have been aching to go back ever since I stepped off the plane back in Denmark. Fantastic city.NYer here. I see a lot of comments about how large the park looks. It really is quite massive. It's really nice to be able to actually feel outdoors when you're surrounded by buildings at all times. There's a nature trail in the park where you can *almost* not see any buildings. It's a great place and NYC would not be nearly as good without it.I feel there is a lot less COOL pictures like this on reddit these days.

A penthouse apartment overlooking one of those lakes? Must be at least tens of millions of dollars.[deleted]How rich do you have to be to get a boat out into that lake?I think that looks awesome! :D Now do you know what else of aerial photography is awesome? This youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76F7XE1_BGU when you watch it, prepare to have your mind blown. The song in the video is by Clams Casino and it's called ""I'm God""Selling the park for real estate development would decimate more than just the real-estate values of surrounding properties.   As a native NY'er I can tell you that people come from everywhere to Central Park - especially in the summer.    We train or bus it to the park.   We skate to it.  We bike there.   Or just plain old walk.    It may be small compared to other parks in the US, but as an experience of NY, it's vast. Fabulous people watching @ strawberry fields.    You can hang out listening to musicians who show up to play just about everything under the sun:  chamber music, Classic Rock, tunes from musicals, improv.     

You can even visit the Central Park zoo or jog around the reservoir.    And when it's all said and done, you can go to Nirvana for Indian food and sit at a table overlooking the park @ night and sip lasse's with your honey.

The park has value far beyond its real estate potential.

I just wanna know what he planned on doing with it if he actually got outside with it.  edit: It reminds me of Burn After Reading -

your proposed threat,*

  
*you would experience such 
a shit storm of consequences, my friend,*

  
*that your empty little head
would be spinning!!**The demons...they are everywhere. Yes. All around us. At every moment. But I know it. I know. I know how to control them. I know what's bringing them here. I must make them leave. I must protect my friend whatever the cost. It's time...*

He slinks around the corner without making a sound. His eyes peer around the room, taking in everything. The chatter-light-box is working, the light squares are covered somewhat by draping fabrics, and the sitting thrones are empty. He shifts his gaze down to the floor and spots it. *Yes, the Staff.*

He didn't know how it did what it did, but no matter what he tried to do to get rid of it, it would always find it's way back into the house. This source of evil would teleport sporadically and shape-shift into whatever it needed to be to escape his grasp.

This time would be different, though. He had a plan. He'd been hatching this idea for a while now. It required precision and measurements unlike anything he had attempted before. He had spent hours sitting on the bottom portion of the light squares, looking at the movement on the other side. He had often heard of the magic of that world, but he still didn't know if it would work. All he knew was that if he could remove the Staff from this location, it would remove the demons.

He began moving towards the Staff. As he approached it, he felt oddly uneasy. *It must be changing my emotions. I need to be strong.* He tilted his head down and slowly took hold of the Staff. It had a strange texture to it. One end was solid and the other softly caressed his right side. It was an odd sensation. He wanted to rub himself on it...he needed to rub himself on it. *Keep it together, damn it!*

He made himself blink out of his stupor and started walking towards the outer portal. He could see it dead ahead. He began feeling more and more confident. He was actually going to make it. Finally, after years of this infernal Staff, he and his friend would be freed of it's magic. He would finally b-

*What? I...I can't...*

He tried moving forward, but movement was impossible. His face was resting against the portal and he could see the light on the other side. His confidence slowly gave way to fear. *This isn't possible! I'm right here! Why can't I do it? WHY?!*

He tried pushing, turning, and moving back and forth, but it was all to no avail. Suddenly, he heard a sound behind him. He dropped the Staff and looked back.

His friend was standing some distance behind him, looming. He was holding an artifact in his hand and speaking. He was ashamed of not having been able to exit with the Staff, but he didn't know how to tell his friend.

*I...I'm so sorry. I tried, human-pet. But mark my words: I will not give up until we have rid ourselves of this monstrosity. Even if it's the end of me.*[deleted]""MUST..KEEP..PUSHING""[deleted]where do the people of reddit get such funny cats?  mine was always just an angry squawking bitch.""Mmmph!MMMmmmmphh!Mmmmmmmph!MMMMMMMMPHHH!""[deleted]The tail is so fluffy and nice :D","{'Sadness': 0.043767, 'Anger': 0.969213, 'Analytical': 0.61, 'Emotional_Range': 0.884, 'Tentative': 0.44, 'Joy': 0.043823, 'Disgust': 0.383213, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.049, 'Fear': 0.752858, 'Openness': 0.064, 'Extraversion': 0.848, 'Agreeableness': 0.875}"

 This let cool and thicken to be and occasionally stirring (takes a while). 

 In the meantime you what you already baked biscuit into 2 layers have cut and fill your pie with your filling of choice. 
 Keep your cake as yet just a breadboard or other surface you can easily rotate because the sides dalijk skimming is a nice mess  
 Break the kitkats already in 2 and and put them ready. 
 Look how it is with the chocolate mixture, when he was about as thick as custard eg you can rub the sides to go with it. 
 Use a spatula or just the back side of a knife. 

 If you have the whole cake smeared around the kitkats go against it stick. 
 This is a difficult job, the kitkats are still not enough paste so fall occasionally. 
 Put them a little slanted so they lean against your cake. 
 If they were all sitting around doing you a quick ribbon around it and put them all pretty straight. 

 If the rest of the chocolate mixture just pour this liquid on top of the cake. 
 Please note, read it too thin it goes through the kitkats walk around! 

 Then you put the pigs in the still soft chocolate and put in the fridge. 
 Serving tips 
 After an hour you can put cake on a beautiful plate and serve, enjoy!

Just because ""HEY GUYS LOOK THESE MUSLIMS AREN'T TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE!""... how is that something for us to be impressed by?

EDIT: ""but postsinsensitively, it's freedom of speech lol!"" yes. It is. Which is why I couldn't condemn the protest.

Your calls for blasphemy laws go against what the western world in general believes is integral and sacred to every single person.

agree or not, people have a civil and HUMAN right to speak their mind freely on ANY subject, in any manner they choose.

Your feelings can be hurt, and your prophet can be shamed.    I do not believe in their fucking god, how dare they try and make their god take precedence over my rights.

If you dont agree, fuck you, go live in a country that closer suits your ideas and leave mine alone.It may be a peaceful protest, but I don't see any women out there.  Are they not allowed?Still, making a protest with around 500 people, because someone made a silly cartoon, is pretty over the edge imo... Why would it be in the news? A peaceful and civilised protest is expected by default, it shouldn't be in the news!I like how they're all in traditional middle eastern wear, then the one badass is wearing a pink polo, nice slacks and some classy shoes.On the contrary!

How dim and stale are the hallways in those buildings compared to today? There are no computers in those offices and no televisions in (most of) those apartments. There are cigarettes and cigarette smoke everywhere. I don't know, I'm not trying to be dramatic, I just think it's really neat, and have my upvote.The 40s really were a different time.I always find it weird looking at pictures like this or thinking of times past because it always has this layer of wonder or mystery of what it must have been like to live in that time. Then you think to the people that actually did live in that time period that their lives were just the same as ours, completely mundane. It was just normal for them. Just like how normal our lives feel right now. Their lives just took place in a different period where it looks almost surreal to us but to them it's just another day.

But this is what Hollywood has taught us to think of as a tsunami – a monstrous multi story-high megawave, which washes over shores and swallows whole cities.

A tsunami is more like a bulldozer. That is, thousands of rather speedy bulldozers. About that hight, exactly the same stoic forward momentum. A wall in the way? Bulldozer don't care. A car in the way? Bulldozer laugh. A House in the way? Let me call my bulldozer friends.

That being said, tsunamis are terrifying. Not because they look like what we know from the movies, but because they creepily build up the water masses, bringing tons of pushing power. Slow enough to keep a safe distance from, but completely impossible to stop.

Here's a insightful video from the [2011 tsunami in Japan](http://youtu.be/2uJN3Z1ryck).where and when was this taken? Thanks.
This is what an offshore fog bank looks like rolling in: I'm pretty sure it's fog. I've seen this phenomenon quite a few times off the coast of Cape Cod.

People who actually knew what that was laughed and started giving the cloud the looks at the same time.i would love to see this in a videoBased on other comments I think it is [advective fog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog#Types). Warmer moist air is moving over the cooler lake water and condensing. As the cloud molecules shift up or down while warming/cooling, they create the wave formation that moves.

Are the plants renewing themselves?

Sorry for bad english...This is why I love biology. At one point, almost all of those atoms (those *exact* atoms) that are in the plant were at one point in the soil. Furthermore, some of those water molecules were part of carbohydrates at one point. It is completely possible that the plant is using an oxygen atom that was once part of its cellulose as a hydrogen donor for photosynthesis (in the form of a water molecule). 

Tl;dr - SCIENCE Keep it away from Pauly Shore.So how is this done? if i would like to make my own? can i do it in a smaller glass bottle. Read the article a few days back -- he actually planted it Easter 1960, and has only opened it once to water in 1972, so technically watered once in (almost) 53 years.

Photosynthesis creates moisture which runs back into the soil, and rotting leaves create the CO^2 needed. It's a pretty cool example of a self-sustaining ecosystem.

Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.htmlThis reminds me of [SCP-119](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-119) and that test where they accidentally create an ecosystem:

>CONTENTS: 1L of water in a shallow glass bowl. Temperature in room containing SCP-119 lowered to 1°C.
TIME INPUT: 600
POWER LEVEL: 5
TEST RESULTS: Time inside SCP-119 intended to be approximately 24.7 years, with an initial input of 60 seconds. Test intended to determine the difference of atmosphere and heat transfer between the inside and outside of SCP-119, as demonstrated by the evaporation of water at near-freezing temperatures. The research assistant entering the time added an extra zero, which would bring the total time up to 2,465,753 years, or over four thousand years a second. Upon pressing START, an immense amount of air began to cycle through the vent. The assistant immediately recognized his mistake and opened the door to stop the timer, at which point a wave of bluish spores emitted from SCP-119 and onto the assistant. The assistant began to choke and quickly asphyxiated. Subsequent testing on atmospheric conditions revealed low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels, as well as elevated levels of sulfur. The spores were found to be an unknown Xerophillic species of mold. Within SCP-119 was a dense ecosystem of molds and Tardigrades (water bears), along with numerous other unknown species, some of which do not neatly fit within existing categories. The entire ecosystem has created a balanced atmosphere, and seems to have stemmed from the original contents of the water, air, and the assistant.I always wondered how big a fish tank would have to be to be self-sustaining.It was just 1 really long, 40 year, continuous wateringwe made a very small version of this in kindergarten..im still fascinated by it. favorite thing i remember from that class..besides lemon cookies..i like lemon cookies.Holy crap it's grown a human!Let's start raising children in these things.

But no, it was just bright dots. The OP described which one was which, but didn't explain how he actually got that information from the picture itself.

im from Houston. there are no mountains down here, its all flat.

we landed about 5:30 am, just in time for the sun to barley be up. I saw that mountain in the distance from the airport and it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. Hey Look! The Mountain is out!To all the people saying you can see your house, PLEASE. This is facing south, Everett isn't even in the frame!Even though I've been to just a handful of places, I think western Washington (and Seattle, to be specific) can, at certain times of the year, be one of the most beautiful places in existence.

Such a beautiful city.Several years ago I visited the [Museum of Flight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Museum_of_Flight) at Boeing Field in Seattle. I noticed a sign for Biplane rides and knew I couldn't pass that up.  [It looks like they're still in business](http://www.oldethymeaviation.com/).

It was a bit intimidating to be on the taxiway in an open air cockpit plane built in 1942 waiting to take off between a 767 and a C-17.Wow, what a beautiful shot.  I flew to Seattle about a month ago, and as a first-time visitor to the Pacific Northwest, it blew my freaking mind.  So beautiful up there.Took a vacation here in 2007 and 2008. Moved in 2009.

EDIT: I am not saying that only rich people ride horses.... Its just that they CAN and MOST OFTEN cost a lot of  money. Anyone can be an equestrian without being extremely rich, if they are willing to make sacrifices!

Edit: I never knew that calling horses expensive would cause such a ruckus with some people..... Grow up.....I've never seen something make the front page with such a sad collection of upvotes on the commentsThat's crazy! Horses can't talk! I'm Bryan Fellows.Guys, guys... did we all forget about Red Dead Redemption?British gold medal winners...! Boom! I'm curious, what's the bigger factor in equestrian - the skill and focus of the rider, or the physical and mental prowess of the horse?As a fellow male equestrian, I can confirm this is true.
Flexible guys*What kind of guys get into equestrian*? The cool ones.I have some experience with show jumping through my wife. Her current horse actually qualified for the Olympics In 2004 but hasn't done much jumping since. 

A lot of them are rich dandies, but a good many put a lot of work into this. They usually all have grooms to handle the mundanity horse tasks but the better ones do as much work themselves as possible. They put a lot of work into riding and training, and it is not an easy sport. Some are gay, some have hot wives, and most live this lifestyle day in and out. Personally, I am glad to be rid of it, way too much money and work. (as the husband who doesn't ride professionally, I became the groom)

However, if you do get into riding and showing you will have no shortage of fine looking honeys at your disposal. They might assume you are gay, but get past that and you are made. I've found the dressage this past week absolutely amazing. How can they make the horses do the moves?My wife's dressage instructor says gay ones.My girlfriend is an equestrian, I never really cared for it and honestly wrote it off before i dated her. But since, I started respecting the sport, horses and riders. It's actually amazing when you think about the training and perfection of two different animals interacting so closely together. There is a bond there I will never understand, and I respect that. 

I still always ask my girl what kind of guys get into it because I personally would never be interested, and she doesn't really know. I always just thought it may have been that the boys were playing with Barbies and Pony's instead of cars and action figures, but in respect of the sport and the riders, any affinity with an animal on that level deserves tremendous respect. To each his own!

The sport is extremely expensive though, and requires a lot of time, money and dedication.I used to be friends with his brother.  He actually cleans stables for a living!  Man, I miss my friend, Poor Fellers.Plenty of nowhere-near-rich people ride/own horses. Including myself. I really have no idea why people think that about all riders/horse owners.  It's a sport and a passion just like anything else and you can put whatever you want into it. To trot or not to trot, that is equestianThis guy is a fellow  trainer in my town, and by fellow trainer I mean he has more talent in his pinky than I do ino my entire body.He is super nice and modest. The surrounding farms are garishly elaborate and his is simple and functional. The local horse community is super proud of him,  this opportunity couldn't have happened to a better person. GO RICH AND FLEXIBLE!!!I'm an equestrian. I'm a poor college student. I work my ass off doing extra work around the barns and working two jobs just to get a chance to ride a horse every day. I won't be able to afford a horse until I'm much older with a real job. I am dedicated to the sport and I humbly kick some serious ass.

I also get a lot of ass of the female homosapien variety. The horse world is littered with skinny attractive girls just looking for a man who shares the same affinity for horses.

Go to hell all of you who are too ignorant or sheltered to view horsemanship as a lifestyle worthy of respect.

Bob Loblaw out.

EDIT: GrammarI'll tell you what kind of guys: guys who fell in love with a horsey girl and wanted something to talk about with them. That's how it starts. After you spend a little time at it, taking lessons, etc, you realize how absofuckingly difficult it is to do well. Then, as you continue to take lessons and maybe start showing a little, you have a moment when your horse does something that expresses their fantastic heart and courage and then you're a goner.Rich is a top class father and person. As an equestrian, we have a tough gig. We work with a partner, one that takes time and incredible patience. It's a marriage. We are the only sport in the games involving not an object, but a thinking being. Sometime we get nutcrackers. It's expensive but if you work hard and apply yourself anything is attainable. At first I thought this was My Little Pony related. I was disappoint.I used to show jump at a much lower level and I rarely saw male riders. We're talking maybe one or two per fifty girls at shows. There seems to be many more of them at higher levels. Where do they come from?!This is called an [""aptronym""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptronym) .

I only ask because I assume in that very dim light you would have to keep the shutter open a while, and when you see those time-lapse pics of waterfalls they have the same slightly-off quality to the falling water.

Of course, whoever took the pic might not have realised, the camera could be doing it automatically.

I've seen it posted a few times, but I have my doubts about how good they actually come out. Great idea, still I think regardless of how tight you tie string or a rubberband around the bottom of the straws there would still be leakage. I would suspect put rubberbands around the 100 straws on both ends, add to milk carton, then add maybe a half-inch to inch of water and put in freezer. You may need to add some weight ontop of the straws to keep it submerged in the water. After frozen you can add the (alcoholic) jello into the straws and not only will it not leak out but the bottom ice will help it congeal faster in fridge. Adding just a little water shouldn't make it to difficult to remove after its set either. Directions were not clear enough, got my penis stuck in the straw.

It took me until I was in my 20s to get over the crushing impact of douchbag teachers. Now I bet they'll say their cruelty was why I was so successful (no Nobel prize, thought). 

Feynman mentions that, after he helped his daughter with some maths problems, the teacher sent home a note saying his methods, etc., was wrong. He replied, and, at the end of his note, mention his Nobel Prize and Einstein Mathematics Medal. Hey! Teacher! Leave that kid alone!I don't like these ""see, Einstein wasn't good in school!"" types of things because all it does is reinforce the 99.9999% of everyone else that it's OK to suck too because, ""look at that guy."" These people are extreme exceptions to the rule. Odds are, you aren't the next Einstein so stay in school, kids.Hm, I'd really like to see if there's a study on accuracy on teachers ""predictions"" regarding the future of their students (although there is of course the self-fulfilling prophecy element).I see math in shapes. When I do math in my head, I'm simply manipulating the shapes to reach the conclusion. My High School Algebra teacher thought I had cheated when I had completed an extra credit calculus problem she gave us. I started drawing the equation on the blackboard  to show her how I solved it. She saw my pictures, grabbed the erasure and wiped away my work. I got sent to the principal for being 'unteachable'.

I kind of wanted to go back to my old HS with my BS's in EE and Mathematics, but I felt like I would be stooping to her level.His science teacher is dead.I read the title as John Gruden because I am slow, and my first thought was: HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!Don't be too quick to judge. It's not inconceivable that the teacher was right about his attitude at the time, and that the consequences of this note may have lead to him becoming the scientist he is today. Perhaps his parents forced him to shape up. Maybe he was ashamed about it, and upped his own game.

This note may just have been the catalyst he needed to excel.I'm calling this bogus until I see a source. Similar apocryphal stories seem to surface around most famous scientists. Generally they turn out to be fake.My 6th grade teacher was responsible for deciding if students would go into the advanced math track or have two more years of basic math.  She put me in the basic track because I never paid much attention and skipped steps to get my answers.  Luckily my 7th grade teacher was much better and realized that my being asleep in class, skipping steps and still getting all right answers meant I was in the wrong class.  He went to the principle and argued that I should be moved and so I was the following year.  My 8th grade teacher then told me I would never make it because they had a 50% drop out rate and I was already a year behind the others.  I finished 8th grade with the 2nd highest grade in the class and I mailed a copy of my report card to both my 6th and 7th grade teachers.To be fair, he went to Eton - one of the best and oldest high schools schools in the world. He probably did not shine as brightly as his classmates and so his teacher thought him to be less than.[Eat it, Mills](http://i.imgur.com/8S2xq.png)As usual responses here are highly skewed. A lot of redditors seem to be naturally very good at math. The standard opinion seems to be that since the teacher did not like them skipping showing their work, the teacher is stupid and narrow-minded. I think in general, posters are being unfair to teachers. Sure the extreme examples show heartless teachers. But just because you happen to be the 1 out of 100 students who can leap ahead does not mean that teachers should pander to your style of learning at the expense of the other 99 students. For most students, following standard patterns for problem solving is necessary and you expecting your teacher to magically understand your ""genius"" method of solving problems is awfully self-centered. Of course there are plenty of horrible teachers, but there also plenty of pricks in class who like to derail what a teacher is trying to show the class.I love the circlejerk that is about to happen in this comment thread.TIL nfl coaches *can* win Nobel PrizesThe inset was photoshopped to look authentic.

Sad, really.If my daughter brings that report card home then we're going out for ice cream.I'm hardly a nobel prize winner, but I'm a pretty successful engineer, and my high school algebra II teacher once suggested to my parents that I wasn't cut out for rigorous mathematics in college, and that if I was interested in electronics, to check out a trade program. Well, I'm not a project leader and head electrical engineer at a start up, and doing pretty well. While my teacher was clearly wrong about me, I know that he wasn't being malicious. In many ways he was right - in high school I didn't take my work too seriously. I barely got through Algebra II and calculus in high school. It wasn't until college that I started to improve my ways. When I see this note, I don't think it's a note from a scumbag teacher, but a look in to the high school life of a nobel laureate, and a lesson in that it's never too late to change and take charge of your life.Wow.  That's a life lesson summed up in one paragraph.My high school teachers thought that I would never account for anything in this world, even though their poor teachings discouraged me to do well. I'm top of my class in college now! High school can kiss my ass! This reminds of my own experince in HS, I was mocked by my Chemistry teacher for always trying to solve exercises my own way instead of following the standard recipe, now in have a Ph.D of Physics.Isn't that the essence of being a good scientist, mathematician or inventor?

It took me a while to figure out why someone would make/buy these things when suddenly it hit me. These shirts were specifically designed for fat kids to wear when swimming. They are polyester so they will dry easily and not get heavy like cotton when wet, and they have bold colorful designs so you cannot see through them when wet.[deleted]Guy on left.

We're not sure if anything actually happened to them because none of them ever spoke a word again.

Emerging in the morning, each of those people was missing his or her tongue.

It did not appear to have been torn out or cut off -- just a smooth surface at the back of their mouths, as if they had been born without tongues in the first place.

No amount of cajoling, questions or reasoning could get any of them to write down or otherwise relate anything that happened to them.

If you asked them about their night in the house, they would just stare at you, unblinking, and tremble until you went away again.

Other than that, and their apparent inability to sleep more than a few minutes at a time without waking up screaming, every one of these people has gone on to live perfectly normal lives.

As someone who was there to see the entire thing happen (I will message mods with proof), the protest was not completely non-violent. Glass bottles and rocks were being thrown at the police. Not saying this justifies anything but I just want to clarify that aspect of it.In the CNN article it says:

""Police said they fired the tear gas on protesters in Oakland, California, after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers.""

 - but at the same time, we hear that the protest was non-violent. I've not investigated what the story actually is, but there's the news. 

Survived 2 tours in Iraq only to get done in by one's countrymen.  The irony. So whats up with the 'NO MAJOR NEWS COVERAGE?' It isn't breaking news, it will probably be all over the local and major news networks by tonight. It is on the front page of the [huffingtonpost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/oakland-police-critically_n_1033430.html), [abc news blog](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/occupy-oakland-protester-severely-injured-in-police-clash-ided-as-iraq-war-veteran/), and a [host of other sites](http://news.google.com/news/more?hl=en&gl=us&q=Injured+Occupy+Oakland&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw=1132&bih=601&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ncl=dKYM7Q5zn04ddoMPyPVMksB8clQ2M&ei=AnCoTt2bOoO3twfxxZ0M&sa=X&oi=news_result&ct=more-results&resnum=1&ved=0CC8QqgIwAA).

Hi reddit. After leaving for work, I dreaded what I would return to. Dont worry though, you did NOT disappoint. Repeat comment, comments attacking me for not responding, comments for a ""sensationalist title"". However, I acknowledge you had no idea I was out earning money to pay for my education. 

Now, I would like to clear some things up.

AT THE TIME I posted this, there was no major news coverage. I know the television news will take time, but it angered me there was no internet news coverage by anything but small blogs and whatnot.

As far as the ""sensationalist title"" - I was angry. I have family that has served in the military. Seeing this happen to a 2-tour vet greatly upset me. SO IM SORRY FOR USING CAPS.

Once again, AT THE TIME THIS WAS POSTED, the little blogs and articles(once again, no major news coverage) that were out on this said nothing about rocks, bottle, or eggs. SO, theres an obvious assumption with no news of attacking police, and police ""attacking first"". Im pissed at Occupy Oakland for breaking the peaceful protest demonstration, because now, theres slim chance they can return to such a state. Im sorry for my ""ignorance"" of not editing and correcting myself, but once again no work= no school.

NOW that we've got this squared away, Iraq Veterans Against the War have contacted me. They gave me links to share with reddit, http://ivaw.org/ is their site. They are updating it with Scott Olsen's status as they receive the news. A support page for Scott Olsen has also been set up. http://ivaw.org/donate/scott-olsen

#occupyphilly (protester, not ""leader"")As a police officer, I apologize for the terrorists that these douche-bag ""officers of the law"" are. I'm not anywhere near Oakland but I would never let this happen. If it did happen, I would find that fucker and arrest him myself. You know those cell mates love having a former police officer with them in the pin. http://www.veteransforpeace.org/news_detail.php?idx=122[Front Page of the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/iraq-vet-oakland-police-tear-gas_n_1033159.html)http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/26/us/occupy-wall-steet/index.html?hpt=us_c1

There is major news coverage. Want to Occupy [City Name Here]? Get one of these:

http://www.amazon.com/Israeli-Civilian-Mask-Nato-Filter/dp/B0002XJ2OU

Let the cops shower you with tear gas, then calmly put on your gas mask, link arms, and sit the fuck down. The police WILL use tear gas on demonstrators. This is not news. Any time young people have tried to bring change to their government, it has been common practice for nearly 100 years. Chemical warfare is nothing new. For less than $20 you can have up to 8 hours of breathing protection.One night in late August 1972 I had been down at the Convention Center in Miami Beach. Nixon was being nominated as the Republican candidate for President. There were some meek protests going on, very restrained for the most part, the lesson of Kent State still fresh in young minds.

The police started tear gassing the entire region near the Convention center, as far south as Lincoln Road, and old Jews living in South Beach were getting pretty rowdy. Far more rowdy than the kids protesting the war. The tear gas had them swarming out of apartments and yelling at the cops firing and throwing tear gas. The more polite made references to Nazis, Gestapo and the Holocaust. I heard and saw an old lady with a number down her arm upbraid a policeman in terms which made it clear she was certain what he was, and had survived it in the past.

I decided it was time to exercise some discretion and started walking down Alton Road towards the park (Lummis?) where some friends in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War were camping (they had permits to camp and to march in protests).

As I walked south that night the Miami Beach SWAT team left the Convention center and marched in formation past on their way to attack the VVAW encampment.

By the time I got to the park the police had beat, bashed and trashed.

Game over.

The 'freedom' those guys had fought for in Vietnam was just a sham and their 'thanks' from America was a kel-light to the skull, a knee in the balls, and a quick trip to the slam. Possessions trashed and hauled to the dump.

That was 39 years ago, and it could be today.

#occupyphilly (protester, not ""leader"")This is completely unacceptable, my sympathies to his family.Wow. That sums up how I feel about how the US handling Occupy Wall Street and other cities. If this man dies, shit is going to get real.

Congrats Oakland PD, you've just given #ows our first Martyr.

A US war vet.

You guys just fucked yourself in the ass, hardcore.

My money says there's a lot of politicians secretly praying tonight that Mr. Olsen makes a quiet, speedy recovery.Christ. Do they know how this happened if the protest was non-violent?

On the other hand... It is uplifting to see and the people around him coming to his aid. The picture of about 4-5 hands pressing against the cloth being held up against his head wound is particularly telling.

I wish him a speedy recovery! Thank you for bringing this up!Oakland police have specifically denied using flash bangs. California's KGO Newstalk radio station has a transcription from a police press conference held this morning. The police spokesman was asked: ""Did the Police deploy rubber bullets, flash-bang grenades?""

The answer:

    No, the loud noises that were heard originated from M-80 explosivesthrown atPolice by protesters. In addition, Police firedapproximately four bean bagroundsat protesters to stop them from throwing dangerous objects at the officers. This world is ripe for collapse.This guy served for our country, then comes home and gets shot  by our own police. This is really messed up. I'm pretty sure that when he was deployed to go fight for our country this is not what he was fighting for. America... You are slowly imploding.It was not non-violent. It started out non-violent, but then some folks started throwing rocks and shit at the police, and the police did what police do in such circumstances.As a European I can only say that we've won our stability here through hundreds of years of bloody revolution and war.

""Sweet! I've had this extra ethernet cord that's been cluttering up my box for like a week!""If you're tired of tangled cords, learn how to do whats called an over/under wrap (aka flip-coiling). It's what stagehands/roadies have used for years to prevent tangles, and it keeps your cables in better condition (doesnt induce a twist into the cord like a standard wrap does). pure genius. thank you!I wouldn't do this as the bends in the cable are at too acute an angle. They will end up corrugated when you take them out, and it will shorten their lifespan.

I use the no twist sound engineer cable wrapping technique, and a bit of electrical tape to stop the coil unravelling. I can then chuck them all in a box, and they still don't get tangled.hello lifehacker.com.... As brilliant as this is, I would never maintain it. 

I'd remove a cord, then replace by tossing it into the hole where the roll used to be. Eventually it would regress back into a box full of tangled cords. [deleted]I just use a separate zip-lock bag for each cable then I throw them all in a single drawer. Works like a charm.
What a shitty idea!**WARNING WARNING WARNING** 

Please please please don't do this for any data cables. *Especially Ethernet cords*.

Any cable bends in an Ethernet cable (or similar data carrying line) greater than 90 degrees will damage the copper core and cause severe reflections of data, therefore increasing the retransmission rate (lost/faulty packets). 

What makes it worse is that the signal will still get through, and it will technically work. However it will either constantly or periodically reduce your network speeds to a crawl. It's often very difficult to identify faulty cables when troubleshooting network issues (unless they straight up don't work), even for a seasoned network tech. 

So please, for your sake, and for the sake of your local internet help desk, do not pack anything other than power cords this way.  You clever bastard!I just saved the rubber bands from heads of Broccoli and used those to bind each cable individually, then just stuff as many into a box as possible.  Works good for me, though I can see this as a much easier way to FIND them once you've stored them.

Oh, and for boxes to store them in, just go here (Ebay branded boxes are free):  http://ebaysupplies.usps.com/usps

Btw, I love Broccoli :).I use ziplock bags instead, they accomodate larger power blocks, while still  preventing tangling.[deleted]Fuck me in the goat ass .... and I just threw out a bunch of those ... More poop for me....Are you a wizard?what if someone with poop hands touches the roller? Now all your cords are possibly poopified.Wrapping them in rubber bands = less wasted space between tubes.

While on our way to the property we stopped at McDonalds and I had a happy meal, I was 7. The tree came with the meal and we actually asked for a second tree (planted in the front yard, just as big). My mom always snapped a photo of me by the tree each summer to gauge it's growth. It quickly surpassed me and now I'm enjoying the cottage with my lovely wife and two children. I'm thrilled with the response this received from most of you! Thanks Reddit!This is probably too far down to ever be seen, but here's ours.
http://i.imgur.com/0qE3A.jpgMcDo should bring back the trees instead of those plastic toys!Call McDonalds. They'll probably pay a lot for a happy story like that to use in their ads.anyone have a pic of what it looked like 20 years ago? [deleted]Has is sprouted any Big Macs yet?We were given trees every year on arbor day in elementary school.  In the yard of the house I grew up in there is a line of pine trees like this, all over 30 feet tall all, all of which I planted.  

So sad that they don't hand saplings out any more.and 20 years later you are finally able to reap some karma, all is proceeding as plannedMcNificentI planted one of these 19 or 20 years ago and I used to drive by it every year or so to see how big it had gotten until the new owners of the house cut it down last year.You've just inspired me to go out and buy a few trees.  My son and I will plant them when he gets back from his Grandfathers.  Thanks!That mother fucka is GLORIOUS!  Nice tree mate.You are not alone!!!! My little tree from McDonald's Earth Day is still in the front yard of my childhood home. It's so tall that it has needed to be trimmed several times because of its interference with telephone wires. 

I have written to McDonald's multiple time with photos of my tree asking them to do it again. Their response was always something along the lines of ""McDonald's has many other programs that help the environment and has no current plans to distribute trees with Happy Meals."" So sad. The last time I wrote to them I mentioned that environmental responsibility doesn't just come from corporate programs but is more effective if demonstrated to children at a young age so that it becomes part of who they are and how they treat nature.

It makes me so happy that someone else still has their tree!!! No fair, all I got was diarrhea.It wasn't such a bad little tree, all it needed was a little love.Where are you that they gave out trees with Happy Meals? I'm old enough to remember twenty years ago; I never got a tree. :(Logged in just to upvote that.  I think my brother's tree and mine were probably hit with the lawn mower at a very young age... They didn't make it.Wow!  My mom moved out of the house I grew up in this year.  I planted one of those trees and it hardly grew and we always called it my Charlie Brown tree.  The new owners heard the backstory behind the tiny tree and promised never to cut it down.  you should fall from the tree and sue[deleted]Blue Spruce
You supersized it![deleted]I planted one of these in my front yard when I was a child. i made sure to water it on a schedule my mother had laid out for me.

Cool story bro:

Just a few weeks ago I was eating at my favorite Mexican spot on my break. There's an older lady (40-50) on the corner of the bar. She orders a margarita, and when she gets her drink she begins to tell the bar tender how she was there a few weeks ago when they were running a 2 for 1 special. She proceeds to explain that because she was on her way to driving school, she wasn't able to take advantage of the free second drink because she didn't think it would be a good idea. So now she would like her free drink, even though the special is not being offered on that day and she never asked for a rain check when this supposedly happened several weeks ago. The bar tender went and asked the owner, who happened to be working that night. The owner came up and explained that it was several weeks ago and they don't remember her saying anything about it before that, so they wouldn't give her another free drink. Honestly, I think she was just trying to scam them out of a free drink, because she already seemed sauced. I think they could sense the same thing, and her attitude wasn't helping to convince them either. 

She continued arguing with him, and then she told him ""A free drink is a small price to pay for customer loyalty."" While she may have a point, the tone of entitlement and this lady's attitude was just disgusting. After hearing that, there was no way in hell the owner was going to let her have a free drink. You should have seen her. She pushed her plate aside and started pouting. When a waitress came by and asked her if she needed a box to go, she said, ""No, leave it. I want them to see it. I won't be coming back here again."" I couldn't help over hearing, and I laughed out loud. She glared over at us. The bar tender came over, and before she could get another complaint out of her mouth she took the plate and dumped the food into the trash, handed her the check and walked away. I remember a funny incident with a rather paranoid waitress in a good, local pizza place some years ago.  I walked in at the same time as some random guy.  I got my table, he got his.  I ordered my pizza, he ordered his.  

The pizza was fantastic (as usual for this place).  I was halfway through my food when it started slowly dawning on me that this might be a different pizza than I had ordered.  

I was about a quarter-ways into this dawning process when the waitress RAN out into the dining room and threw a complete terrified fit because she had accidently switched our orders.  

Random guy said ""Wow, I hardly noticed, it was so good.""  I said, ""Yeah, this one isn't bad either!""

Well, the waitress didn't seem to notice that both me and Mr. Random were both pretty cool about the whole thing.  She continued to panic and apologize up down and sideways.  

I finally said:  ""How about we both decide that I was a complete bitchy thing about it and so you were forced to give me a free chocolate brownie?"" Then I grinned at her.

Waitress looked relieved and said ""I can do that!""  She then turned to Random Guy and asked ""Would a brownie work for you?""  He said ""Sure!"" 

That was fun.  I left a large tip just to be nice. 

The next time I was there, she ""messed up"" again by not charging me for my beverage.  I was wondering why she kind of grinned at me sideways as she wrote down my drink choice.  Niceness actually works.   :)
Secret fun fact: Being NICE to your cashiers/sales associates/waiters/etc will make it MORE likely for you to get what you want... but shhhhhAs a (former, for the moment) retail cashier, I can pretty much say that 

> as he will not want others to be put off by your fit

is hilarity waiting to happen.

Also, fuck you, Cosmo: no receipt, no returns.  This is the rule, you will follow it.A big fuck you to Cosmo trying to teach fraud like it's some kind of legitimate avenue for conducting business.Cosmo is the fucking worst. I honestly have trouble believing there are people stupid enough to take it seriously. They ALWAYS have a list of sex positions or whatever. one of them was, I shit you not, telling women to firmly grab the shaft of the penis with both hands and *twist in opposite directions.* They were telling people that men enjoyed indian burns on their dicks. Fucking hell. It pisses me off to no end that people get paid to write that shit.Fuck all those entitled pricks.  And fuck the managers that bend over backwards to enable their poor attitudes.  I work for a high traffic retail electronics store that may or may not be named after a fruit in the spoiled/entitled capital of America.

We were launching one of those fancy new phones that you may have heard about, and the line was something like 600 people long.  A mother and her daughter were in line, and they waited four hours to get in so that the kid (11 years old or so) could get a new phone.  Not her first, either, but an ""upgrade.""  So as they come in, the mother is kinda nice, the daughter is kinda snotty, and the step-father shows up out of nowhere just as they got to the front of the line.  He tells her he just got out of yoga, and so on and so forth.  

A little backstory on this guy.  He is a pretty powerful socialite/politician/industry player, and once tried to get us to open up the store after closing by slipping his black AmEx through the crack in the glass door.

So, with complete dread, I find out in the middle of the transaction that the family has a phone account that can't be handled by our store, only by the phone company itself.  The little girl starts crying.  The mom is upset cause, you know, the little girl MUST have the new trendy device or all the kids at school will make fun of her.  The step-dad starts getting heated, but just like something out of a movie, a famous athlete walks in, and the step-dad (who we will call ""B"") walks over to say hi, as they are buddies.  

The mom tells me that since I ""won't sell them the phone,"" I have to explain to her daughter why not.  Uhhh.  Ok.  So as I'm trying to figure out how to make this little brat stop crying because she can't have something that I, as an adult employee of the store, can't even afford myself, B comes back over and yells, ""BRING ME YOUR DAMN MANAGER.""  I tell him sure, and then he turns to his step-daughter and says, ""See that man over there?  That's [famous athlete].  Since he's more famous than I am, they can sell HIM a phone, but apparently I'm not quite important enough.""  At this point the wife tells me that ""I've really done it,"" because her husband is so important that terrible things are happening in the world just because he's too busy wasting his time with me.

My manager comes over, and B starts yelling at him.  In the meantime, I get the daughter to stop crying by guaranteeing her that if that famous athlete has the same issue as them, he won't get a phone either, and that I'm really sorry, but sometimes we can't get what we want, and we have to learn to live with it.  The mom looked at me like she couldn't believe that not getting what you want could even be a possible life outcome.  

I've been calm the whole time, been respectful the whole time, but then came the breaking point.  B starts yelling, and hollers, ""DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM?  I'VE BEEN STANDING IN LINE 4 HOURS AND I'M GETTING A GODDAMN PHONE.""

I calmly interjected.  

""No you haven't.""  He looked at me with pure hatred.
""EXCUSE ME?""
""You weren't in line for four hours.  Your wife and step-daughter were.  You were at yoga.  I don't give a shit who you are, don't lie to my boss in front of me and think I'm going to let it slide.""  I have never in my life seen someone explode with fury the way I saw B do right then.  
""WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?  WHAT'S YOUR NAME?  I KNOW [fill in the name of dynamic cult leaderish CEO] PERSONALLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT I'M MEETING WITH HIM MONDAY AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE YOU GET FUCKING FIRED.""  Keep in mind this is all happening in a tiny store filled with hundreds of people.

I kept my cool while B pulled out a piece of paper and a pen to write down my name, and I calmly told him my last name was European so I would spell it out for him.  He didn't quite know what to make of that.  

Nothing ever happened to me for that, but fast forward a year later, and he sat through one of my workshops about how to use [insert trendy photo software].  He didn't remember me.  Also, I think he was coked up.

TL;DR...Fuck entitled pricks.I hope that article was titled ""How to Be a Raging Bitch in Public"". Also, this might work on a salesperson who gets a direct commission off the sale, but clerks at places like Target or Best Buy don't give a damn how much you think you spend. They'll be fine without your business.""Company policy"" stonewall, it's super effective.I was at work in an ER when a 50 something woman brought her 70 something mother into the hospital because she passed out in the car after she bought groceries. All the daughter could talk about was how the store better refund her several hundred dollars for the now ruined groceries because they sat in her car while her sick elderly mother lay in our ER. I could not believe the kahoonas this woman had. What responsibility does the grocery store have to you because an unfortunate event happened to a family member?? I could never imagine going to the grocery store and telling them that, I would expect they laugh in my face. What a weasel, I'm assuming and hoping they didn't give her a dime back.

I work in tech support. A few years back Oprah mentioned on air that you should immediately ask for a tier 2 agent or a supervisor to get ""better service"". Seemingly overnight every 3rd or 4th soccer mom was refusing to speak to me and extremely minor issues were being escalated up for no reason, wasting everyone's time.

Thanks Oprah!People are just not used to hearing the word no. Ever. And then they go on to be parents and are incapable of saying no to their kids. I broke up with girlfriends in the past because they read cosmo and listened to the advices in thereWow, teaching people to be bigger assholes than they already are?  Yeah, 'cause the rude need more reason to be rude.

I caption *Oh So Cosmo*, and they've done a lot to set back the womens' movement, which won't surprise anyone.  But to tell people to amp up their inherent rudeness?  These people must be stopped.>If he's a rookie, he may not ask for the receipt.

Uh, no. From my experience working retail, when I was new somewhere I was more likely to go by the book because I didn't know which rules were ok to break and which rules would cost me my job. 

>""I spend a lot of money here, but if you can't help me, I'll take my business elsewhere"".

I hate this mindset. It is not 1965 anymore! Your cashier is not being paid enough to care! And chances are nowadays that are you are shopping at a store that is part of a corporate chain that has hundreds, if not thousands of stores across the country. So it won't matter if you take your business elsewhere, because there's 10 people in line behind you who don't give a shit about what's going on right now and there's probably 5 other stores in a 10 mile radius. Former retail cashier/manager here (7 years on the job):

- Absolutely not. When people get loud they just want attention. I'm even *less* inclined to break policy when someone is in my face screaming about it.

Funny story: second day on the job, first real job ever. Man comes up with an invalid coupon. I tell him I can't accept this, he ask for the manager. The shift manager walks up and she figures out what's going on.

Apparently this guy is a regular. He blast away at her while I'm standing there (poker face) just taking the heat. He finally states ""Where is it, in writing, that you can't take this [coupon]... in writing!!!???"" 

She runs my receipt paper roll, tears off about a foot of it and writes in black permanent marker; ""WE WON'T TAKE THIS CRAP"". She folded her arms and stared him down-like a boss.

edit for context: The coupon was printed off a site that tells people how to scam retail stores. I learned very quickly and my skin hardened to titanium over the next year.I think it's awesome that some retailers will give me store credit without a receipt... but I *never* expect that nor would I make a complete fool of myself like that. I've seen grown adults throw temper tantrums like that and I applaud any clerk/cashier/what-have-you who *doesn't* give in to that kind of behavior.

Oh, and fuck Cosmo.WOW. Is this *this* month's issue? Can we all write Cosmo a nice little [letter](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/contribute/magazine/appear-in/this-months-issue)?I used to work in retail...
