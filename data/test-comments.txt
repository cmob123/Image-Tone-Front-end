Wow.  He died protecting priceless antiquities from destruction, something he definitely believed in.  Sad for him to die but certainly honorable for him to die with his convictions.
The man was 82 years old and brave as fuck. RIP.
This is so heartbreaking. His love for the Palmyra Antiquities surpassed his love for his own life.

I hope that wherever he goes, he's rolling in antiquities and unbelievable treasures.  
Here's a story. 

The New York Times: ISIS Beheads Syrian Antiquities Scholar. http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5JqtgyU
...why can't the entire world be more successful against ISIS... the news about them is always so frustrating and infuriating
It breaks my heart so much history is being destroyed. Especially since that area (Iraq, Iran, etc) is literally like the cradle of civilization and there's SO MUCH priceless stuff there. It's truly a terrible thing.
When you feel threatened by ancient monuments, dead gods and archeologists, you're in the wrong and so is your ideology.
[This is Tomislav Salopek, 31, father of two, Croatian] (http://static.klix.ba/media/images/vijesti/b_150813104.jpg), beheaded by ISIS a week ago, because, well, ISIS likes to behead people
RIP Khaled Assad. You died a more honorable man than those who killed you. 
Thank you khaled. You're a hero to history.
Most news stories failed to say why he was murdered. The man was a hero who sacrificed himself to protect his lifetime of work. 

It's long passed time for the surrounding Muslim countries, who have millions of soldiers in their armies, to come together and put an end to these monsters once and for all.  
I know Isis are shitheads but why do they destroy ancient buildings and antiques?
R.I.P. man of ethics and morality.
Perhaps some of the powerful sovereigns in regions **SHOULD STEP THE FUCK UP** and save their culture and history before it's wiped out by these assholes.


It's hard for me to be upset about this anymore.

I'm absolutely shocked at the loss of priceless history and the barbarism to kill this man over this, but if no one in the Middle East wants to stop ISIS, then I say the West should pull out, and let them have their cake.

There's no way we, with a foreign modern military, can go into a region like the Middle East and solve these problems by killing people.

Our foreign military can support and assist in a force led by a local sovereign, but we cannot lead a war over there and come out the winner, nor accomplish anything effective.

People have the right to self determination. If those people in the territory now controlled by ISIS, and those sovereigns around them want to allow ISIS sovereign control, so be it.
**NEW GAME:** No more need to hunt and kill secondary game like lions and rhinos.  It's time to drop all of the poachers into ISIS territory armed to the teeth and wearing GoPros with instructions to bring back their heads as trophies.  Poach for your life baby!
Fuck You ISIS!
Wow.

RIP.
As a historian I am really feeling that it is time for us to organize and begin seriously defending these sites. This man died with honor. I hope he finds peace. 
Will somebody plz take out those piece of shit fucktards? 
I hope if I ever face my own death like that I can have half the balls this guy did and tell them fuck right off. This guy is a hero and died as honorable a death as any man could hope for, die protecting and defending what you love and lived for.
I was talking with a lot of redditors yesterday trying to understand how ISIS is able to recruit and hold so much control if seemingly no one supports them. 

The common answer from Muslims was that "more Muslims support ISIS than are willing to admit it publicly".  And that "even if they don't actively support them, they tacitly support them by secretly agreeing with their actions". 

That was concerning to me, and as much as I hate to agree with GW Bush, I can kind of start to see the logic of his "If you aren't with us, you're against us" comment. 

Seeing people like this man, get beheaded for such a noble cause kind of highlights for me how terribly evil this group is.  If you even *remotely* support what these people are doing, fuck you. 

This truly is a point in time where everyone needs to clearly pick a side. This is the kind of shit that we as a society can't tolerate. 
I guess real life is not like a movie. I wonder if he spent his last seconds wondering if someone would come to save him. I hate when good people have to die like this. 
fucking savages

RIP, real man
Alpha as Fuck. ISIS - Tell us where you have the shit hid. Kahled - Fuck You.
I hope that I would have the Balls to protect my life's work.
It's tragic that it often takes such villains to show us who the heroes are.

It is my dream to one day be damned to hell by Tom Hanks.
For those who may not know....Tom Hanks *loves* typewriters. He owns several hundred and has them displayed all across Playtone (his production office). They are all in pristine condition and don't look like they've aged a day. 

His entire production office is loaded up with fantastic memorabilia. Lots of pop culture and incredible pieces from the forties, fifties, and sixties. The man's loaded with taste and class.

And as you may well know he happens to be one of the nicest, kindest, most genuine guys in the business. 
[link to the resulting interview podcast](http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/nerdist-podcast-tom-hanks/) for the lazy.
Tom Hanks. It's impossible for that guy to get any more likable. He's a national treasure.

 We should just give him a standing position in every Presidential cabinet. Secretary Hanks. Department of Tom Hanks.  
For those who would like to know what it looks like [here](http://sevenels.net/typewriters/large/SCProtoSterling33.jpg) is the closest i can find from their [website](http://sevenels.net/typewriters/s-coronas.htm). Or possibly [this](http://sevenels.net/typewriters/large/CoronaFourflattop.jpg). both from around the same era.
Today on reddit, internet superstar Chris Hardwick casually posts that he sent ultra-man Tom Hanks a typewriter.
Mr. Hanks was absolutely delightful on the podcast, as well. Seems like a pretty solid human being. 
Now I feel kinda jerky for expecting all celebrities to be out-of-touch douche torpedoes. 
[Hey! Here's a more thorough account of the letter with pics of the typewriter and the invitation if anyone gives a care](http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/the-tom-hanks-typewriter-saga/)
This totally fits my "Tom Hanks is awesome" theory. And my "Chris Hardwick is awesome" theory. Today's a big day for theories.
Tom Hanks should rent himself out to make appearances at parties. I don't see how this could ever go wrong. Ever.
TIL Chris Hardwick is a redditor.
To which you reply ["THanks, THanks!"](http://i.imgur.com/tYLoj.jpg)
Brilliant.
Reason 378473854859843843985 to love Tom Hanks
This isn't even beginning to load for me, I guess since so many people are accessing the image, does anyone have a transcript?


Edit: nevermind, it loaded for me, so here's a transcript:

           Film Television Music Typewriters

    Dear Chris, Ashley, and all the diabolical genuies at Nerdist Industries.

    Just who do you think you are to try to briibe me into an appearance on your
    'thing' with this gift of the most fantastic Cornona Silent typewriter made in 1934?

    You are out of your minds if you think... that I... wow, this thing has great action...
    and this deep crimson color... Wait! I'm not so shallow as to... and it types nearly
    silently...

    Oh, OKAY!

    I will have my people contact yours ad work out some kind of interview process...

    Damn you all to hell,

Tom Hanks
Link to the podcast:

http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/nerdist-podcast-tom-hanks/
Tom's episode of the podcast was one of the best in recent memory. Nothing will top the Henry Rollins episode, though. That shit was a revelation.
Not sure if this was it, but in case I'm not the only one curious about what the [typewriter](https://www.smithcorona.com/blog/smith-corona-virtual-typewriter-museum/post-merger-office-machines-interwar-period/) looked like.
Awesome post, but just curious... how in the hell does this have over 10,000 *net* upvotes??? The most I've ever seen is like, maybe 3000 or 4000, and generally the top posts on the front page have about 2000, right? Isn't there some sort of algorithm that balances out ridiculous amounts of upvotes with downvotes or something?
That is classy sir. Straight up Classy.
Im not even going to whore my username for karma, I just want to say Tom Hanks is the greatest American Actor to ever live.
We should print his face on money.
Looks like your invitation was just his type.
I call Shenanigans: That signature clearly says "Tom Hanly".


I read the entire thing in his voice.
And what a podcast it was. Good job Nerdist. My goal of hearing Tom Hanks tell funny stories was realized and made last night a pretty good one. Thank you for that.

"Is it humane keeping them locked in there like that?"

"Don't worry, the keepers did a great job recreating their natural office habitat." 

"But don't they get agitated being stared at all day?"

"No, they think it's a one-way mirror, which makes them less creeped out for some reason"


I have similar windows right next to my desk, every day a female cardinal lands on the window sill and looks at herself for several minutes, sometimes pecking at her image.  Usually the male eventually sees her and starts singing at her until she turns and they fly off.   I always imagine him yelling "C'mon, you look fine!, We have to go, we're going to be late!"

We never got deer, but we definitely got a lot of people stopping to fix their hair, a few fixing makeup and one muscly asian guy who danced while staring at himself for about five minutes.

Probably the best and cruelest use of it was gluing a coin to the pavement.
They suck when geese or swans nest by them, the dumb things see their reflections and think that it's a rival, and peck at the windows.

It's like being in a zoo, only that they are free and you are caged.
He's mirin them antler gains. 
Doesn't always work like that. We have the same windows around the building I work at. A deer charged at the glass and broke through. Spent the next few hours running around the building spewing blood on everything.
I used to think that too until we had an aggressive seagull trying to fight his reflection in our window.  He would peck his reflection for hours and hours every day for weeks.
My grandparents used to have a house in Tucson with one-way windows. Every morning we would wake up to a family of quails banging their heads against the window, I assume to beat up the other, identical family of quails who were invading their turf.

Quails are not so smart.

I worked in my university's print shop full-time, sweet deal, free tuition and they let me leave for three hours each day, with pay, to attend one class plus I was on campus for the evening class as well.  Anyway, our print shop was mostly underground but had these windows where you could look up to the sidewalk.  There was a railing just above and a lot of students would lean on the railing.  I had six student aides working for me and Jesus Christ did they ever stare up the skirts through that window all damn day.  I never did because I'm just not that type of guy.  I ended up taping cardboard over the windows between semesters so the next batch of aides didn't know any better, but sure enough those guys had already heard about the perk and tore down my cardboard.
Expected two hobos fucking.  Was pleasantly surprised.
Its great until someone stores their dildo against the window.
That ain't no deer I ever seen. Where is this?

OK kripp
Nice!  I just ordered a [one-way mirror birdhouse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M8BVKZS/) last week in an attempt to provide some daytime entertainment for my cats :)  I hope it works just as well!

My eighth grade teach told me that Mt. Fuji was 12,365 feet tall.  He said I'll never forget that because there are 12 months in the year, and 365 days.  And now you'll never forget it either.

The lonely mountain*
So many lovelies.
Are all the surrounding mountains an old gigantic crater?? I need to research this....
Looks like a zit needs to be popped. 
I've always appreciated the beauty and majesty of Mount Fuji (like so many others), but I've never really known about it's... context. It's truly breathtaking to see it from this vantage. I want to say more nice things, but honestly, I'm pretty stunned.

Thanks for sharing!
It sucked to climb it.

I felt like I was dying.

You should climb it though. 
It looks like someone needs to make a suitably sized golf ball and tee off!
Is that urban infrastructure on upper right?  Looks like mud flowing through a canyon.
Source? I am skeptical that is from the space station.
Any geologists around these parts that could ELI5 the nature of Fuji's prominence? From this angle, it almost looks like the mountain is contained in a giant crater!
Grand on extreme scale

That sounds like the moral of "The Lego Movie."  
So, I'm a huge Lego nerd, and I'm drunk. Drunk enough to open a sealed set I have from 1981 to see if there was anything like this in that set.
  
There wasn't. There was a note to parents, but it didn't express anything about gender.
  
But it was cool to see these Legos that haven't been opened since 1981. I mean shit, I was 2-3 when this was on store shelves. The brick walls are thicker than they are today. But the sets today are better by far. AND SPCAE LEGO!!! Shit, that brings me back. I mean, my whole Lego room brings me back, but to see ads in the booklet brings me back.
  
You motherfuckers want proof??? Here's the opened. box.

And you know what? Who gives a shit? When I have the privilege of having kids, Ima teach them to do whatever the fuck they want, but they gotta learn both jobs. My girls will know how to change a tire, and my boys will know how to make bathrooms smell like lemons. Pink Lego, boy Lego, fuck it! Boys play with Barbies, girls play with GI Joe, I'll make fun of them for playing with lame toys, not for playing with the wrong gender toy.
  
The fucking Danish got it right with Lego, and Danishes, and they're right. Who gives a fuck?! Maybe they thought by 1981, when this set was made, that they didn't need to insert pamphlets telling parents to not be assholes. Because rthe Danish weren't assholes in 1981.
  
Lego rules. Build whatever the fuck you wanna build, and don't be a dick parent telling your kids what to build. Fuck you and your dying asshole ways. WHO WANTS TO COME OVER AND DRINK AND BUILD WHATEVER THE FUCK??!?!?!!?
  
edit: you want more pictures of the box? just ask. I'll be up for a while.
  
EDIT: Okay, now I'm awake and sober, and can asses what I have done. The set isn't really that valuable, and I got it as part of a massive 390 set haul last year. I kept it for its historical value. The pieces are bagged in the perforated bags from back in the day, and they make that distinctive sound when you shake them. I love that sound. All I did was cut one of the seals to open it, and I don't regret it. This set is a time capsule and should be opened to see that booklet.

Source, but in German:

This is an English version of the 1974 German pamphlet found [here](http://www.redshift.com/~shifflett/lego/German_catalog_1974/). The English cover with the blonde girl can be seen [here](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?C=c74ukhom). The blurry numbers on the bottom match: 97880-Eng.

This sucks balls. I tried to enter a Lego building competition at a local mall. I was a skinny little kid with long blonde hair. They told me that "girls weren't allowed to enter". I'm still emotionally damaged from that one, cos I was a Lego master.
I'm a girl...and I wanted pink Legos. Why didn't they have pink Legos when I was a kid? Why is that so hard? 
Can anyone else make out what's written [on the back of the sheet](http://i.imgur.com/y5yLayE.png)?

Shouldn't it be "A doll's house" with a possessive apostrophe?

Gonna be honest, that paper doesn't look 40 years old
That's back when Lego was Lego. You want a spaceship? Alright kiddo, here's a bunch of rectangles, build it yourself.

These days? Snap together a handful of specialised, branded, one-off bits to mimic the latest movie tie-in.
OP. For the love of god be careful. You're standing in an active minefield and you decide to take a picture for karma?!
Not saying it must be the case, but to me it feels like someone just created this himself, but to put a more weight on his moral message he's claiming it's official message from Lego.

+add bunch of lego bricks in the background and it's 100% legit.

Where I went in China, along their high speed rail system, 2 minutes outside any major city and all you see for the next few hundred miles are farms just like this one. They lack the blue roofs that most of the farms I saw, though.

Man, I posted almost the same pic. Also from Chile. Here, I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROxKaPgfkYA)
holy fuck that's awesome in the strictest sense of the word.
This gave me the brilliant idea, Minecraft should have volcanoes. 
Any idea what kind of eruption it is, or what they expect the damage to be? My knowledge of volcanos is the 10 minutes I spent reading about them in my Geology lab last week.
Holy shit that's stunning.
[You're all right, OP](http://i.imgur.com/zR284NK.jpg)
That is insane.  Wait am I seeing this on Reddit before I am hearing about it on the news?  Holy crap I need to get off of here NOW.  And you need to get out of there NOW!
*OP* definitely knows how to volcano. 
I have some family staying in Pucón and they're just sleeping through the eruption. 

I stayed in Pucón a couple of years ago and the volcano is really close. The Chileans are either brave or just plain crazy. 
That's crazy! We were on top of that bad boy on our last trip there. Peeking right into the lava-mouth! https://www.dropbox.com/s/1p5kgn31du8km7t/Chile_225.JPG?dl=0

Could someone please photoshop the plate out so it looks like he is about to eat his daughter? It's just begging to be done.
10 years later: "Dad, why do I have a 4 point scar in my back?"
Does bringing a child into the world automatically bestow a person with perfect balance? Seriously. I see moms/dads balancing a baby in one hand at my job, and groceries + a toddler in the other, like no big deal. I can't even carry a full cup of coffee. WHAT IS THE DEAL, PARENTS.
Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. 

One daddy to another: please consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradle them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could get any sleep. 

If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. 

Also: take naps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing. Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. 

After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause both of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your wife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. 

Make sure you have infant Tylenol, baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infants, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all times* when you leave the house with the baby. 

You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. 

Keep a cloth diaper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed for work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the diaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean driveway. 

And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or professional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all just stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.

EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommending baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash cream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner "<name of baby> has a rash on his/her ash", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of being a daddy and you might as well get used to it now. 
id be scared shitless of dropping the baby, trying to catch it, forgetting i was holding a fork, and then stabbing the baby mid drop.
A little bit of Velcro and you're ready for an infomercial.

My daughter used to be like this. Sleeping like a lazy leopard puts pressure on her tummy and lets the wind out. Try burping her for a bit longer after a feed, or massage her tummy, 20 circular rubs (clockwise to help digestion).

Also, I once saw a woman breastfeed both of her twins at once, whilst chowing down on a big ham sandwich. I was very impressed!
I usually carry them the opposite way (because head is heavier than butt and it simply feels safer). http://imgur.com/f3Lt5
I'm a Mom/Baby nurse.  The first week is definitely the worst.  Baby is programmed to eat every hour or two, mom's milk supply isn't entirely in yet, and you are so sleep-deprived you'd smack your mama in the face to get a 2-hour nap.  It will get better.  I admire your ingenuity.
And people say men can't multitask!
Try eating with a 32lb 1.5 year old on your left arm, and a 36 lb 3.5 year old on your right arm.  You have to depend on them to feed you properly, in this case.  So once they stop fighting each other, maybe they'll feed daddy.  

BTW, how do you fathers of multiple children deal with , say one is 1.5 years old, barely understanding things, but quite feisty.  Doesn't understand that the 3.5 year old has his toys that she cant touch.  But she doesn't understand this yet.  She only knows to give it back to him when he starts crying for it.  But he gets impatient and starts sacking her, at that point she will refuse to give it back and fight back.... how do I end this????  should i?  should I make him share? 

I've been telling my older son to give her one of her own toys whenever she wants to take one of his.  Or to trade for something he's not using doesn't want..  But he's still very possessive of his own toys.  
Glad you weren't hungry for hot soup.
My son is the same, only fall a sleep when i carry him on my arm.
Pro tip: Turn the baby around. Keep her shoulder as high up on your arm as you can (by the elbow, where her bum is now in the picture, or even higher up). 
This will be easier for you as all her weight is really in her head, and when she gets heavier you will feel the difference. 
Also it's safer (in my opinion). You can hold her thigh real easy with your hand. Instead of her head, so if she moves you won't have to stress her neck. 
Check this image: http://i.imgur.com/U3tm5.png
See how he holds the thigh? thats the secret to it beeing really comfortable, since you can have your other hand kinda free.
It's recommended that you put your other hand ontop of the child any way, but when you feel you got the hang of it. Youll notice how good it feels.
Have you thought of swaddling? works like a charm for little babies. I had preemie twins and it was a life saver.

Don't let her get used to that bro, she'll end up one of those girls you can eat sushi off of...
Man, I haven't laughed at a photo like that in the longest time. She looks like an awesome little chipmunk and I'm sure she'll appreciate you rocking that pic at her 21st birthday party. Congrats man.


A real man is not defined by macho bull shit.  A real man is a man who puts the needs of his children and family before his own.  The sacrificial man. I didn't figure this out until I had children of my own.

It is the innocence of children that forges a mans true strength. But I didn't need to say it. It is clear from the photo that you already understand.

Congratulations your daughter is beautiful and she is lucky to have you as a father.

Dump 3 large puzzles (5,000 piece or more each) into one bag. Give the bag as a gift without the pictures or any info that there's more than one puzzle in it. Puzzle people love that kind of thing. 
Years ago my uncle gave my parents a puzzle called "spilled milk" that was also all white pieces, just without any straight edge pieces (the whole puzzle makes up shape of a puddle of milk). Next challenge??
I'm stealing this from the podcast Totally Laime - it's how the hosts got engaged...

If/when you're proposing to her, have a photo of you guys printed and made into a jigsaw...

Have a ring photoshopped onto her finger, but keep that piece out of the box. 

So, she puts together the whole thing together, apart from that one piece... gets frustrated that the piece is missing... and then you 'find' that piece and hand it to her.


32000 pieces

https://www.vat19.com/item/worlds-largest-jigsaw-puzzle

> Those of you brave (or should we say crazy?) enough to attempt the World's Largest Puzzle will find it takes about 900 hours to complete.
That's impressively fast
How does she even know where to begin?!
Well it shows exactly where each piece goes right on the box, how hard is that?
real question is what did she do with it after it was done??
I enjoyed your responses to things in this thread more then I did looking at the picture of the puzzle haha.

OP is a good guy. 
one time I really, really didn't like this girl I knew.   she was mean.  she deserved it.   just a really awful person I promise you would agree.

I found myself in her house one time and she had a puzzle she was working on her kitchen table about half completed.  I took one piece and put it in my pocket.

really she was bad, yall.
there's nothing funny about autism.
Get her [one of these](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stave_Puzzles).  They're "trick" puzzles. Some have open spaces in the middle of the puzzle, some have multiple solutions where only 1 makes the correct picture. 
Is [this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1287945120_rainman.jpg) your girlfriend?
My sister likes puzzles. 

This is now in her future.

i've owned this puzzle for two years and rage quite every time

Parents: Haha, she'll get a kick out of this!

Girlfriend: http://i.imgur.com/rWWPeDM.gifv
Step 1: Get a few bowls of paint of different colors.

Step 2: Dismantle the puzzle and shuffle the pieces.

Step 3: Dip the pieces in paint at random and let them dry.

Step 4: Put it back together.

Step 5: Frame the art.
Get her a job doing VLSI layout.  She'll get to do this kind of task all day long and get paid well for doing so.
Your GF should open a bar.

And the name of that bar?

People will be like, "Why is it called Puzzles?"

It looks like controls from a budget spaceship movie
Well,  talk us through it then.  What do all the buttons and levers do? 
Couple years ago when my son was a toddler he was obsessed with garbage trucks, absolutely in love with them.  Every Friday morning we would sit on the balcony of our 3rd story apartment and watch the big ole WM truck come empty out the dumpsters and my son was just captivated, no matter how many times he had seen them before.

Now my parents lived in a little town about 35 minutes away, and we would visit them at least once a week.  My folks are oddly generous and every week when the garbage men come through their neighborhood my mom will go out there and give them all cold bottles of water, gatorade or soda.  Its just a little thing that has endeared my parents to the garbage men.  

Well just so happens that my sons 3rd bday fell on whatever day of the week was garbage day in my folks neighborhood.  While we were at their house the garbage truck comes rumbling along.  I ran out there as my mom was getting them their drinks and explained that my son just loved the shit out of garbage trucks and offered them $20 to let us have a little ride around the neighborhood.  

The driver refused the money but took us around the neighborhood anyway.  I gave the money to his partner and told him to go have a few rounds on me after work.   For the next year everytime they saw my son and I they would give us a ride, all in all we had 3 ride alongs.   

There's not really a point to this story, other than OPs pic brought back one of my favorite memories of all time.  My son was so god damn excited, but also felt pretty special, which of course made my week.
I see "JAG OFF" stickers...Pittsburgh? 
Do you like your job? I've been thinking about being a garbage man. 
What cool stuff have you found?
i'm not sure if you're aware of this...but both of my children LIVED for garbage day when they were small.  they would loose it when they heard the truck and we would run out (no matter what state we were in) to stand on the porch and watch.  we would always say hello and chat briefly with the guys.  (never a lady on my route).  so i'm not sure if you know, but you are ACTUAL heros to many kids out there.  they love you.  
what's in the bag?
This guy has GOT TO BE from Pittsburgh. The "jag off" is strong in this truck...

That and "the shocker"...
So instead of giving my trash men beer for the holidays, I should just give them cool stickers for the inside of the truck? I can do that.
"Stay Drunk." Probably not the best sticker to have in your truck. 
How comfortable is it sitting in there?

lots of people like to think their jobs are important but aren't.  If I didn't go to work for a week who would care?  realistically....no one.  If a garbage man didn't go to work for a week....FUCKING CHAOS.
[removed]
what country? i used to work as a garbagetruckman in sweden and ours were a whole lot more modern than that, also ended up making them personalized, not so much with stickers but with other things.

remember hooking up a stereo-speaker system to the rear and connecting it to the musicplayer so we didnt miss the song/the radio speaker when getting off to work.

you make surprisingly much as a garbageman in sweden too. i made roughly twice the national average a month from the garbageman job and i finished so early i could have a second part-time job after. worked between 6-10 (rouhly, we got off work when finished with our route, also sometimes had slightly earlier hours) and then had a second work starting at 1pm.

ironically you end up making almost three times swedens national average as a garbageman that way, which is fun because everyone treats you as if you're below them somehow, if only they knew.

also, note to americans, we make very little money in sweden (made up for by a lot of things being "free" etc) so the national average monthly salary is "just" 2500 a month, however this is enough to have a lower middleclass lifestyle, so it is comparable with "a lot" more by US standard of salary.

however, if you have a high paying job in sweden (4000 usd +) you would be better off as an american, as the swedish system is less rewarding when you succeed but gives you more room to succeed.

anyway, just my story.

tl;dr

garbagemen can make 6000+ usd monthly, where as swedens national average is 2500 usd monthly.
You from Pittsburgh? We're going to the cup ya Jag
Haha love the Edelbrock and Summit stickers, now I'm imagining a garbage truck with a scoop and dual 4 barrel high-rise carbs tearing ass through the neighborhood scaring all the children.

Which part of Pittsburgh do you service? 
I'm surprised they let you decorate it so much like that. I've driven company owned vehicles, they wouldn't even let me hang something off the rear view mirror or get hooker blood on the backseat.

 you climbed mt. Fuji 4 times? I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to get myself off the couch to turn on the light 
Great shot.  I really only began to appreciate Mt. Fuji when I saw [this picture of Mt. Fuji from space](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Mt_Fuji_NASA_ISS002-E-6971_large.jpg) that was on the front page not long ago.
I bet the people that live in it's shadow get mocking phone calls from their non-shadowed neighbors remarking on how beautiful the sunrise is nearly every morning. 

"Isn't this time a day just lovely? Oh, is it still dark over there? Hahahaha, light sides rule!"
very cool, here's [a little bigger version](http://www.krisjbphotography.com/japan/9m8th9d5tf2f00nz1asfl6lh5nqvlf)
i climbed it twice , picture of my first sunrise on top : http://i.imgur.com/c0bm9yP.jpg
It's amazing to me how much of a perfect triangle its shadow makes. How steep is the ascent? 
I know this isn't an AMA, but what was it like?  And what were the best and worst parts of climbing it (4 times)?
IIRC there is a Japanese proverb that everyone should climb Fuji San once but only a fool does it twice : )

PS:  great photo
Psh ... I climbed Mt. Fuji for the *first* time last week and [got this pic](http://i.imgur.com/32d3ZBF.jpg). Let's call it a tie.
I climbed it last week when I was visiting Japan.  It was one day before the supposed typhoon.  Was at the summit at 4:30am and it was just a massive fog.  No light came through so no good shots could be had...  Got some great night shots on the tripod but no sun rise.
Hey, really nice shot! [I got a similar result on Mt. Meru in Tanzania](http://i.imgur.com/QOMhvx4.jpg). I had clouds though :(
When I climbed Fuji many years ago there was an old man right at the top (somehow connected to the Udon shop up there) and when he saw our foreign faces he laughed at us and said:

"Wise man climbs Mt. Fuji... Only fool climbs Mt. Fuji twice!".

Is it true?
Wife of OP here, glad so many of you appreciate his work. I was there when he took the damn thing--trust me, it's freezing on top, I just wanted my husband to cuddle with me and he just had to go to the tip top and take photos as always--so if you are interested in the photo, or you would like to repost it, or reblog it, please can you link back to either his Flickr or his website:

4 is an unlucky number in Japan. You better climb another time.
Did the tip of the shadow appear to be moving pretty fast from your vantage point? 
I got incredibly lucky during my ascent. Only did it once, but it was September so not crowded at all and the weather was perfect.

Here's an excellent explanation from NASA:

http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/30may_solareclipse2/

> "Solar images formed by pinholes, crossed fingers, patches between leaves, all occur because of diffraction--a wave property of light. In the case of a pinhole, the light rays do not shoot straight by the rim of the hole, but bend around the edge. This wave effect creates a diffraction pattern of rings on the screen which resembles a bull's eye. That's for a flat wave single light source. If the aperture is illuminated by a scene, it acts as a lens to image the scene on a screen. With the right size hole relative to the right distance to a screen, a clear image is formed. That's the general principle of a pinhole camera."
> 
> "Applying this to an eclipse observation, the sun becomes the object to view. Point the pinhole camera at the sun and you see a solar image (projected on a screen) dim enough your eyes can enjoy."
> 
> "But the pinhole effect doesn't need a designed aperture. The solar image can be formed by any aperture if the shadow is the right distance away. The sunrays though tree leaves work to make a solar image on the ground below. Blinds on the window will covert a square opening into a round sun on the wall."
> 
> "The marvel is that diffraction doesn't need a round hole to form an image. A square pinhole will also work if its area is the same. Even for a random edged shape, the wave bending will average out to form an image of the scene contained in the incident light. That's why the spots of light through the trees are round; the gaps in the foliage are imaging the sun. "
I... Don't understand how the sun being partially blocked would change the shadows that a tree casts.
Who's the dipshit building attack-speed Soraka?
That's an amazing shot! The tree leaves act similar to how pinhole cameras work, [leaving these little eclipse casts](http://i.imgur.com/Y20dSSJ.png)
Go see for yourself during the [next eclipse](http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html) near you.
For those doubting, it [works like this.](http://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x400/pinholeprojectionpaper.jpg)
This guy. Think about all of the cameras pointed up at the moon when this was taken, and this smart guy is facing the opposite way.
The last time a total eclipse happened in my area, I was 7 or 8. We were in school and we all went out with our two pieces of paper to see the pinhole effect. I was a hyper kid and my teacher hated me so as soon I started to get the least bit out of hand she sent me to sit on the curb in the shade and miss the eclipse. I was super bummed seeing as how I really liked science stuff. As I sat there I started to notice all the shadows changing around me. It was like millions of little pinhole eclipses all around me. All of the rest of the class was out in the parking lot with their shitty paper pinholes but I had my own personal light show. It was cool as shit. Thanks for bringing back that memory OP. 
It happensh here in Shcotland, too. My ash looksh like a shilver-birch! 
http://imgur.com/ZSbxkuL
I know what's happening here! My physics teacher showed us an extremely similar photo. It's called a pinhole camera. The leaves in the tree have tiny little holes in them that the sunshine is passing through. This causes the image to be projected upside down on to the house like that. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera

Fun fact! If you wear glasses get a piece of paper and poke a tiny hole in it. Look through it without your glasses with one eye and you should be able to see clearly through the hole.
Pretty sure if you had a staff with a gem on it you could stick it in the ground and use mirrors to uncover ancient secrets
i saw this once in...1993 I think?  I was walking to class and saw half moons all over the sidewalk.  I knew right away what it was.

Luckily I was going to the engineering building and they has all kinds of stuff to look at it.  the best was looking through a compact disc.
toenail clippings...everywhere.
Looks like Porom and Palom just cast Flare
Also, during near-totality, overhead power and communication lines will throw sharp shadows. Normally they don't throw a shadow at all because they are much thinner than the sun's disk.
Photographer and light enthusiast here. What you're looking at here is the camera obscura effect. One of the most underrated and unheard of properties of light.
Huh, Oberon is real. Tenno unite!
I surely bet /r/mildlyinteresting will love this.
Trippy.
This looks like it was taken during the last big annular eclipse we got a few years ago.  

I am really excited that the US is actually going to be in the path of a total solar eclipse in August of 2017.  I will be making the trip to southern Illinois for that one, because it's probably the only total Eclipse that will ever cross this part of the earth in my lifetime.
That's fucking wild.
There is a Japanese word that describes this (minus the eclipse/banana part)- has not Direct English translated word.  [komorebi](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/181055/english-equivalent-of-komorebi-%E6%9C%A8%E6%BC%8F%E3%82%8C%E6%97%A5-sunshine-filtering-through-leaves)   
Damn physics, you crazy.
fucking use a coaster!!
I have seen this effect in person.  Eclipses are really strange and disconcerting.

When my company required proof of my cousin's death, I emailed a picture of the freshly covered plot.
Meanwile in Poland such a note is neccessary for every single missed sick day for every person. Milions of people in the waiting rooms each flu season wasting so much time health and money
I work in healthcare, in Nova Scotia. I wish I could see the signature, as I likely know the doctor in question!

My own GP hates requests for sick notes. I once called in sick a single time in a six month period, and was asked for a note. Spitefully, my GP wrote me off for three weeks in a glorious August, filling in the "reason for absence" section as "None of your goddamn business. Confidentiality trumps bullshit policy." That was the last time I was asked for a sick note.
 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! If you ever need health care in Halifax I'll be sure you get a real saline drip, not the bagged harbour water were usually use!
Yep I just show up sick, do a really half-assed job, spread the illness around then go home. The American way.
This is the perfect way to deal with that kind of policy.

Calm and understanding tone to maintain rapport. Expose the extra work and problems it causes. Mirror the absurdity by requiring an equally useless piece of work from them. Invoice them for the unnecessary cost. Appeal to the sense of community they (probably unknowingly) betray by outsourcing the cost of their organizational distrust for employees to other businesses.

Great lesson in diplomacy, right here.
I do find it kind of silly that companies require a Doctors note if you are sick.

My company does this and I always cringe when I have to tell the employee that policy requires a doctors note if they call in sick more than a day or two.
If someone has the flu, stay the hell home. I don't care, we'll figure shit out.
Sure if you tell me you have a physical injury, I need a note and instructions from your doctor on what you can do when you get back for those who have positions that require physical labour, but if you just had the flu? Stay the hell home, I don't really care.
In the end most of them are paid hourly, if it isn't busy season...you are saving me money.
It's more of a deterrent for people who BS sick days, but it doesn't really work there either. Since they'll find a doctor to fill that stuff out regardless, so you're just wasting everyones time.


My dad used to work in an ER in Nova Scotia. He said it was completely fucked. So many people with very minor issues clogging everything up.
Years ago I was a server and the flu hit me while I was working Handling food, drinks, silverware... GM sent me home seeing for himself I was really sick and said don't come in tomorrow. I was supposed to work the following 3 days. I did not show up the next day but by the third I was feeling better and came in. 

The MOD asked for my doctors note. I did not go to the doc nor could I afford the $150 to go to the walk-in clinic. She fired me on the spot leaving the floor short a server. 

The GM called 4 days later asking me WTF? I explained everything to him and he fired the MOD. 

EDIT: GM did not call me 4 days later but 4 days after the initial "go home you're sick". 1 day after the firing.
Good on that doctor. 
Fantastic. I remember waiting with my wife in a walk-in clinic for four hours so she could be seen for 2 minutes so she could buy a note from the doctor's office for a flu. Biggest waste of time ever, but her company required it
I got written up at an old job for refusing to give them a note. It was worth it to me- I'm not going to the doctor for a migraine, there's nothing they can do, it's just going to cost me more money on top of the money I'm losing by being unable to work.
Whats even stranger is friends and family telling me to see a doctor. Its a fucking cold!
That's the most Canadian "fuck you" I've ever seen. 
Bravo. Sick notes are for teenagers in high school, not middle aged employees. And they're nonsense anyway. I know what a 24hr stomach virus looks like. I know I don't need a doctor for it. Why the heck should I drag myself to a doctor's office unnecessarily just to appease my company's paranoia.
I work in a hospital, and the policy here is essentially "come in sick or it counts against you".  Obviously, they don't say that, and they don't want us to work while sick, but they still ding you for calling out (even with a doctor's note).

So, we work around sick patients, which means we're likely to get sick, and we're less likely to call out, so we're likely to make our co-workers sick.  The whole thing is stupid.
Instead of asking medical note because of abuse of sick leave benefit, why don't companies hire people they trust? 

If you trust your employees so little that you need to treat them like liars when they call in sick then you need to reconsider your hiring practices.
Good for that doctor. I despise the sick note policies that so many companies have.  

I was once so sick with the flu that I genuinely couldn't get out of bed to go see my doctor to get a note, so I went back a couple of days later when I was feeling better to ask her for the note my manager required. I obviously wasn't sick anymore, so she just asked me what dates I was sick and wrote the note accordingly.  

So clearly it doesn't matter if I'm actually sick or not, as long as my doctor will vouch for me. But I have to be a drain on the healthcare system either way. 
I worked for a retail art supply store, and they brought in a new manager who decided to implement a similar policy of requiring a note if you called in sick.  I told him it cost money and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket for something like that, especially because I had already lost a days wages (no sick days), and was only making $8.50/hour.  He said that I wouldn't be re-imbursed, so I said "no".  Nothing more was said. I like the doctors note though, anything which put the responsiblity for such a paternalistic, and wasteful policy back on the employer. 

Its ironic isn't it, an employer generally wants a note to make sure the employee isn't being irresponsible and playing hooky; but the reality is that the request itself is far more irresponsible in its actual effect when you consider the extra strain it puts on the health care system.  

TL; DR= The dr. nailed it.
I'm sorry, but screw demanding doctors' notes unless it's an extended illness.

"Oh, you're feeling sick today? NOW YOU MUST GO OUT OF YOUR HOME INSTEAD OF RESTING UP AND PAY A $50 COPAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING SICK."

How about, if you don't trust your employees enough to believe them when they call in, you're a moron for employing them?
I was home due to chicken pox this week and last week.

I work in IT, specifically as a senior DBA. I told them I would be out for 2 weeks but would be fully capable of working from home.

The following happened:

 - Boss required me to bring in a doctor's note with the diagnosis and expected return date.
 - Did not give me permission to work from home (yet made the expectation of such clear)
 - Made it quite clear that, in no uncertain terms, if I didn't have a note, I'd be dismissed for work abandonment.

I informed said boss that so long as I was chewing up sick time, I would not, for any reason what-so-ever, log into the VPN. At no point would I answer any pages nor emergency alerts. I informed him he was welcome to talk to HR / Legal about my stance and who was in the right.

This is the week that the cluster decided to have problems.

I can't wait to tell him that in another week I'm going to be out again for a gall bladder removal.

Like a dimestore hooker without any customers.
If my job search is any indication this letter will never get read by any human person and the Dr. will get an automated reply saying "thank you for applying but the position has already been filled."
Yeah that's bullshit. You're not a fucking child. 
Funniest part about sick notes is 99% of the time I'm sick because of the poor sanitation policies around your nasty work place.
Problem is call centres dont give a fuck. Its an awful place to work the company knows it is so they do this to prevent people from taking stress days and such because not having every possible person on the phones hurts their business. Every call centre says that they are better than the rest but all of them eventually treat you like numbers and not like human beings.
The best part here in the states is requiring a note when your company doesnt offer health insurance. Its such a big "fuck you" to your employees.

I remember hearing a story from a prof who supervised the build of a neutron activation reactor at my university. Basically a strongly emitting source of radiation is kept in a chamber with tubes leading through the chamber. Vials of samples get pushed into the chamber with an air shuttle kind of arrangement so they can get irradiated for analysis.

While the core of the reactor is housed in a heavy lead vessel, the rest of the reactor is made of cement with iron slugs used as aggregate instead of gravel. The iron chunks don't stop gamma emission as well as lead, but they do a better job than gravel.

One day, several trucks of cement were scheduled to begin casting of the walls of the core. The prof strenuously advised the construction foreman to only fill the trucks 1/3 full because the iron slugs would be considerably more dense than the aggregate they usually use. The foreman ignored the warnings, chalking them up as being the prattlings of an old naggy man and didn't give any orders to short fill the trucks. 

The trucks departed the cement plant charged with cement and iron aggregate and suffered eventual failure of all of their tires on the highway. They got stuck there loaded up with their massive overburdens of iron aggregate cement until their drum motors and bearings failed and the cement set inside the drums. They had to cut the drums apart off of the trucks  with plasma torches and jackhammers to clear up the heavy mess.
Got any more details on location?  I'm suddenly finding myself drawn to google maps....

It's the planted flag that really makes it.
Plot twist: it is an abandoned NASA capsule, and the cement truck is a cover story.
it's been there since the 50's but the edge of the road still looks like the wreck happened last week?  
Cement and concrete are not the same thing. That is a concrete truck. Think of it like a cookie; cement is flour, rock is chocolate chips and water is water. Would you call cookie dough flour! WOULD YOU!
A new pod has been found! We must claim it before the imperials do!
I heard the cement truck collided with a prison bus. Twelve hardened criminals escaped.
>too heavy to move

that's... not a thing. 

not since archemedius de grassroots einstein first yelled eureka.
Why was it too heavy to move? It was literally on something that moved it down the road.
Not even close to being too heavy to move. They just didn't want to deal with a crane.

On Florida's I-4 highway,  near Lakeland there is a flight museum called Fantasy of Flight. They use advertise it with a plane near the road positioned nose down, like it had crashed. They had to change it to just a regular landed position because the authorities were getting so many calls about a crashed plane next to the highway.
I know a guy and his walrus that can make that disappear.

Great find. Finding literally tonnes of blubber when they're trying to fatten up for hibernation is the best day ever for a bear. 
How do I know those aren't just tiny bears? 
I bet the national parks guys are hoping the bears can finish the whole thing, fuck cleaning that up.
That's a very impressive kill. Nicely done, grizzles!
Reminds me of a [Far Side](http://i.imgur.com/4DqHp.jpg) comic.
Those seagulls are freaking huge!
"Anyway, like I was sayin', whale is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey's uh, whale-kabobs, whale creole, whale gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple whale, lemon whale, coconut whale, pepper whale, whale soup, whale stew, whale salad, whale and potatoes, whale burger, whale sandwich. That- that's about it."

HOLY SHIT MORTY, A BUFFET!
The sea was angry that day, my friends. Like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. I got about fifty feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell you he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence, he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy, big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling, I realized that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing, I could see directly into the eye of the great fish. 

Mammal. 

Interesting. Though I'm a tad concerned that "banana for scale" will be replaced with "bear for scale". That could get dangerous.
Why do the seagulls look so big? 
Those bears are in heaven
Where did you get those tiny bears????????
This is the sort of things that passes through bear knowledge and slowly becomes bear myth, until eventually it's about how the Fish That Swims through the Largest Bluest River Above All was finally brought down to the Green and consumed by six warrior bears, one who was the strongest of his tribe, one the wisest, one the fastest, one the biggest, one the most cowardly, and of course the youngest one of his tribe who seemed to be nothing but a hindrance to the other ursas until he recognizes what all the other bears had missed, as only children can do.
Bears love whale tails as much as I do
Those are some small bears.

"Congratulations, we are awarding you a michelin star for your sign.  It is awesome."

Edit: Fuck off you bastards I'm trying to work. Go on, shoo.
I like these kinds of design with more than meets the eye. I remember having my mind blown when somebody first pointed out to me that then [Milwaukee Brewers logo](http://i.imgur.com/aw4OIRx.png) wasn't just a baseball glove
I'm a bit disappointed to find the restaurant doesn't exist. I found [these additional photos](http://www.logoed.co.uk/2015/09/07/the-swan-mallard/) and typed in the web address. Nothing.

This sign makes me wish I was a graphic designer.  
The S&M?
You see Uber . . . now THAT is a logo !
This seems appropriate:
http://i.imgur.com/qpFMB48.jpg
How about the Pittsburgh Zoo's [logo](http://www.kmssa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NEWS-JAN2014-PBZ-logo.jpg)?
Even if you didn't have the name spelled out underneath, you could still figure out what it was by way of deducktion.
Where's the full mallard? I only see the head.
I guaranfuckingtee you they came up with the logo first, then the name.
Is it a gay swan?
I mean its cool... I don't know if its 9000 upvotes cool... 
I dont see the duck...
Makes me think of Super Hans. 
I see the swan but not the mallard... help?

edit: Ok I got it. Look at the orange thing in the center of the white "loop", thats the Mallards mouth + nostrils facing TOWARDS you. then the little spaces in the bottom are its feet

The swan is facing left, the mallard is facing towards the camera basically.
I'm going to disagree with the majority here. It's a wonderful concept but the execution is a little unrefined. The type face of the logo and the restaurant are not the same so it feels disconnected. I think if the designer had instead focused on drawing the animals to create the ampersand, rather than squeezing them in to the sans serif ampersand, it would have better reflected the elegance of the type face in *The Swan & Mallard*.  There's greater potential here.

My dog jumped headfirst into what can only be described as a mud pit once, she was covered from her nose to the end of her rib cage. My. White. Dog. I *screamed* when I saw her and it was half an hour of scrubbing her clean. She was delighted the whole time.
Can we get a happy pic to soothe our aching hearts?

Walk of shame
This reminds me of my old 'triever, Ben. Like most of 'em he loved water, even when he was reeeally old.

We went to house sit for some friends in Dorset (UK) when he was about 12 and cracking on a bit (actually lasted till 16 bless him). One day I took him and my much younger german shepherd Sadie for a walk, and we came across this sort of drainage ditch/ stream that was about as deep as I am tall and about the same distance across, so pretty deep and steep. Ben smells the water and, with a speed I didn't realise he was still capable of, decides to clamber down to it. He sank up to his belly in mud. I went in after him and tried to haul him out but the sides were too high - the best I could do was hold him in my arms against the side of the ditch so he didn't sink any deeper. We were good and stuck.

The antics of my frantic younger dog and my panicked shouts eventually attracted the attention of another dog walker, and I begged her to go back to where we were staying, about half a mile away, and get my mum. She headed off after tying Sadie to the bridge over the ditch for me.

I waited for what seemed like hours, probably about half an hour, up to my calves in pretty cold mud, covered in more mud and a copious amount of hair, holding an exhausted dog. I was wearing a sundress, so my arms and legs were covered in scratches as well. 

Suddenly, firemen! My mum had called them after hearing the description of the ditch. I have never been so happy to see firemen. In minutes they had placed Ben into a large tarp and hauled him out of there and pulled me out. Mum and Ben got a lift back in the fire engine but they couldn't fit me and Sadie, and I was pretty much a mud person by then. I didn't want to ruin my shoes so I ended up walking back barefoot with a frantic germen shepherd stepping all over my feet on a gravel road with no pavement.

By the time I got back my mum had made the firemen (must have been about 8 of them at least) cups of tea. She then got the hose out to start hosing Ben down and the bastard started running around the garden to get away from the water with all the energy of a dog half his age.

The firemen did offer to pressure hose me but I declined.

**TLDR - elderly dog tried to swim in a 6ft deep, steep sided ditch full of mud, I got stuck trying to get him out, got covered in mud, hot firemen rescued me looking like a cavewoman, dog regained enough energy to run away from the hosepipe afterwards.**
How hard did you laugh?

[Story](http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/08/crowd-protests-water-contamination-flint-city-hall/78517054/)

>Flint's drinking water became contaminated with lead in 2014 after its supply source was switched from Lake Huron water provided by what was then the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the more polluted and corrosive Flint River.

>The cost-cutting move resulted in a spike in lead levels in children. A recent preliminary report from a task force appointed by Snyder placed most of the blame on the state Department of Environmental Quality and prompted the Dec. 29 resignation of DEQ Director Dan Wyant.

>Although the state assisted the city in moving its source of drinking water back to Lake Huron water supplied by Detroit in October, concerns about contamination remain because the river water damaged pipes and other infrastructure. A state health official told Flint residents on Thursday to either drink bottled water or use a filter that can remove lead. She also urged residents with children younger than 6 to immediately have their kids tested to determine the level of lead in their blood.


Politics and finger pointing aside, if you need bottled water, the #FlintWaterProject will be handing it out tomorrow at 1PM at the Enterprise Rent-A-Car on Pierson Rd. in Flint. More details at http://flintwaterproject.weebly.com/

We are a grassroots effort of local business owners and university students in the area working together to accumulate and distribute bottled water on a biweekly basis. 

If you need access to filtration devices, the 1st battalion, 125th infantry regiment is the Michigan Army National Guard unit that has been activated to help. They are headquartered right in Flint on S. Chavez Drive off of 475. They're in that old creepy castle building you've probably driven past 1000 times. Give them a call at (810) 235-8701.
I am from the Flint area and only recently moved away. A large portion of my family still lives in the area and a few of those live in the affected area. From what I've gathered from them, the National Guard is now in the area distributing bottled water. Locals are illegally posing as National Guardsmen and are selling water filters to people. One of my family members administers medical clinics in and around the Flint area and has told me that one of the patients just recently died allegedly from the water. There have been 10 deaths so far that are supposedly related to the Flint water. In addition to that, many children in the affected area are now developmentally challenged due to the water. There are a multitude of other health related side effects that people are facing and will likely face the duration of their lives. No, this is NOT getting the attention it needs. This issue has been a known issue for multiple years and just recently (with lots of opposition from responsible parties) has the issue started to come to light. Flint isn't the most respectable place in the world, but people do not deserve to be treated like this.
I'm from Michigan and I don't think this is getting enough attention. I barely hear about this even though it's affecting thousands of locals


Looks like a truck drivers piss bottle.
Is Flint Michigan run by Lex Luthor?
[deleted]
A national embarrassment. This is some third-world bull crap.  
The river water they're pumping is leaching iron from the mains, hence the ugly color.

The thing is that kids are significantly affected by this. Their are long term affects associated with lead poisoning to developing children. 
Holy shit.  I saw something about this on a friends Facebook feed last night and completely dismissed it (he's one of those Chem trails guys).  That is insane!  How is that not a crime against humanity?
I mean, what are they gonna do if you don't pay for your poison water?  Cut off the access to your poison water?
That looks like piss.
I heard about this on NPR last night. It's so sad. All these kids have been contaminated with lead and they will most likely be mentally underdeveloped and lead even has ties to criminality as well. The government condemned so many people. 
Ahh, "Pure Michigan".
I met a home health care nurse at a protest in Flint last Friday.  Imagine being unable to leave your home, on a fixed income, and can't use the water in your home. There is also a legionnaires outbreak in Flint too.  
Also, thousands of people still don't have water in Detroit, another place taken over by Snyder's Emergency Managers.  I live in a Detroit suburb and I might bitch about my water bill going up because of what's going on in Detroit but at least I still have clean water available to me. 
So, if you're in Michigan and you live in Flint or Detroit . . . you're screwed.  The only reason Lansing has recovered from autoplants closing and the recession is because of their mayor Virg Benero, who I might add lost to Snyder in the race for Governor.  
  
http://abcnews.go.com/Health/health-officials-investigate-legionnaires-outbreak-flint-michigan-linked/story?id=36294088

The infrastructure of this country needs some improvement.  In 2013 the American Society of Civil Engineering said that they would need 3.6 trillion by 2020 to get things back up to an acceptable level.  But no one thinks of infrastructure until its broken.  Can't fix that bridge until it collapses.  Can't replace the lead pipes till everyone has lead poisoning.

Politicians can't tell you they want to spend all your tax money on things you can't see under the street, because they never will be elected if they do.  If you care about living in a 1st world country then make sure your candidates support fixing the stuff you rely on instead of just giving out tax cuts.
That cannot be water. It looks like piss!

This is terrible.
I go to MSU and my engineering professor used this as just one example of why we, as engineers, can't fuck up.
The title makes it seem like the protest is about past-due bills being sent out, sure that is shitty... but the real protest is because of the lead water itself.  

Invest in water.  When politicians are bought by the companies, allow crap water to go through pipes, bottled water will be the way to go.  Americans will not protest long enough for nationwide change to happen.  Invest in water.
Damn. I figured he was probably exagerating, maybe put some dirt in the water to make it look worse, but thats [actually what it looks like coming straight out of the tap](http://media.fyre.co/8MmBwEQbQdeZCQ8MWoSw_FlintWaterUgh.jpg)
But *sure*, let's get rid of the EPA.

Edit: Yes, there are many who want to get rid of it. During the last debate, Rubio called it the, "Employment Prevention Agency"
Shit like this is why I'm a political moderate.  I understand the mistrust of government.  We're supposed to trust our drinking water.  Remember?  Buying bottled water is silly and a waste of money?  On the private market side you see Nestle saying that water isn't a human right.

We're fucked...
The crazy thing I wish more people were talking about with this story is the Emergency Manager law that allowed Snyder to take over Flint and make this water decision in the first place was actually voted on and repealed by us Michiganders. But shortly after the fact Snyder signed signed new Emergency Manager legislation that couldn't be repealed...

And this is done all over America, just so you can have this feeling in the deserts, mountains, forests, grasslands, etc. It's no coincidence - others came before you and felt that way and made it their mission to protect these lands. 

I've always thought that one of America's greatest assets is its natural beauty, and I'm so thankful that there were folks with the foresight to protect it. Get out there and enjoy America's National Parks, Wilderness Areas, and National Forests!

Well, fuck. What's Cali complaining about? I can see shit loads of water.
[This is from a trip I made a few months ago, here's a link to more if anyone's interested.](http://imgur.com/a/08QJN)
In Oregon, the entire coastline is public. You cannot buy it. 
California has many robust laws governing development, particularly in coastal areas.  Laws like the California Coastal Act prohibit restricting public access to beaches and make all development on the coast subject to government review.  The California Environmental Quality Act gives *anyone* legal standing in court to litigate against a permitting agency (City, County, etc.) if the agency has not fully disclosed, evaluated, and mitigated for environmental impacts resulting from a development.  CEQA especially is used by environmental activist groups to prevent development in pristine habitats.  It's not a 100% effective method to prevent development, however.  Usually the goal is to delay the project so long that the developer runs out of money or the investment loses its profitability and they give up.

A great example of a beautiful place in California that was slated for luxury development is the [Gaviota Coast](http://www.sblandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Gaviota-Morning-Tajiguas.jpg) near Santa Barbara.  The development proposed on that land was litigated for decades before the developer went bankrupt.
that's definitely big sur.
I'm a land use planner who, with my colleagues, manages the Local Coastal Program for a northern California county. The majority of my day is spent getting yelled at by landowners who don't understand why they can't develop their land however they would like. Thanks for appreciating the reason I get yelled at all the time! 
Speaking of protected coast, I just took a canoe ride down the Russian River here in CA. There were tons of spots on the shore that said "Private shore, no stopping here." Is there no protection for river access? That seems crazy to me.
For those of us who want to preserve wild space in the Bay Area, check out [Peninsula Open Space Trust](http://www.openspacetrust.org). They use donations to buy up land and create parks and other protected open space. 

They help keep my weekends looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gm9pKRp.jpg). 


The people who protect California's coast from development already live on the coast.

It's too bad Florida didn't have the same good sense. I haven't been to the Gulf side or every nook and cranny of the Atlantic side, but as far as I could tell they never saw a shoreline they didn't want to obscure with a hotel.

Only decent beach I saw was on federally protected land.
I love the PCH
Wasn't the Govenator really big on protecting this?
If you really want to be amazed, find the documentary 'Rebels with a Cause.'  Fascinating story of the group that was the seed of CA coastline conservation in the Nixon era.
"http://rebelsdocumentary.org/the-film/synopsis/
Yep, its a pretty impressive place is Big Sur. The US National Park system is honestly one of the wonders of the modern world. When you look at places like the South East coast of China for example (which would be beautiful if not for all the cities and pollution) it really does stand out. 
As a Native Californian born and raised in the Central Coast, Im right there with ya bud
Recently did that CA-1 drive and it was fucking great. Stopped several times just to take in the beauty, saw some whales off the coast, hiked around several of the parks. What a fantastic part of our state.
West coast is the best coast!
That's a really lovely, really appropriate, and really rare thing to say. There are, indeed, thousands of private citizens and office holders who have fought tooth and nail to keep the coast unspoiled by those with the money and connections and desire to spoil it for all time for their own personal, ephemeral gain.
Blue you sit so pretty. West of the one.
I'm going up the coast with my friends tomorrow morning for a camping trip. The redwoods are the most amazing part of NorCal :)
Absolutely beautiful! Need to make a trip across the US and hike these views! Thanks OP!

"Paramount pictures"
I few out of Seattle a few years ago and the pilot announced Rainier's visibility over the PA.  He proceeded to seriously bank the plane (felt like 30-35 degrees!) to give everyone a good view since we were flying more close to directly over the top.

That's the most I've ever felt a commercial flight banked to one side.  My face was smashed against the window and people were holding on to the armrests to not smash the people next to them.

I thought it was beautiful that someone that flies 100+ hours a month and has probably seen 100% of the country from 30,000+ feet countless times still acknowledges the beauty and shared it with everyone.  I wish I had been able to thank him after the flight.
Awesome!  Right place, right time!  
How did you keep the picture so crisp through glass? Serious question from an aspiring photographer that struggles with windows
God I fucking love this state.
Nice picture!

I just climbed Rainier in August, so this was fun to see!

Rainier is absolutely spectacular.  I mean, sure, someday it's going to kill us all, but in the meantime, it's gorgeous :D
Beautiful shot. This phenomenon has a name: [Alpenglow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpenglow).
Pacific Northwest mountains are the best mountains.  All of them, from Rainier to Hood to St Helens to Jefferson to Baker to Adams to Crater Lake, they all have such awesomely beautiful landscapes.
Please x-post this to /r/unitedstatesofamerica and /r/EarthPorn OP.  This is a wicked cool shot.  
When I tried to take pictures on the airplane, the windows are always dirty or fogged up, smh. 
How did you ever find an airplane window that wasn't foggy, scratched, and scuffed?
Thats one clean window...
Wow, one of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen. Well done
For anybody wondering about those lenticular clouds
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_cloud
During my cross country (MD to WA) road trip this summer, one of the most stunning things I saw was Mt. Rainier on the horizon. As far away as the Columbia River, I saw it, and just said "Holy shit that's a big fucking mountain." For the most of the trip, all the way to Seattle, we saw it on the horizon. 
I've been on many airplanes and I have never seen a window clean and clear enough to get a good picture out of. Must've been brand new...
What planes are you people on that have these crystal clear windows? I'm always stuck looking out ones that appear to have been smeared with a thin layer of mayonnaise.

This exact same thing is happening at my place except it's mushrooms and on the inside of my apartment. 
Good way to create a "green wall"; really bad for the structural integrity of a dry-stone wall, though. Everything is a trade-off. 
Is the water not from the pipe hanging off the gutter in the top right?
Life finds a wall.

That doesn't look like an approved outlet, that looks like an indoor splitter plugged in outside. 
Life, uh, finds a way
If years of playing video games has taught me anything, there's something behind that wall. 
Moisture is the essence of wetness, and wetness is the essence, of beauty.
Same problem /fun. Ours is located by the front door, and drips all over our front walk. Bought $4 worth of pvc piping to run it into our flowers, and now we have cute frogs everywhere. 
I would imagine that the inside of that wall is alive, too, with black mold and a thriving carpenter ant colony.
I too enjoy black mold in my abode.  
The white and black coloring in the upper right looks like a scary face.
It looks like a part of the wall from the movie The Labyrinth!  Is there a talking worm too??
I'm really lichen this one.
No shit, a friend of mine used to toss his weed seeds out the window next to his AC unit....those plants grew fat son

This is a sculpted rocking chair made in the fashion of famous furniture designer Sam Maloof, but with modifications to the design.
This modified version is designed and made by Hal Taylor (@HalTaylor_Rocks on IG).  
If you visit Hal's web page, this chair actually holds a very special and highly hypocritical back story.  You see, one of Hal's former apprentices once asked if he could use this design to make for himself, to which Hal said "fuck no".  The apprentice made one anyway and Hal was all "argggghhhhh".  Then Hal went on making reproduction Sam Maloof chairs for a living, just as he had before.
Edit:  Hal's web address.  http://www.haltaylor.com The store I'm referring to is at the bottom of the home page.  I'm not really trying to shit talk him, as Hal Taylor is easily one of the best chair makers in the country of this fashion (Maloof reproductions).  But if you build near reproductions for a living I think things can get a little funny.
Butthole Edit:  Spelling.  I wrote this on mobile laying in bed after a hard days work and about to take a nap.  
OK...where do we get one?
Sam Maloof chair. 
Is that Donald Rumsfeld?
Also a great stripper chair.
I don't know why but this chair feels creepy to me. I am not in favor. Idea: good. Execution: weird. 
I guess I could put my laptop on one side and my beer on the other.
And for a single gamer its a great gaming chair. Cheetos on one side Mt. Dew on the other.
This would be great if I didn't have a couch.
That chair has a very short window of usefulness.
Gimmicky
Craftsmen are a dying breed and Craftsmanship is almost a pipe dream nowadays.


We call this the Jared Fogle chair 
$50 we find someone in the bible belt using one because they liked how it had edges to rest and air out your fat rolls on.

Having been through that (3 kids 25 months apart from start to finish), that is awesome!
This is so awesome, people don't do enough storytelling.

There is actually some context to this picture that means it makes a little more sense. I can tell from his picture and the car number plate that it's taken in the state of New South Wales, Australia. This months new laws came in requiring drivers to give cyclist at least 1 metre space in 60km/hr zone and 1.5m in higher speed zones. So while it's still stupid to put this sign in the bike lane, it's there to remind people of the new laws.

That looks cool as hell. I can't imagine how long it took to make.
Massive find. If the date holds up, it was around this time [Christianity was officially recognized by the Roman Empire ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire) .
  
   
Of even more importance, to this find especially is that in 330 CE Constantine moves the traditional capital of Rome to Constantinople, which geographically is very close to where this find is. It is also considered by historians the beginning of the Byzantine Empire. 
Well, shit. Now we gotta rework all the plans because we can't lay the sewer here.
I saw a bunch of these in Caesarea. They are absolutely beautiful and were in wonderful shape, despite being exposed to the elements.

[Here is a photo I took back in November.](http://i.imgur.com/jc12rNi.jpg)

Why the hell are these things covered in the first place?   At some point, this insanely expensive, intricate piece of work is just looked at and a dude says "Welp, lets cover it with dirt.  I need to build a mud hut"?  

Seriously, what the hell? 

Man we never find the good Roman stuff in America :(
It's crazy how much is buried underneath us. 
I still find it mind boggling when I see the beautiful works of art and tremendous architecture and just overall grand scale of the Roman empire, and then just see how far society can regress at its collapse where great bath houses with clean running water through aqueduct systems are replaced by people throwing buckets of refuse and feces out the window on the ground below.   Can you imagine growing up as a child in the dark-ages, and seeing all these ruins that no one can reproduce? 
Amazing and a  wonderful Saturnalia present! 
Why is that semicolon there?
Is that a bull and a bear fighting? When are the romans taking over so we get that kind of tv
I bet getting anything built in that city is such a pain in the ass. Oh we're just gonna dig a few feet Aaaand priceless ancient treasures everywhere. 
1,700 years earlier: "Kids, I got us a new jigsaw puzzle!"
Recently discovered ... [in 1996](http://www.lodmosaic.org/home.html) ... during highway construction. 


EDIT: Found in Lod, Israel. Believed to be from 300 A.D. Preserved and then removed from the ground in 2009. Aprox. 50 x 27 feet. Went on a multiple museum tour, including the Met, Field Museum, Louvre, the Altes, beginning in 2010. 
Is that a mr.clean magic eraser? 
What are they going to do next?  
Is it going to be left there as a historical site? Or would it be moved somewhere like a museum? 
Just think of everything that has happened in human history in the past 1,700 years. The Crusades. The Renaissance. The rise of Hitler/Nazis. That video of Ray J slamming Kim K. The French Revolution. This mosaic has been through all of that. It's just insane to think about
Nice; semicolon; you have; there.
**FISH:** Oh thank god! I've been buried for 1,700 years! Wait, I'm a fish. I can't breathe air. I'm dying!

*This is just my personal interpretation, I am not an archaeologist.

Stuff like this is honestly so cool. 

Just imagine how much other unknown history is buried beneath the surface. Crazy to think that in 2015 almost 2016, we're still discovering things here on earth. And in space. Literally, what a time to be alive. 
Hopefully this will get preserved somehow. Generally with construction projects and historical artifacts it's, "You have a few days to catalog this and get what you can then we're continuing work and whatever will be destroyed."

On the Autobahn it's actually pronounced Aluminium
I bet it smelt terrible.
It's a whole bunch of T-1000's
This has happened in the US at least several times.  The link is to one in Michigan in 1986 and I know of one about 1977 that was also a fatal accident.  In the 1977 instance, someone tried to drive around the turned over truck through the spill metal.  Bad idea.

If anyone is interested in the technical specs, this was shot with a Canon 5D Mk III at 1/4000/sec, f 5.6, using a Canon 100-400 zoom lens. Composited (obviously) in Photoshop, approximately 70 layers, with a final file size of 3600 px x 11,000 px. Also, these are Ruby-throated hummingbirds, mostly females and juveniles, shot in my backyard in New York State.

I've always wanted a hummingbird. I wanna feed it sugar water and watch game of thrones with it.
But when I do that in the women's bathroom suddenly I'm the bad guy.
You could have gotten this done at [my place in 10 minutes](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WUi-UoMRFnk). 

Beautiful!
That's enough to make an Air Traffic Controller twitch.
That would make a great background.
They must be one of the most memorizing sights.

I have a feeder outside my home-office, and its dominated by a single Hummingbird, and "sometimes" allows others nearby to feed from it.

Best work distraction since Reddit...
Amazing job. Finally a good post. Quality and genius. 
Such cool birds. They're so fast and mechanical in their movements, like little flying robots. 
PROTIP: Throw a pack of red bee balm seeds in a corner of your yard by your windows. They absolutely go apeshit for red bee balm. We've been enjoying them for the last 3 summers in a row, as bee balm is a perennial.

Zero maintenance.
Very cool pic. I love the stitched time lapse type of photos.

However, I am now irrationally afraid of being ventilated by tiny bug-birds.
Hummingbirds mostly look at our feeder and then fly away. I realized tonight it's at least partly because we look intently at them whenever they come by. What can we do for more hummingbird action?!
That's a beautiful image.
It reminds me of the work of Mike Kelley.

Front page material right here, and I don't have a witty comment. 
I've watched hummingbirds feed before. The pic leaves out the hundreds of bird shit squirts.

But it is a very cool pic.

I would love to see your other shots, can you link your portfolio?
Not pictured: The hundreds of hummingbird fights around the feeder, because hummingbirds are territorial assholes who will throw down if another one even looks at their feeder.
That's an awesome idea! Never thought of that.  
This might be a stupid question. But why did you need to shot off a mirror reflection? Why couldn't you just shoot the birds straight on?
Holy shit that's awesome. How is that taken? Time lapse?

He was hanging out the whole time because he knew the light wasn't right yet.
I am very glad to see that everyone likes this picture, so I should add a little context in a single post.

This was taken in Etosha National Park, Namibia [edit: detailed location removed, see comments below]. I waited at a waterhole for 7 hours from noon to 7pm. There was very little wildlife activity during the afteroon, and only a few springboks showed up to drink. At around 6pm the sky was still overcast and I almost decided to leave, but eventually decided to stay until the end of the day. The real show started around 6:30pm as the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.

I went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.

I travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience. Go if you ever get the chance!

Finally I have a [photography website](http://www.johangeorget.com) for those who wish to see pictures of this trip. I hope no one will mind me that I share the links here.

Edit: many people have asked if I sell prints. I do, but it will only be possible through my website in a couple of days. Reply to this post here, send me a PM or an email, and I'll contact you back with the details very shortly.

Edit 2 [20/05/2015]: it is now possible to buy prints of the picture [here](http://www.johangeorget.com/Prints/Prints/). I will also be donating 50% of print sales to [Save The Rhino](https://www.savetherhino.org).

Crazy beautiful! Is this professional or a hobby?
I have a feeling that, before I die, these guys will be extinct. And that's unfortunate because they are my favorite animal.
this is the only acceptable way to shoot a rhino
Nice black rhino, it reminds me of the secret rhino gatherings that were filmed where they all congregate at midnight and have a little social time, great footage if you can find it. Looks like Halali in Etosha?

Here's their post from yesterday when they found it: https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61#.1va7bxyjx
Hey! That's me in the pic! Check out www.operationthonapa.com for the whole story. Great fun and a crazy trip....never actually thought we would find what we were after 
Can you imagine spending so much time and energy on this, and then seeing it on the ground and picking it up. Probably a very surreal moment 
I've been following their [blogging](https://operationthonapa.com/) as they have found different items from the plane, human remains, etc. This is an amazing story to watch unfold and my hat's off to these awesome two dudes. Talk about having a goal and getting it done.

More info on the crash: 
[Eastern Airlines Flight 980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980)
Dan Futrell and I (Isaac Stoner) got lost down a rabbit hole on on Wikipedia looking up unrecovered black boxes. Took some serious effort but now there's a smashed up flight recorder on my kitchen counter!  
That's the orange box. They need to keep looking.
Actually, they found pieces of the casing of the flight recorders, and some loose magnetic tape which, [as they themselves say on their blog](https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61), may be nothing more than tape from a passenger's home video.

It's far too early to say they've found anything substantive, regardless of how amazing it is that they've managed to find anything at all.
I just got to the part of the blog where they talk about finding crocodile skins all over the debris field, and basically accusing Eastern Airlines of taking part in a crocodile skin smuggling ring. Interesting...maybe they'll end up uncovering more than they bargained for, which is like the beginning of every horror/thriller movie.
Why didn't any of the various airplane crash investigative agencies do this?

edit: answered my own question, sort of:  The NTSB did send people but "because the wreckage was spread over a vast area and covered by 6 to 9 meters of snow, it was not possible for him and his fellow team members to locate either of the "black boxes.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980#On-site_investigation
I set small goals like not losing a sock in the laundry and I can't even accomplish that.
I had read their blog as they were doing this. The part where they were finding the human remains and burying them... super powerful stuff man. I teared up a little reading that. Congrats on finding the recorder!
That's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Or a small box in the Andes...
Holy shit this is awesome. It makes me want to find another plane crash that has missing black boxes and go find one myself... Talk about bucket list shit.
I bet it was the last place they looked.
This will be an over dramatized movie, I guarantee it. 
"dood we fahkin found the blahk bawx bro"
Notice the subtle middle finger in the picture.
I feel like they could have found this faster by crashing another plane into the mountain and watching where everything fell.
Send these dudes after 370. 
Was anyone else thinking of the flight that crashed into the Andes mountains in 1972 and everyone had to resort to cannibalism? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptyi89sNPq4
So they make the black box orange so that you can find it easily.  They should make them the color of his jacket.

geologist here.  that's not marble. but it is cool!
When I was in the third grade our class went on a feild trip to a rock quarry to search for fossils, most people found small ones and partial trilobite imprints. I was off on my own with a straight claw hammer my dad gave to me to break apart rocks to search for fossils, I break a part a rock with noticeable separate layers and boom a full trilobite fossil about two inches long. I am super excited and ran it over to my teacher, she said "oh  wow, I've never seen one this good outside of a museum, let me hold on to it for you so nothing happens to it". So I go back to searching and don't find any thing else. So we get back to school and I ask for it back and she says "no I'm keeping for the class to see, it's going on display". I instantly start to cry and she sends me back to my desk. I get home that afternoon still upset so my dad asks me what is wrong and I go through the story, "get in the truck now". We drive back to school and she still refuses to give it up, we get the principal involved and he only promised to put my name on a plaque on the display. She retired a few years ago I bet she still has it.
For some strange reason I find this picture distressing for some reason. I'm going to have nightmares about this piece of marble now, I'm sure of it. 
This is the itchiest thing I've seen all week.
I want my counters to be made out of this.
Praise helix!
That looks cool... and somewhat disgusting.
Holy trypophobia Batman.
Ahh, I see you chose the helix fossil 
Referred to as ["Marston Magna Marble"](https://www.fossilera.com/fossils/polished-ammonite-fossils-marston-magna-marble), having been 'quarried from near Marston Magna, Somerset'
that triggered some very uncomfortable shit  
Limestone matrix, not a true marble despite the name of the stone.

Fossils really don't survive the metamorphic process by which one gets marble from limestone. 
this makes me uncomfortable.
PRAISE THE HELIX 
PRAISE LORD HELIX!!
Damn that rock killed a whole family. 
Probably shelled out a lot of money for that.

I'm very late to the thread (because, well, I live in Moscow and it's at least 7 hours later from most of you), but I see a lot of questions about the city and would be willing to answer any when I wake up for work tomorrow! I'm an American who's lived and worked here for about a year and am continually surprised by the misconceptions about Russia I see on Reddit.

My first reaction was "Oh god why would you open your eyes in the bubbles"
I'm trying to imagine what could possibly be the reason for wanting to take a picture of a sink draining.
It's been said before, but /r/mildlyinteresting is quietly one of the most interesting subreddits.
At least 23 budding musicians just bookmarked this image for their next album cover. 
There was a section in Slavoj Zizek's movie "The Pervert's Guide to Cinema" where he describes the point where an object returns your gaze back to you.  

Gaze is an important topic in Lacanian psychology and elsewhere: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze

Jacques Lacan the Gaze FIlm Theory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvgX_FncwvM

Also, this reminds me of the last part of the shower scene in Hitchcock's Psycho where the camera pans from her blood flowing into the shower drain, and then dissolves into a close-up of her eye.  From there it pans back and you see her dead with her face pressed up against the floor.

This actually gave me chills. Absolutely beautiful.
I know that all Olympians work hard to get there, but Paralympians are fucking badass.
What a powerful message on just one image.
Note: "Paralympics" derives from "Parallel Olympics," not "Paralyzed Olympics." 
This poster does such a good job at making a handicap seem badass that I almost want to cut my own leg off. Well done, well done indeed. It's hard to promote something like this without evoking pity, and they did it. 
Am I the only one who thinks paralympics is much more enjoyable to watch than normal olympics?

Just look at this list of sports they have in paralympics:

* wheelchair basketball
* wheelchair tennis
* wheelchair rugby
* 100m running, for amputees
* swimming
* etc.

I watch paralympics and end up being more impressed of them than the 'normal' participants. Major respect to the participants :)

Why isn't all advertising this good?  It's nice to see advertizing I want to share with other people.
Very well done!
This is wicked, really gives a different perspective to the paralympics games. Really well done!
I've honestly never stopped and thought about what being a paralympian entailed before. It's incredible that a single image can completely put everything in perspective.
One day the Paralympics will out preform the all-human Olympics.

If you like this pic, I *highly* recommend you watch the film [Samsara (2011)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770802/) on Blu-ray or some HD source. When I first saw the footage of this region, Bagan, featured in that film, I was actually in disbelief for a moment, questioning whether the footage was real, and trying to absorb the idea that this was in fact an actual place on Earth. 
Edit: spelling


And if you like Samara, it's predecessor [Baraka] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103767/) is even better, IMO.
You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me.
PINOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOIR.

**Photo Details:**

This photo is a 26.6 MP photo  merged from two 24 MP shots from a Sony a7 camera. I had a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.4 manual focus lens (with a B+W filter for protection) attached. The two shots were merged using Lightroom's built in photomerge (which results in a single raw pano). Not much was done in Lightroom other than exposure changes, color changes and some healing brush to remove lens flare.

This photo was taken after I shot a 3 hour timelapse of the sunrise. I was just about leave, when I decided to actually take a few photos.

Your modesty is even more mind blowing.
Was there in August, didn't see a single ballon in 3 days. Off-season, I guess :)
I would comment, but my mind is blown.
I'm Burmese, live near there (Bagan, Mandalay Region). :)
Fun fact: there used to be farms with people living in them in the fields near those temples, but everyone was forcefully relocated by the military to turn the area into a tourist region! Yaayyyyyy
Do you have a higher quality version?  I wanted to use it as a wallpaper, but it looks like Imgur compressed the shit out of it.  You can use a straight up file hosting service like Dropbox or Google Drive to host the image instead of an image hosting service like Imgur.
At first I thought those were buffalo or a similar type of animal. Then I saw the buildings and thought they were teeny tiny buildings. 

Those are not buffalo, those are trees. I need to go to bed.
*ELAINE! I'M IN BURMA!*
bagan is awesome.
thanks for the new wallpaper
That's... absolutely breathtaking.

I made a super-wide version and played around with the contrast and color balance a tiny bit (I don't want to take any focus off the original photo, I just thought super-wide looked cool too):

How do we know its actually her pet and not just some sloth she picked up?
Fun fact about several Amazonian tribes; they almost never hunt/eat sloths because they are believe to be the spirits of old people manifested as them.

I believe she's from the Yagua Indian tribe in Yanamoto (in the Peruvian Amazon)

A Google search turns up a lot of similar images on travel blogs, so it seems common at least in this village to have tamed sloths around.

The paint on her face and her eyes remind me of Princess Mononoke

Maybe sloth's used to be cats that ancient people did everything for, turning them into the slow moving, docile creatures we see today.
Well shit.  Why the fuck did I get a cat when this is an option.
BELT!
The Wonder Woman movie is gonna be WEIRD.
I saw something like this in BBC's *Human Planet* (on Netflix). It's a community that raises animal from the Amazon as pets. Like when a mother monkey is hunted, her kin is taken in. Once they become pets, they are no longer edible.

This is gorgeous! Where was it shot?
Location needs to be mandatory on these types of pics.
To think, generations ago someone layed those stones individually and we are now appreciating their efforts so many years in the future. Gives me a really good feeling.
Reminds me of skyrim
Gimme 3 minutes and I can turn my ankle on that super hard.
Reminds me of the witcher 3, probably because I've never left Florida.
Reminds me of the day March 5, 2016.
Anyone got a high resolution version?
I wonder at the effort it took to make this path. Who were the people that laid down those stones? Were they friends or strangers or perhaps was it the down to the dedication of a single solitary soul who wanted to share this view with others? Was it done on a hot summer's day with bugs flying about their ears or perhaps over a cold misty mornings before it got too hot? Were the stones selected with care or was it done haphazard and made to work?

There is so much tied up in those stones that is lost to us. Like the breeze through the tree's. The heave and rustle of the branches announces it's but it's gone before we have time to acknowledge it.
When the trees are too lazy to find dirt to grow in so they grow on rocks
So beautiful but the tree kinda reminds me of a land octopus
Is there a wallpaper version of this picture?

I just came back from the protests and this only shows a portion of the people there. It's estimated that somewhere between 22-24.000 people showed up. 
[Better picture of the size of the protest](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2588234.1459797417!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_635/iceland-offshore-accounts.jpg)
He literally said, in an interview earlier that day, after having said he wasn't even considering resigning and the reported asked if he was worried about the protest, "Well, I doubt everyone will show up." with a smug smirk.

So, we did.
How could he not resign? If not out of shame, practicality?
Also: impromptu family reunion.  
It's an island! Where in the fuck can he hide?
Can someone explain how internal regulators didn't catch this before the Panama Papers?

It's becoming ever more likely that Iceland will elect the first pirate prime minister (after this the pirate party may even get close to 50%). European politics gets more fascinating by the day.
PM's response tomorrow: "I have ordered an internal investigation of my self, and we have found that I did nothing wrong."

Edit: well whaddya know
Is this real? Good on those people for going out and demanding action.

What did the prime minister do?
The people of iceland have their shit together. They don't get pushed around by politicians and bankers. 

This should happen everywhere. 

Edit: Yes I know iceland isn't a very highly populated country. Which makes it's an easier thing to do.

Edit 2: Not saying that no other country has their stuff together and so on. Just praising iceland.
For historical context, I recommend the Icelandic novel The Atom Station. It gives some background to the cultural attitudes of the polity of Iceland. I don't know about Iceland but we don't read it in schools in the US generally. It's a great read.
I'm jealous that they live in a such a politically-active society. Which is the opposite of what I thought, you'd think the cold would make people sluggish and wanting to spend more time under the covers.
That's not all of Iceland. I mean, Michael isn't there.
I really hope people around the world yell and holler at this secretive hoarding of wealth by the rich. Only the illegal stuff of course. If it is legal then enjoy the game but if us peons are suffering for your shady deals then learn to watch your ass.

This great plan is about six inches of water away from becoming a bad plan.
That dip bottle really tops this photo off.
Props to whoever built that roof. That is some serious structural support.
Having the washer and drier up there is pretty impressive. 
This may be the most Texas picture I've ever seen.
WEEELLLLL it's floodin' down in Texaaassss.... 
Never change, East Texas.
"Sir, when did you realize it was time to move to the roof?"

"I been here the whole time"
I have so many questions.

How did you get a washer and dryer on the roof?

How did you have the time to get all that stuff up there?

Copenhagen or Skoal?
Is that you Stevie Ray?
What if it rains? 
Lol there's an American flag or something in his Tupperware tote.  This would be a great find the object picture game.

This is right down the road from me. Pretty crazy stuff going on down here right now.
I thought Texas was a backwards joke until I lived there. TX is likely the 2nd most free place on earth. Don't like it? Vote against it. Done deal. People give you room to be yourself...life has dignity you won't find most places and everyone helps another Texan. 
Yes, but most roofs aren't rated for any significant live loading. In Texas they probably  don't even plan for a snow load.  It may end all submerged anyway. 
Are all the telephone lines down?
Hopefully no alligators when he sleeps.

This man doesn't have the word victim in his vocabulary, I'm sure he's also missing a lot of other words as well 
Well at least he has his ps4.

Edit: special edition darth vader one too.
It's more like he saved his big ticket items, TV, furniture, electronics.  If you had no other option of saving them, it's worth a last ditch shot.  I also imagine every motel and hotel within 150 miles is full.  So what do you do when you have nowhere to go, and all your stuff is on the roof?  Live on the roof of course.  Someone has to stick around and guard the stuff anyway.
Are we positive this isn't Stevie Ray Vaughan?

I bet the photographer got a ton of points from Professor Oak for that pic.
My mom is obsessed with this animal. It's her profile picture on every social media platform. She makes me call her Pika sometimes and calls me Pika as well. It's confusing.

Edit: [yup](http://i.imgur.com/Hqi7vcb.jpg)
I just read about this thing. It's more endangered than the panda. The Chinese call it a Magic Rabbit.
>Native to the Xinjiang region of China, there are only 1,000 of these tiny, cute creatures, known as the Ili pika, left.

>Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat further up the mountain peaks.
The name of it comes from the name of area where it's found, Ili Prefecture (which is actually a shortened version). 

There's so little information because of how elusive it is so we can't currently determine causes of its endangerment. The area is somewhat mountainous as you can see in the picture, perhaps they just fall off and die or some shit.

For those interested, here is the backside of our house, which also was redone since we got the house: http://i.imgur.com/umI99yS.jpg 
If he likes beer, send him out to Arizona to build an addition to my new house.

I can pay him in beer.
Did you photoshop a picture of yourself holding an old picture of the home into a different picture of the house as it is today?

Given the sun light, the shadow the home casts, that tree, and the light on your hand it looks that way.

It doesn't matter, just curious, want to make sure I am not losing my sense of spatial awareness.


Your dad is the farmer from Harvest Moon?
Wish I could make my own house. It would look so dumb!  Like Bag-end but with castle turrets poking out!
Looks great! Is it made completely out of wood? No bricks and masonry? 
I did a thing:

[My dad works for a demolition company, and it is very interesting to see how much our house has changed since we moved in!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3gqyd6/my_dad_works_for_a_demolition_company_and_it_is/)

http://i.imgur.com/8p0e2Hy.png


What about the inside. Plus bonus pics of his toolshed
here are some of the differences i can see:

* entire house addition on the right side. 
* front door relocated. 
* eavestrough added all around. 
* chimney appears to be moved further back, but that might just be perspective. 
* addional window added downstairs. 
* lighting added near the corners of the house. 
* siding is horizontal now instead of vertical. 

i wouldn't be surprised if your dad tripled the value of the house, if not more. when was the picture taken? 
Almost doesn't even look like the same house, your dad does great work!
Is the house in the back a guest host or someone else's? 
[removed]
Your house grew a new wing!
Coming from a house built by my father, after 15 years of living here, we finally got the last room of the house finished a few weeks ago.... Kinda...
Anyway, your dad did a great job on your house, looks great!
That looks extremely norwegian. Great on him for fixing up the house .
At first I was like, *why didn't you take this from the same angle*, but then I realized the entire part on the right is essentially new. That's some serious renovation work. 
Very sharp looking
I love how the additions actually fit the architectural style of the house. So many shitty additions look like shitty additions.
My uncle was only a carpenter as a hobby but his and my aunt's house is the same way.  It started out as a 1 bedroom house about as big a as a double wide trailer.  They've added 2 bedrooms, a den with a second story master bedroom above it, and a 2 car garage.  He's probably tripled the square footage.  Not to mention the couple of big storage sheds and deck he's also built in the back yard.
That's a great looking house.
I honestly really like the second window he added on the face of the house facing the camera 
You've got to be more than a carpenter to pull that off! Did he hire expertise for concrete, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or anything?
In all seriousness it would be amazing to have those kind of skills. I'm in the process of having a home built by a builder and constantly think man it must be amazing to be able to build your own home or do your own major repairs because you already have all of the tools and the skills to do it. Plus he probably know all kinds of people in the trade that can take care of other trades like electrical or plumbing.
Wow. Jeg så deg poste dette på Face. Interessant.
Sons of construction workers can relate.

My dad extended the house by one room, and the top of that room became the balcony for the 2nd floor. Built 3 toolsheds that outlasted him.

My grandpa served for the Mexican Air Force in WW2. They were called the Aguilas Aztecas, or Aztec Eagles. They were trained in the US and entered the war in 1942. My grandpa saw a lot of fighting in the Pacific.
I never really leaned about what was going on in mexico during WWII. 
To Google!
This is one of the Aztecs Eagles, a Thunderbolt used by the "Escuadron 201", at the liberation of the Philippines circa 1945 with the allied forces, [notice the airforce insignia and mexican flag tail](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/P47_Escuadron_201_mexico.jpg)
In Guadalajara Mexico there's a statue commemorating the Mexican Air Force squadron that fought in WWII  
Ahhh that Anti-Nazi. Mexican sentiment. It's good to be brown. 
I've been hesitant to share these, and the few times I did they were buried under the comments. The reason why I don't share them all is because they do not belong to me, and if the direct owners haven't shared them before, that is their decision.


There are many more pictures in the album. I've chosen a few that do not directly identify my uncle's family so as not to disturb their privacy any further. If you end up sharing these, please grant my wish by stating that they are part of a private collection and that they have been shared without permission, which is all I can do to take responsibility for it. I am concerned for breaching their trust, but I also believe that this bit of history belongs to all Mexicans and the allies they worked with. May they find some solace in this pride, specially in these times where we are deeply concerned about civil unrest.

They come from my great-uncle, who did serve in the 201st squadron. I am just a distant nephew, and my uncle's family treasures all these memories, not just as memento, but also because they, and my family (my father served with them in a special forces group) still serve to this day with a lot of pride and honor, and with this legacy in mind.


You'd be healthily skeptic to doubt me in light of all the drug trafficking, corruption and violence levels in the country, even within the military; but boy, would I be fucking damned if I let anyone slip every Mexican soldier under that umbrella.



The stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.


The reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:


Mexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.

You can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.



But just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.


It could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.


Sure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.



Let's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.


I just got patriotic for a country I am not from. I guess propoganda works.
Great post OP. On a similar note, Alot of mexican americans fought in WWII but at the time there was only "white or black" on the census. Natrually mexicans where considered white (and many still do idenfity as such).

 This is part of why i enjoyed fury because it really made effort to be accurate in what was out there.
/r/propagandaposters has tons of stuff like this.
'Muric...I mean...'Mexica?!
Notice the two mountains in the background? Those are actually volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. They are very important to Aztec mythology. Legend has it Iztaccihuatl was an Aztec princess who fell in love with Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl was sent off to war, she was falsely told by her father that her beloved had died in battle, so in turn she died of grief. When the warrior returned to find his lover dead, he laid her to rest and kneeled beside her body to mourn her death.
Here's a good write up on the 201st squadron. [Strike of the Aztec Eagles] (http://www.airartnw.com/aztec_eagles_story.htm) I picked a up a print a while back with the signatures of the few remaining pilots. 
If I were a Nazi - I'd be wondering where the rattlesnake went.  As I learned from WWE, don't turn your back on a rattlesnake.
Aaaaand.... I have a new wallpaper v
Mexico declared war on the Axis Powers in support of the Allies on May 22, 1942, following losses of oil ships in the Gulf, most notably the Potrero del Llano and the Faja de Oro, to German submarine attacks. Although most American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and Brazil were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.

Perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the Mexican military was the Escuadrón 201, also known as the Aztec Eagles. This group consisted of more than 300 volunteers, who trained in the United States to fight against Japan. It was the first Mexican military unit trained for overseas combat.

As a Venezuelan raised in the States.. when I asked my parents what South America did to help during WWII they responded:

"Made some ammo.  And danced.  Lots of dancing!"
Once while in mexico I came across an elementary school history book. The WWII section was quite interesting. The book made the point that it was a world war, and that every country was involved. Their biggest contribution was that they sent 50,000 men to US factories to support the war effort.

Despite all of the jokes I wonder about the significance of what this picture might be in the future.

"A White House official said Obama and Putin agreed in a 35-minute meeting on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Turkey on the need for a political transition in Syria, saying events in Paris had made it all the more urgent."

"Obama huddled with Putin during a working lunch and the two agreed on the need for a Syrian-led transition including U.N.-mediated talks, the White House official said."
OP's scene is visible in background of this awkward video:

I would love to be a fly on the wall in that lobby. I'm really interested to hear what they're talking about. Could be the terrorist attacks, or some other important shit that world leaders talk about. It's a potato quality image, but I like it because it's so candid. It's not in some fancy meeting room surrounded by cameras, it's in a hotel lobby where us regular folk have a chance to walk by and admire two great minds coming together to improve our world. I'm sure security is heavy, so I may be wrong if civilians are allowed to get this close. This may not be on the same level as the FDR, Churchill, Stalin pow wow, but it's still awesome to see.

Honestly, I didn't know this sort of thing happened anymore--two of the most powerful men in the world talking one-on-one. I figured it was all policy speeches hammered out by their cabinets and simply presented at the Summit.
How I imagine this went down:

Putin: " Are you going to get in my way if I decide to fuck up ISIS?"

Obama: ".....nah. Go for it"
"Do you have any fives?"

This image takes me back to the first time I did acid. I was in high school, and the rest of my family was away at some farming convention for the weekend. I was out on the back porch and placed a tab under my tongue. Based on everything I had read and heard, I had done some meditation and relaxation exercises to try and reach as calm and steady a state as possible. I kind of wanted a spiritual sort of experience.

About 45 minutes after I took it, I really started to focus on my breathing. I could feel my skin merging with the air, and everything felt very solid, and whole. Until, that is, I opened my eyes. At that point, the clouds seemed to part, and the sky split open. The sun became a giant pixelated Mario head, and tried to eat me. I ran back inside, but was lucid enough to realize I wasn't okay. I didn't want to risk making a mess of my parents house, so I went back outside and ran straight for the neighbor's house.

They were growing a bunch of egg plants out back. For some reason, I thought the egg plants looked kind of like old-timey bombs, and I felt like I had to disarm them. Of course, this meant picking them all. Their fuses were still burning though, so I did the only thing I could think of: I pissed all over them. It put out the fuses, but the neighbor's wife came running out and beat the shit out of me with a dirty pair of trousers.
So, I actually *was* under this bridge a while ago, and for people wondering, it still looks fantastic. People have respected the murals around the city that this artist has done and it really brightens up my day whenever I see one.

[Dagestan Airlines Flight 372](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan_Airlines_Flight_372)  

>The plane was flying a scheduled trip from Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow to Uytash Airport in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan.[5] Two of the aircraft's three engines failed shortly after it took off from Vnukovo Airport at 14:07 local time (11:07 UTC); the pilots reported the loss of engines when the aircraft was at a height of around 9,100 metres (29,900 ft).[1] An emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport was requested, and as the aircraft was in the process of landing, the third engine failed.[1][5] The aircraft approached runway 32R from the right at almost right angles, overflying the threshold before turning right at 500 metres (1,600 ft) to the left of the runway and crossing over the runway, flying parallel with but to the right of the runway.[6] The aircraft touched down 88 metres (289 ft) to the right of the runway centerline, and only 350 metres (1,150 ft) short of the end, about a half hour after its departure, landing in conditions of freezing rain.[1][6]  

>The landing caused the plane to sustain major damage,[7] and it was written off shortly after the incident.[8] A passenger on board the plane said that the aircraft broke into three parts after landing.[9] Later reports said that both the cockpit and vertical stabilizer had separated from the aircraft, and that the wings and undercarriage had both been damaged.[3]

(TLDR: Flight engineer turned off fuel pump before takeoff and all three engines shut down due to "fuel starvation")
I'm not concerned, I'm sure there is a dash cam video out there which offers up a perfectly reasonable explanation why it's there.  Probably cut off another plane.
Is not crashed. Is only resting.
This serves  as a warning to any other planes that might act up.

My aunt got really into the Beanie Baby craze and built up a huge collection. Whenever we went over to her house, she would let us play with them, but we had to be *absolutely sure* that we didn't rip off the tags, because "they'll be worth a lot someday!" Pretty sure they're still sitting in her basement.  
while the crowd looks on intently
That Peanut he has isn't even royal blue... what a fucktard
Wow they actually believe they are dividing up something of major value... I remember those days. I got so pumped to get a Princess Diana beanie baby. What's it worth now? Probably jack shit. Poor couple. 

Edit: Just to clarify,

"Pumped to get" entails being 12 and having one thrown at me out the window of a car by the kid who's mom owned a local toy store. He had boxes full and to be one of the people to catch one was indescribable. It felt like I just got tossed a chunk of gold. 
I'm just trying to figure out which one's gonna get $14.56 and which one's gonna get the $14.57.
This is a really beautiful photograph. It's so raw. These adults seem to have forgotten they are in a courtroom picking their pieces of their broken marriage. 

They look just like children, but all grown up. 
The gentleman challenged his ex-wife's custodial rights to their Tomagatchi when he found no less than 4 poops on the screen during his court-supervised visit.
It would be hilarious if in a few decades Beanie Babies started auctioning for hundreds of dollars each simply because so many people threw away their "worthless collectibles". And everyone(me included) that made fun of them were mad because they didn't buy them when they could.
Just wait till they get to the pokemon cards
Never thought I'd open reddit to see my aunt and uncle on the front page. It is just as embarrassing now as it was then.

Both must cringe at the sight of this now. 
Man, I know too much about Beanie babies, and it sticks in my head like a steal trap. A few years ago, a girl said to me, "my birthday is on November 6, and I said to her, you share a birthday with Pouch the Kangaroo." So, for anyone who doubts what I'm about to say, I think I have the ruinous resume for this.

This collection of Beanies is hilariously terrible. Almost none of these were ever of any value. I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, so it's clear that these two were collecting to strike it rich. They weren't collecting just to have them. I see a lot of Legs the frogs. They had a little bit of value at one point, and when Chocolate the moose retired (which you can see a couple of, it jumped in value a little as well. But they were not big money makers. It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow. Rainbow and Iggy were released with their tags switched and body parts all messed about. There were a couple releases of each before Ty got it right. That said, it's pretty clear that she knows what she's doing, and he might be a moron. In her pile in th elower left hand corner, she has a Flip the cat, and (I think though it's hard to say for sure) a Dotty the Dalmation. Those two were pretty valuable after they were retired. Probably the most valuable in this collection presuming that the Lucky the Ladybug sitting in the middle of the pile is a later generation version of the Beanie. Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time. If it's a Doodle, I'm guessing at the time, I'd grab that. If it's a Strut, I'd go for the Crunch the Shark. In the end, Crunch would have been better, but Doodle was what everyone was speculating on.
Not even Beanie Baby collectors can stand to be around Beanie Baby collectors.
Apparently putting your hand to your face and sticking your finger on your mouth was quite the fad in 1999.
I don't even care.  I'll say it.  As a kid who loved stuffed animals, these things were the shit.  There was one for just about any animal you could want.  Played with these things every day till I grew out of them.  Think they're still in a box in a closet somewhere around here.

"Beanie babies hun."

"Dammit will you let me finish?!  Or I swear to God I'm going to take my half of the Pokemon cards and leave!"
I still have all my beanie babies, hundreds of them. Parting with them in the 90s would have been absolute torture.

I sometimes get tempted to sell them, I wish they'd remained a collectable but even if I sold them for £1 each I'd get a decent chunk of cash... I think I'd actually feel guilty though, like I was selling my childhood.

Minneapolis?
Capella Tower (left) and Wells Fargo Center (right) in downtown Minneapolis. 
This is actually a very interesting natural event. The male building lights up with bioluminescence and releases his sperm into the wind, and the receptive female is absorbing it through her open windows. In about 7 months there should be a new larval building near the base of the female. Probably a 7-11.
When I was little, I used to think the top of the left tower was a stadium with the seats hanging over the edge.  Since I've never been to the top to confirm this, I shall continue to believe until proved otherwise. 
When the building on the right is fully dark the weapon is charged and ready to fire

But wheres the kid??? What does he do now?? These are the questions I wanna know!
Do others in the school realize it's a thing?
And I just realized that kid is not standing in a kitchen. 
(And yes! The microwave still does smell burnt!)
RemindMe! 1 week "Did OP find the noodle murderer?"
You didn't teach that kid how to make instant noodles, did you?
I just made a Reddit account right now to clear this up.
I went to this school when the photo was taken. The kid is the son of one of the coaches. The coach was PISSED when he found this on the internet but nothing could be done. He does not work there anymore I don't think... 
Damn, you need to retire that famous microwave.
This was in a school? Why are kids microwaving pot noodles in school?
he seems kinda young to be teaching at a high school
Be careful! There's a wet floor somewhere, now.
I have a feeling were going to find out this kids name is Kevin.

"Instant Noodle/Regret Kid"

He has a name you know.....
Hello! I know this is alittle late but whatever. So I am currently a student at said school and I'm not gonna say which one cause well I'm not a noodle head (hah good one) but as far as I know the story goes that this kid is one of the athletic coaches sons (not sure which sport, there are lots at my school) and one day during his dad's practice he decided to get instant noodles from our concessions stand that's open every day after school, kid gets the noodles puts some water in the cup and thinks "30 secs for this bitch would be dope as fuck." Kid pops open the microwave puts 30 seconds on the microwave and goes back to watching his dad coach. The only problem was that he put them on for 30 mins instead of seconds, forgets about them and comes back 28 mins and 50 secs later to find that his noodles became disappointmentles. He became somewhat of a living legend at our school and everyone loves and adores him. He even gave himself a nick name "noodle-boy" a ton of people call him that and he's kinda embraced the whole thing. Cool kid. Gave me some skin after my cross country practice once so now I can say that I literally touched a meme.
Liar! The gray and black cords in the background are reversed!
Everyone's asking about the kid,and I'm like "holy shit i have that exact same stereo!"...
What does he teach, Memes 101?
is there still a fry in front of the microwave?

Is the kid still black?
this exact picture was posted in a facebook group called "post aesthetics" yesterday. i think op jacked it and is a liar.

[Here's a cool page with the weather radar from that flight and how it couldn't quite sneak through the 2 cells](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/stuostro/comment.html?entrynum=33)

There were some pretty decent storms around last night, I was further east than that so they weakened a bit by the time they reached me.
Why do you get all the karma, while I was fucking [on it](http://imgur.com/m10FqZc,B5g3ybz,82OzyDd)
This us a good reason why flights are delayed or cancelled. Airlines and the military have strict policies regarding weather conditions at takeoff and arrival, and weather enroute. Flying through thunderstorms deliberately is a pretty big no no in most cases, and when squall lines can be hundreds of miles long, it can cause a lot of problems.

Remember that the next time someone complains about weather delays or cancellations.. ask if they actually want to fly in weather the pilots don't even want to.
am i the only one who for a second thought this would be a Delta flight pic from 1889
Hi All. I was on this flight. I assure you, it was not a fun ride. 
http://m.imgur.com/OLjcpcU
At least the front didn't fall off, then we would have to tow it out of the atmosphere 
In the meantime some poor maintainer took a look at the aircraft and is slightly pissed. 
Came here to see a busted up plane. Ended up learning so much about aircraft I could probably get a job in aircraft repair. 
That's gotta be terrifying. I wonder how calm the pilots had to be to keep the passengers calm. 

[Looks like they had to make an emergency landing.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3190510/Delta-flight-make-blind-emergency-landing-hail-storm-gives-plane-cracked-windshield-damaged-nose.html) That's some Day After Tomorrow shit.
I like to imagine the pilot pulled an Ace Ventura and hung his head out the window catching hail in his teeth like bullets.
That'll buff right out.

That isn't anywhere near destroyed. Get outta here Buzzfeed.
This may be a stupid question but, can't they see oncoming thunderstorms/hailstorms on their weather radar and take evasive action, change course etc? I can't believe that a hailstorm like this just pops out of nowhere.
You can see in this graphic that pilots tried to fly between towo super cells and one of them closed in quicker than they thought

[deleted]
I posted this 24 hours before and no one noticed it :(
What am I doing wrong
Hail can actually be encountered flying between 2 storms.  As it is can be violently thrown out of the clouds.  Now, couple that with the aircraft flying at say 400 knots and you can see the reason how and why this fucked up the plane so bad.  It's also highly advised to keep a safe distance between storm so this doesn't happen.

Source:  I am a pilot
Thus actually makes me feel better about air travel.
As I sit on a Delta flight, getting ready to taxi, I find this less than comforting
As an engineer myself, if I were on that flight I would write a well-thought-out thank-you letter openly addressed to all of the staff at ~~Boeing~~ Airbus for taking the time to design, test, and build aircraft to take this type of abuse and still get me down on the ground in one piece.

Then I'd write another letter to Delta, thanking them for hiring the calibre of pilots that will land a plane in this condition and get me down on the ground in one piece.  I know that the pilots also have a vested interest in getting me down in one piece, but that's beside the point.

Any self-respecting board designer finds somewhere to sneak in an easter egg here and there.  

Internally we used X-Men for codenames, there are X-Men silhouettes etched into inner copper layers on every PCB I've designed in the past few years.

Edit: I just remembered that I once sent a prelim set of manufacturing files to a coworker for review and somewhere several layers in there was an elaborate dick drawn all across one copper layer.  This was before we were using version control though, so I don't have the files to prove it.

Fun fact: In Ancient Greece, you could be put to death for destroying or desecrating an olive tree. Appearently, the ancient Greeks liked their damn olives.
I had no idea that trees could be that old and then I looked it up and there's a [tree in Sweden that's nearly 10,000 years old](http://mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=29879). There were fewer than 5 million humans around then!
Remember "The Senator"?  A 3,500 year old cypress tree in Florida.  The second oldest tree in the US.  4 years ago, some meth head decided to start a fire at its base while tweaked out.  Video'ed the whole thing and showed it off to people.  THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED years old and some meth head burned it down....

Wouldn't it be awesome if you could connect your consciousness with the tree somehow, and witness everything it witnessed throughout its life?
Does is still fruit?

So can trees be essentially immortal if they have perfect conditions? 
I bet that thing produces some dank ass olives.

[link to source](http://www.audubon.org/news/peregrines-and-photographer-bunk-out-chicago-mans-apartment)
Cool story about Peregrine Falcons.

I used to work at a coal fired power plant. The plant had tall stacks that peregrines would nest at every year, which was cool because they were endangered at the time. One day, I'm working on the roof on an AC unit and my coworker and I spot 2 peregrines flying past us. We stop and watch them for a second and we notice that 1 of them has something in his talons (a mouse or something we assumed). Then out of nowhere, right in front of us, the one with the mouse flies upside down, the other one grabs the mouse out of his talons, and then he flips back and they continue on into the distance. Makes me wonder how many people have ever seen something like that.

EDIT: Cool I didn't expect to get so much visibility on this!
Bonus Story: I took a break on the 10th floor and the falcons were nesting above where I was standing. They started gawking and divebombing at me because I guess their nest was nearby.
Write a book about it called My Side of the Skyscraper
Falcony?
Humans can barely afford a walk-up with a shared bathroom in Chicago. How the Hell does a single income falcon afford a one bedroom with a nursery and a view?
I like the how Hawks faces is like

"Please don't kick us out sir, the weather is unforgiving"
Being able to use skyscrapers as nesting areas is what helped bring back the Peregrine Falcon back from near-extinction.
"I made these."
This was the second attempt by the Falcon pair too. They lost all their clutches of eggs two summers ago :(

The apt owner is a cool guy on top of having bad-ass falcons on his porch too. Does a lot of sketch shows and has hosted a few trivia nights at a nearby bar.

Hopefully they'll be back next year
" sooo, is this going to be an issue or something?" 
"excuse me sir these are my fluffs and I'm going to have to ask you to take a few steps back"
We have a peregrine falcon family that lives right above us in an apartment in Brooklyn. What I've learned over the past few years:

* The male (I assume) is as bad as a rooster in the mornings and will not shut up.
* They shit constantly. There are times in the summer when we pray for a good rain to clean off our terrace and there are often lovely white streaks down the sides of our windows.
* They are merciless murderers of pigeons.
* They do not like to eat the heads of pigeons. They are happy leaving those as little presents for us to try and keep our dog from eating.
* They will chirp kind of cutely outside a window from time to time.
* People like hearing about the falcon family that lives above you right up until they see a decapitated pigeon right in front of them that we hadn't noticed and cleaned up.

It's not the photographer's balcony, btw. The guy living there let the photographer and the photographer's girlfriend stay with him for a little bit to get the photos though.
That is the fastest bird................... in the world.
*LET'S GO HAWKS!*
>The account caught the eye of Luke Massey as he lounged one night in his camper van near Venray, the Netherlands, scrolling through Instagram after a full day filming beavers.

A full day of beavers, you say?
That is awesome. It's like a dream come true for a dream I never had.
That falcon's derp is priceless.
Those hawklings are going to be in a real trial by fire situation when they first attempt to take flight... 
[deleted]
"Don't evict me bro, I've got kids"
Hawkward
So you know when some baby birds do a little exploring and hop out of the nest as they get older?

That position seems disastrous.
I know its not exactly detrimental to the picture, but its not the photographer's apartment. He saw the birds and asked permission to photograph them.
How do the baby falcons learn to fly? Mom feeds them until they're strong enough to fly on their own based on instinct?

I once had a dream where I walked through a hallway exactly like this and every time I stepped into a new color I would hear a note in the C major scale that corresponded to that specific color. The scale would ascend as I walked forward and descend as I walked backwards. I always found it neat how my brain somehow connected the 7 notes of a musical scale to the 7 colors in the visible spectrum while I was asleep. It's very cool to see a real picture of something I had in my head so long ago.
I love it!

Send your pic to [The Lost Ladybug Poject](http://www.lostladybug.org/) - maybe they can help you figure out what their nefarious plans are!

Seriously, tho - the LLP is a citizen-science project run by Cornell University which is trying to discover the reason why many of the native North American ladybugs have been becoming more scarce in the last few decades. They take 'spotter' information and photos and use them to identify the type of ladybug that you've spotted, the location and any other info you care to provide and use the data to try to discover more about the decline of these beneficial insects. It's a great effort between amateur 'spotters', hobbyists and scientific researchers - and the website has some great facts and photos of ladybugs to boot!
It's a lady moot. They're discussing whether or not to destory Sauruman's lands.
Long ago the insects lived in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Ants attacked.
Fun fact: ladybugs are attracted to bright buildings because their dumbass ancestral genes think *they're* still flying around snowy mountain peaks from which they originated.

Entomologist here! I've studied Ladybugs (or what we entomologists like to refer to as Coccinellidae Cucujoidea or C. Cucujoidea or Ladybugs or just LBs).

What they are doing is forming what we call a "rub nest". A rub nest is when 2 or more LBs come together and "lick" each others faces (fun fact LBs have tongues almost 1/3 the length of their bodies!) and mouths to share nutrients and more importantly, build each other's immune systems by sharing antibodies with one another. They will stay like this for hours at a time, licking each others faces until their immunity are bolstered and they can no longer become sick and die. [Here's another rub nest](http://drawception.com/pub/panels/2015/5-31/mFDfLdxNE7-2.png)
Something is about to happen that has not happened for an *age*... the Ladymoot. Now we must decide if the Ladybugs will go to *war*.

Long ago the 4 nations of ladybugs lived in harmony.....
Red & Black... Yellow Shell... Red Dots... Solid. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Red Dot Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an Solid Shell named Coccinellidae. And although his Solid Shell skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Coccinellidae can save the world.

I was in Seattle for business last summer. The first 4 days I was there, the weather was what you think of as typical for Seattle: grey and cloudy.

On the morning of my 5th day there, the clouds cleared out and it became sunny, so I went for a walk around the building I was working in, as I had done every day. 

I turned the corner of this building and I was totally taken by surprise by Mt. Rainier just appearing on the horizon. I'd looked in that direction the last 4 days and seen nothing, so I was so shocked by the size of it. It looked totally fake, towering over the landscape by itself, and I just stood there, staring at it for about the next 5 minutes. It was one of the most beautiful and awe inducing things I ever seen.

Moved to Seattle while the clouds were still blocking the view of Mt Ranier. The clouds can block it from view for weeks at a time.  Friends kept saying that Ranier hasn't come out yet. My response was "how will I know when I see it?"
"Oh, you'll know." You don't realize how huge the thing is until you see it for yourself!

so if Mt. Ranier is 60 miles away from Seattle, and a pyroclastic flow travels at 500 mph, and Bob, who is having lunch at Pike Place  stares at the beautiful exploding mountain for 30 seconds before running to his car which just happens to be right outside, how far can Bob get before he's suffocated by searing gas and choking ash as he watches the city disappear? Extra credit for what kin of car he's driving. 
Brilliant photo!

If anyone is wondering, you get this type of effect by using a zoom lens (like 200 or 300mm) and zooming in, which makes images in the distance appear much bigger. Photos like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/rEIhvQt.jpg) are also created with this method.

Is the state now going to pay him out the 27 years of salary, benefits, and mental anguish he missed out on/went through while in prison?



Seems only fair after locking him away for that long
"Yeeeeaaaaah, we're real sorry about that one"
He's the third Ohio man exonerated after being wrongly accused of the 1975 murder. Imprisoned after the testimony of a 13 year old witness who recanted his testimony last year, saying he was coerced by detectives at the time.

"Kwame Ajamu, 56, was the last of three men exonerated in the 1975 robbery and murder of a Cleveland-area money order salesman. Ajamu was originally sentenced to death, but it was vacated because of a paperwork error. He later earned parole in 2003." Only now being exonerated of all charges. 

The two other accused, Ajamu's brother, Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Ricky Jackson, 57, were released from prison last month after 39 years. 

Defense attorney Terry Gilbert said that Cuyahoga County prosecutors took a courageous stand not to fight the dismissal of charges against the men. Prosecutors also said they won't stop the trio from seeking more than $4.1 million in compensation from their wrongful imprisonments, reported Cleveland.com.

27 years. Jesus. That is a looooooong time. Even if I was guilty of a crime I don't know if I could stick it, but *27 years*. I think I'd try killing myself after the first decade.
Wow. this doesnt make it better but atleast its not
Oklahoma and he's still alive 
How people can go through something like that without coming out the other end nearly insane and full of hatred and blood-lust for the pieces of shit that put them there, I don't understand. How can you have 27 years of your life taken from you, not to mention spending those 27 years years in a cage with human scum, and not want vengeance? 
Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo
The look on his face says it all. Obviously it's great that he was finally exonerated, but this picture makes me sad. You know in those 27 years he has missed so much of his life. No amount of money could fix it, but he deserves billions. I'm 25, he's been in prison longer than I've been alive. No idea if he has kids, but he definitely has(had?) parents. Imagine losing your family for 27 years. Not to mention everyone you know thinking you're a murderer. So so sad.
You would be surprised how many innocent are locked up.
The face of a man who has been tried.
The look on his face says it all. That's 27 years of pain and anguish for a mistake that wasn't his.
That man's face. Holy shit
I'll point out the case of Ronald Cotton since it hasn't been mentioned yet. He only received $111,000 from the state of South Carolina after being wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade. His case also showed us a few things about handling witness testimony in law enforcement. Firstly, the victim of the crime had said she dedicated all of her effort during her rape to memorizing her attackers face; she identified cotton with certainty as her attacker, and he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Second, the investigators of her case made affirming statements to her following her indication of cotton as her rapist, causing her to believe her choice was the correct one. There were also inconsistencies in the investigation such as the line-up procedure that was used and an improper alibi given by cotton during his first interrogation being the only other piece of evidence used against him. CBS made a documentary about this story called [picking cotton](http://youtu.be/-2oDRfj0vME)

Poor guy. I believe he will be compensated handsomely for wrongful imprisonment though. Won't get him back all those wasted years or ease the pain of missing out on a lot of his life, but at least it should help him restart his life or depending on his age have a nice retirement. Ohio: 
$40,330 per year (or amount determined by state auditor) in addition to lost wages, costs, and attorney's fees. So a minimum of $1,088,910.
Wouldn't be surprised if this was another case of false accusation from "eye witnesses"
Has anyone noticed the look on this mans face, or was everyone sidetracked by money talks?  The emotions being expressed here are so complex that just this millisecond snapshot of what he was feeling sent shivers through me.  I'm glad this man was released.  I can't even begin to imagine what sort of indignities this man suffered through for 27 years, but I'm sure no amount of money will ever compensate for it.  
wow. Im 28, he spent pretty much all of my life in jail. Ive experienced to much wonder and wildness....all while he was locked up. My heart hurts for these people
I went to a play called "The Exonerated" once about people who were locked up for crimes they didn't commit. People would be shocked and disgusted how often this happens. 

I can't even imagine how this guy feels. Imagine, when he went in it was the '80s. So much has changed and he's just been sitting in a cell. The people who go back and work on getting these people exonerated are really heroes. 
This is why we shouldn't have a death penalty. Think of all the guys that were extinguished instead of exonerated.
That is truly upsetting. Can you even imagine? You did not do this thing, this terrible thing - murder - that they say you did. And then you go to jail for life. The thought that you are going to rot in jail forever for something you did not do. How quickly would you lose all hope? And then 27 years later, maybe after you've relinquished any and all thoughts of a life outside of prison, you come to find that you will be freed. 

All of the emotions he is experiencing, I cannot even fathom. I just want to give him a hug. 

This makes me want to be a lawyer and fight for people who are wrongfully imprisoned. 
No money can recover what that man lost. 27 years is about how long I've been alive. Think of all that time. He lost his chance at a career. At seeing the rise of the internet and tech. He lost his youth. He lost his reputation, his freedom. He probably lost himself. You don't spend nearly 3 decades in prison and not come out a different man. The system didn't take away 27 years of his life. The system took his soul. The system took everything that he ever was and ever could have been.

What's a million dollars to all of that?
As a corrections officer, this is why I treat every person under my care as though they are innocent. Because some of them *are*.

How did he get the hair on the elephant's head???
Looks like the mouse has captured the elephant's queen, and is posing next to it victoriously, and the elephant is very concerned about his chances of winning.
It's Villafane Studios. They do some really cool sculptures! They also carve some insane pumpkins! They're on instagram with different photos and angles of this sculpture.
Hey finally I have something interesting to contribute! This was made by my high school art teacher. He's also probably the worlds best pumpkin carver, and got his start doing sculptures for marvel. 
This is the best! And I don't mean that as a state of opinion, rather as an objective fact.
This picture immediately reminded me of one of my favorite books when I was growing up which I had completely forgotten about. Does anyone else remember reading [The Eleventh Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eleventh_Hour_\(children%27s_book\))? Those illustrations and the mystery behind it just made it so much damn fun to read.
Is this meant to be Ganesh and his little rat friend?
The details of these sand sculptures amaze me. Down to the hair on the elephants head! Amazing 
The artist that designed and sculpted this was actually my elementary school art teacher, Ray Villafane 
Before I saw the image, I was trying to figure out how an elephant with giant hooves(?) was going to be able to click the buttons on a tiny mouse.
You can even seen little hairs on top of the elephants head. Awesome sculpture
People are amazing when they are not being dicks!
I want this in my house
Is the mouse leaning on his queen? Mac the mouse has no chill.
I can't even get a bucket sandcastle to work. Major kudos to the artist. 

The concept is great as well. 
Do they use glues or any kinds of bonding agents in sculptures like these? Because I spy a lot of overhang.
Isn't this an Ender's game reference??

Not to speak ill of sands sculpting, but it feels like kid of a shame that it wasn't done in a more permanent medium. It deserves to be preserved.

It also reminds me of this: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2c/cc/a0/2ccca0f375f9ca32816fce049f73f0f4.jpg

but did you tip him?
My local liquor store has a dog that follows you around and waits for customers to give him treats off the counter. It's the only reason that I choose that liquor store over others in my town.
I'm not handy at all but this situation would have me in this hardware store buying stuff useless to me every time I was "in the neighborhood."
I once went to a gas station in the middle of bumfuck nowhere that had a german shepherd.  No human, far as I could tell, just a german shepherd.

As soon as I walked in, that dog lept off the counter, growling, and ran over to bite me - I thought I was a goner, but it just stood there, holding my pant leg with his teeth.  Then it slowly pulled me towards the door, and I kinda said "Okay" and started walking to the door, dog leading me by the pant leg, when I got to the door, it started pushing me.  That's when the (human) owner came out from the bathroom in the back and said "Oh I see you've met Sandy".
They would instantly become my exclusive hardware distributor. I wouldn't shop around for prices. Anything in my house breaks and I'd be on my way to the dog store. 
Labs are so kind and helpful and boisterous and they're just my favorite
This is my favorite thing I've seen on the internet today.
Ah , the store dog. Awesome ! Our neighborhood hardware store has a shop cat. All that lazy bastard does is lie on the counter in the sun. And occasionally try to trip customers while escaping out the door.

Still - the neighborhood hardware store is a wonderful place. Little old man or lady who knows where every thing is, even the gizmo they bought in 1947 and never sold. If you have one , cherish it, shop there. Because big box home stores have no souls and often no clue !
I hope OP wanted a sprinkler hose, cuz they got one now.
Good job pupper. 

Whoops, wrong sub. 
http://i.imgur.com/xxR7c6P.jpg
There's a gas station in a town I used to live in ran by some hilarious incredibly nice middle eastern dude. He trained his cat to reach out its paw and lower its head to show you respect for a tip, then when you give it a tip it puts it in its mouth (if it's cash) and brings it to him. Or pushes it off the counter into a little red cup if you use change. After that he gives it a treat. 


In Belgium, Wisconsin, the only hardware store in town is also the only liquor store in town.
He looks like such a good boy :) I want to give him a treat.
Now you can't shop anywhere else ever again. 
*Edit: Can I be someone other than GallowBoob?
Do they sell anvils?
I grew up in a small town. As a kid I needed a last minute physical so I could play sports in school. Our local doctor wasn't available so we went to an even smaller town nearby where I could see a doctor. The doctor's office had a giant lazy dog lying on the floor of the waiting room. He was breathing so you could tell he was alive but otherwise he gave no indication of life. The doctor was smoking a cigarette with the longest ash imaginable. He asked me, "Are you healthy?" I nodded. He said,"ok" filled out the form and I left. That was the physical.

Ask him a question please... I have to do some work on my ROOF!... Does he think I should ROOF! with shingles or go with roll ROOFing on my ROOF!??

Reminds me of a black lab I saw walking with its owner down the high street here in Canterbury. There was an empty plastic bottle on the sidewalk just in front of them. The dog looked up at their owner who then slightly gestured towards the bottle.  Without missing a step, the lab scooped up the bottle and kept on trotting along.  I like to think it carried that bottle all the way home and then dropped it in the recycling bin! Such well-meaning pups here!
Sure it's all fun and games until someone wants 4 cans of paint.

Of course he looks like that. He drank from the holy grail and then was frozen in carbonite. What do you expect?
You could *easily* convince me that this picture was taken in the 90's, back when he was in his 50's. Can you believe he was 40 during Blade Runner? If you watch that movie with that in mind you'll realize that H-Ford has been youthful looking his entire life. 

Tell me this isn't the face of a 25 year old.

Han Solo need to look good for his new movie. 
I'm 23, so about one third of his age. And I'm in about one third of the shape that he is in. So, technically, I'm on track. Right? 
The sadness I just felt for myself can only be cured by a piece of cake.
70 rich is 50 regular person.
TIL I have the body of a fit 70 year old man.
I'm officially done judging those gold digging 20 somethings for their relationships with older men. 
Is it just me or is that one massive dick?
Well one thing that is interesting is that Harrison Ford is an able handyman and carpenter. Early on after he moved to Los angeles to do Radio voice overs he became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two small sons. While working as a carpenter, he became a stagehand for the The Doors. He also built a sun deck for actress Sally Kellerman and a recording studio for Brazilian band leader Sérgio Mendes.

What landed him his big break is funny. In 1972 He was hired to build cabinets at George Lucas's home. who subsequently cast him in a pivotal supporting role in the 1973 film, 'American Graffiti'. Lucas and Ford became good friends after that. In 1975, Lucas hired him to read lines for the actors auditioning for the film Star Wars. It wasn't until he had done line readings for a couple months that George Lucas, with the studio's ok, gave him the role of Han Solo.

Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the behest of local authorities. During his assigned duty time assisting the Teton County Search and Rescue he has aided in two mountain rescues. On one of the rescues Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. The hiker boarded Ford's helicopter and proceded to vomited on him unaware of who the pilot was until much later; The hiker is quoted as saying, "I can't believe I barfed on Harrison Ford!"

I guess she will have to be her own best friend now.
Every time I see Harrison Ford, I get the feeling that we are all bothering him. 

I think it makes me like him more.
He chose... WISELY.
I can't believe that man is 70.  That's just ridiculous.  
I would bang that like a screen door in a hurricane.
I think I gayed a little...
Argh can't believe he is 70.. So many legends over 70 we better appreciate while they are with us : Freeman , Hackman , Eastwood , Hoffman, Connery , Pacino , Nicholson and finally De Niro who turns 70 in August. Golden generation for sure.
I'm wondering if he's on TRT.
This man is responsible for so many of my earliest lady boners. 
Whoa, so in Indiana Jones his dad was played by Sean Connery, who is 82. Only 12 years older. 
That Calista knows what she's up to. 
I am 50 and I just retired my earing that I wore for a least 20 years because I realized how ridiculous it must look.....however props to him for staying in great shape. 
24 yo here, i'd bang him. 
the earring kind of ruined it for me
HGH.  It does a body good.

First spiders are using tools, now birds are reading books! I am very alarmed.
Wow, I just found this book in the attic last night, havent really looked too much in it since I got it as a present in 99'. It's a beautiful book with all the Norwegian bird-life, really nice drawings and there is a lot to learn. So funny to see it here, after it was released about 20 years ago. Really nice picture, easily one of my favourite wildlife books.
who took this picture?
Barry?
This has /r/mildlyinteresting written all over it!
That's one hell of a pop-up book.
Funny what birds will do when you entice them with seeds. :)
OP has a seed on his finger. Burn him!

This is as close as this bird can come to Googling himself.

You may know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. 
Looks like I found a new desktop backround
Figured everyone would appreciate [these](http://www.dimachatrov.com/) as well
Probably one of the most fascinating countries I've ever visited. With such a horrible history and filthy despotic government, it's a wonder how friendliness seems to exude from 99% of the population. What I remember most fondly about Myanmar is simply the smiles. The people all just smile smile smile. So beautiful.
I've been here, you can watch the sunset from a big temple called Shwezantaw(sp) pagoda. Go to Burma while you can, I went before it fortunately started opening up and it was unlike anywhere I've ever been. 
Is this from the start of Samsara?
I think I can see four buildings.
That's Burma in old money. 
My hair frizzed just looking at this.
Praise the sun!

Act III of Diablo II was always a pain in the ass but I guess it probably looked nicer in the mornings, yeah. 
Majestic as fuck
I spent some time in Burma a few years ago and this brings back a lot of memories. Thank you.
Does nobody care about crediting the original photographer these days? I know someone posted the link to his website somewhere below, but wouldn't putting his name in the title be the honorable thing to do? Anyone can find an awesome image, reupload it to imgur, and watch the sweet, sweet karma flow, but in reality isn't it just dirty, tainted karma?
Wow this looks like a scene out of Tomb Raider.
Beautiful
This kind of reminds me of Anor Londo from Dark Souls :) Really cool picture.
Truly amazing picture.
Beautiful.
the documentary Samsara has a whole sequence in Myanmar, some of the footage is in this trailer, I highly recommend watching the feature: https://vimeo.com/46273869 
It's pretty when the sunlight streams through the smoke from the burning rohingya Muslim homes.
I've always wanted to go to Burma. My great grandmother, grandma and her brothers and sisters were from there, they had to flee during WW2 when the Japanese invaded. At the time, my great grandmother was from quite a distinguished and important family but that all changed during the war. My Grandma passed away a few months ago and I've got a little keep sake of hers that I want to take back to Burma, I know pwa-pwa would have wanted that

So how fast was your heart beating when you took this photo?
OP, you shoud checkout [this](http://vienna-pyongyang.blogspot.de/). Two Austrians traveled 13,000km by rail from Vienna to Pyongyang - without asking permission and going through the official Korean travel agency. They were inside North Korea without quides for a few hours

EDIT: Wow, Gold. Would have thought that this late comment would get burried. Thanks for popping my cherry. First gold.
One of my friends studied in China with a bunch of people from North Korea. He said that they were amazed by the plethora of stuff you could buy in a grocery store. 
If you had been caught taking photos illegally, what kind of punishment would be typical?

I'd expect your camera would be confiscated or you'd be forced to delete the photos, but was there any threat of being detained or anything?
Looking at your full photo series, these are some amazing candid photos of life in North Korea that I have never seen anywhere else.  The one thing that struck me was that any picture that wasn't in a city had food growing in it, and the hills were almost denuded of trees.
In North Korea, there are places you can visit and places you cannot visit, and the latter are far more numerous. Well, this is one of them. Usually, we were accompanied by our guides, one in the front, one in the back. But at one point they were both in the front, which allowed for a literally 15-second long detour into this ordinary shop for North Koreans. That gave me maybe 10 seconds to take this picture, before being kicked out by the "bad cop" guide, and the atmosphere became rather unpleasant. I'm not sure if he saw me taking these pictures.

Also, I've got a photo album with the photos of my journey into North Korea, if anyone is interested.
Nicely done!  Would love to see more of those "staged" North Korean areas to see the parity.
My Chinese girlfriend has been to North Korea and had these pics to share. 

http://imgur.com/a/m7CKw
What was your favorite and least favorite thing about visiting North Korea? Thanks for sharing your pics! :)
These pictures are fascinating. Just case you haven't seen before here's the Korean peninsula at night from space. Seoul the big lit-up city in the middle and north Korea almost entirely without electric lights http://i.imgur.com/nAryc46.jpg 
RIP Guide.
No lights OP?

Something always bothered me in all the pics of the last two Kims surrounded by their generals looking and pointing at things that I couldn't put my finger on...then one day I realized the flash of the camera was the light. Otherwise they were in very dim lit rooms. 
I want to say first that this kind of quality contribution to Reddit is why I love being on this website.  This is an example of a stellar piece of original content that is both interesting and informative.  I also appreciate the fact that /u/M1ckey took time out to answer other people's questions about his trip.

Thanks for taking the time out to post this to Reddit.  With all that said, I have a couple questions for you.  :)

First, did you ever have any experiences where you felt somewhat anxious or unnerved (guards acting threatening, eyeing you up, etc.)

Second, were there any Americans with your group?  I'm curious if they would allow Americans at all (I know they did in the past, but obviously they can change that at any time).  

Thanks again.  Love your pictures.  This is actually worthy of a publication like National Geographic picking up on this or maybe a story in the NYT.  Very cool.
Staggering, beautiful, eerie and quite sad. 
Do you want to be thrown in a gulag? Because this is how you get thrown in a gulag. 
Why does North Korea allow people in to visit?
Kimmy is not happy you took this, op. You have officially lost your ticket to North Korean Valhalla. 
>They also searched the laptops for any Korean films, for the Interview comedy

This really cracked me up!  *It was, like, 2 years ago Un!  Let it go!*

Also, thanks very much for posting these.  Keep 'em coming.
Can I get a price check on the veggies there on the counter?
The guides were probably killed after this and you just started the new Korean war all because of a photo jk
Thank you for posting these! Great pictures and commentary to go with them. It is amazing to see inside the country, even though most of what you see is depressing. 
I thought all the produce in North Korea was fake..
> Pro tip: You can override the firmware on your camera, so that the Delete button doesn't really delete the photos

Clever. Don't push your luck too much though, these guys are ruthless (unless you're willing to face the consequences). 
It's really sad that people have to suffer because one idiot was born with such powers to control the country and no one can change it.. At least for now..

Almost in every photo you can see sad, tired faces... That's awful.

Jacob told me I have to move the island now. 
Did they erase the "help" sign upon being rescued to avoid confusion in the future.
The "H" in "HELP" could use a little work. I would have waited for them to fix it before assisting.

Here's the San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomer's group:
http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/

Their most famous member is John Dobson, who apparently just died. He invented/popularized the telescope design that the OP's photo shows - it's called a "Dobsonian" mount.

There's a documentary about him called A Sidewalk Astronomer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sidewalk_Astronomer
So did you take a look at jupiter?
We need more people like this who want to share the amazing parts of the world, just for the satisfaction of opening eyes to new things.
Holy shit I would jump all over that.

Where was this?
On our honeymoon to Hawaii, my wife and I went to a roof top observatory at our hotel.  There were about 10 other couples for that viewing and not one of them ever stopped talking and half the people didn't look through the fucking telescope.  Here was this super enthusiastic guide with a very expensive telescope and a super dark sky, trying to talk and these fuckers were completely ignoring him while having their own conversations (loudly).  It was $25 a person and absolutely awesome.  To this day I have no idea what the fuck those assholes were up there for.  
Really Cool, not at all sad. lots of people have never looked through a telescope, ever. It's really something!!
Some people just want to watch the world learn!
Except he is blind, and the telescope is pointed at the sun.
A couple years ago while camping my kids (12 and 10 at the time) and I set up our good set of binoculars on the tripod to look at Jupiter. While wasn't much more than a bright dot you could also see four of the moons quite clearly.

As we were looking a girl in her early 20's walked by and asked what we were doing. My oldest (a budding astronomer) explained in detail about the planet, the moons, distances etc. Pretty soon we had a line of people wanting to look with my junior astronomer giving lessons. 

People are hungry for this kind of thing. All it takes is giving them an opportunity. 

And my kid learned when to just shut up and nod when some drunk guy started in about some conspiracy about satellites instead of trying to correct him.
the old shoe-polish-on-the-lookie-hole gag... *classic*
I took this iPhone photo of Saturn through a telescope like that.

Please explain how it works at day?
There's a guy that does this down by the marina in the town I grew up in. He sets up like 3 or 4 scopes for anyone that wants to look. One of them is a big Meade LX series. I think it's the 8 inch. That's a big heavy thing to lug around and set up and he does it like 3 nights a week. He's a real cool dude.
This man and his telescope alone could inspire a child to pursue science and astronomy and that would be beautiful. 
My former neighbor (an astrophysicist) used drop fliers all around the neighborhood inviting people to come join him for skywatching out in front of his house. He'd set up his telescope and enthusiastically talk about the things we were looking at. Unfortunately no one other than my family ever bothered to show up. They didn't know what they were missing!
In the tradition of John Dobson.. some good old sidewalk astronomy! :)
I think that's awesome that he is so excited about it that he wants to share it with everybody.  Far worse ways to spend your retirement, like feeding coins into a one-armed-bandit.
I miss my grandpa. :( 
This same fellow showed me Saturn outside a dark bar in New York City 20 years ago.  It changed my life forever.
A good buddy of mine got his PhD in Astrophysics . . . while he was in his program, he was very involved in outreach.  He sometimes set up telescopes on the streets of Harlem, and told me about a mother who cried when seeing the reaction of her kid as he looked through the telescope. 
That's damn cool, and perhaps THE most expensive telescope you will ever see in your entire life. That model of telescope costs thousands of dollars.

The only more powerful "commercial" scopes available are the types that are "fold-out" (look em up - basically what OP posted but with additional tubing/magnification). You will typically ONLY find these the fold-out type available to the public during public dark site meetings. 

Usually the only people who get to use such high powered equipment are those who own them, those who are in the field, and students at universities that attend classes which go to dark sites (AND, those who attend PUBLIC dark-site meetings, which very few know about).

I had the great joy in my life of taking an astronomy class (a great interest of mine, but no where near my degree) in which, for a grade, we had to attend a dark site twice. It was AMAZING. I actually got to see Saturn AND it's rings through one of these ultra powerful type telescopes. I was even able to snap of a picture through the eye port with an old film camera of the rings and when developed you could still make out the rings. 

I strongly recommend you look up local 'dark sites', which is where you will find FREE use of sweet shit like this.

I just hope this comment gets a few views, instead of all the bullshit comments that are at the top.
I would of spent as much time as he was willing to give, talking to him. A lot of people see older folks as a nuisance but I love learning and interesting talk so I often talk to older folks. Especially ones with awesome telescopes who probably share the same great interest in space like I do.
The man who invented that type of telescope mount, John Dobson, used to do that exact thing.  He'd setup a telescope in public for anyone to look through.  He died this year.
I set mine up at the local park during the last eclipse and during the transit of Venus. :)
I was reading a post yesterday about awful it is when older people act more arrogant, greedy, and just generally more unpleasant as they age. The consensus was that a lot of these elderly folks simply reach a point where they say "fuck it," and just don't give a shit anymore, which often leads down a negative route of insensitivity and apathy.

This fuckin' boss of an old man, however, has taken the "fuck it" attitude and harnessed something truly amazing. He's decided, "fuck it, am going to take my telescope-in-a-red-suitcase-with-wheels, set up shop in a parking lot, and *give* something to people. A different planet every day. No, every hour. Fuck it, doesn't matter, because I'm the fuckin' guy in charge, and I'm the one who decides which planet my fuckin' interchangeable sign will display."

It's a closer look at the universe, a glimpse into the past, and a bit of magic all rolled into one. 

Bonus props to this gentleman for wearing a hoodie and shorts. Seriously, am I the only one who's never seen an old man wearing this combo?

Imagine, in full view of the world, you take a step onto a new frontier. Your foot presses down upon a celestial canvas that has been a source of folklore, myth and religious speculation for millennia. You are progress incarnate and after your time in the limelight you are eager to see your progress become the stepping stone for even greater accomplishments. 

You wait a while and you see progress here and there. More discoveries are made about the nature of our universe. Machinery is sent to distant masses to search for signs of life. But there isn't any progress like what you imagined the first moment that your foot imprinted upon that fine lunar soil. 

You're aging now. You're getting older and that progress still hasn't been made. You wonder what landing on the moon really accomplished if it wasn't a stepping stone for even greater things, but then you hear whisperings of plans to colonize Mars. This is what you've been waiting for. This is the next step. This is the fulfillment of your expectations and you yearn to see it. 

A sentence rises from the depths of your desire and escapes your lips, "Get your ass to Mars."

If only they would do it in time.

This guy is so OG that NASA had to build larger seats on the Apollo rockets so that he could rest his balls.
Would you like to yell at the moon with Buzz Aldrin?
I met Buzz. I was at a space development conference I helped out on. Friend was friends with Buzz' public manager. Escorted to the back room where he was hiding away from the swarms. Let me tell you.

I would wear a shirt with this picture of Buzz Aldrin wearing this shirt on it.
At some point he's going to start telling people he's been to the moon, and someone's going to kindly try to find the nearest nursing home to see if he's gone missing. 
I like to imagine that he's hammered drunk and tripping hard on some powerful DMT, believing he's making first contact. 
That guy must be so satisfied with his life.

 This woman must be friends with my mother.

 There's this large quilting convention she and her church friends go to. One of the ladies has knee problems. So they all planned the whole thing for months behind her back because they didn't want to be slowed down or have to help her with her wheel chair. Then, that lady found out about the convention a few days before and was soooo excited. Mom: "Sorry! The bus is full. D: I'll check if there's any openings!" *waits until last minute* "OOOPS! Guess not!"

 And they wonder why I don't want to join their Sunday School class.
Her husband sounds like a winner too. Your sister-in-law comes over in tears, best to call the police to get her the fuck out of there.
I'm guessing Wendy didn't tell her relatives that her sister was a horrible person. They probably all KNOW she's a horrible person and Wendy agreed.
She fucking closed it there with the last line, raw as fuck. 
I'll hang out with her single sister.

>
DEAR AMY: I recently discovered that my son, who is 17, is a homosexual. We are part of a church group and I fear that if people in that group find out they will make fun of me for having a gay child.
>
He wont listen to reason, and he will not stop being gay. I feel as if he is doing this just to get back at me for forgetting his birthday for the past three years  I have a busy work schedule.
>
Please help him make the right choice in life by not being gay. He wont listen to me, so maybe he will listen to you. -- Feeling Betrayed
>
DEAR BETRAYED: You could teach your son an important lesson by changing your own sexuality to show him how easy it is. Try it for the next year or so: Stop being a heterosexual to demonstrate to your son that a persons sexuality is a matter of choice  to be dictated by ones parents, the parents church and social pressure.
>
I assume that my suggestion will evoke a reaction that your sexuality is at the core of who you are. The same is true for your son. He has a right to be accepted by his parents for being exactly who he is.
>
When you forget a childs birthday, you are basically negating him as a person. It is as if you are saying that you have forgotten his presence in the world. How very sad for him.
>
Pressuring your son to change his sexuality is wrong. If you cannot learn to accept him as he is, it might be safest for him to live elsewhere.
>
A group that could help you and your family figure out how to navigate this is Pflag.org. This organization is founded for parents, families, friends and allies of LGBT people, and has helped countless families through this challenge. Please research and connect with a local chapter.
Amy dropping truth bombs like Sad Sister's name is Nagasaki. 
I have a sister like the letter-writer.  Avid churchgoer, perfect mom and wife, etc. When one of our best friends came out of the closet a few years ago she ran around her house gathering up every photograph she had of him and threw them away. She cut off all contact with him instantly except to send one preachy email. Years later she cannot understand why he is somewhat cool to her when they happen to meet. Just clueless.
I'm glad "Amy" called her on her shit. The whole time I was reading the question portion I was thinking how much of an evil bitch the writer comes off as 
I go to church more often, I must be better...

Nope. 
I feel like some people must troll Ask Amy writers. 
I can relate to this a lot as an only child of a single working mother. She has done a fantastic job raising me for 23 years of my life thus far (living on my own now by her independent example), however there is a huge stigma between her and everyone in our family. My family is what you call.. Traditional I suppose.

The formula being: Stay with your parents + Get married + Buy a house + have a child + Raise the child together = prosperity. 

I was born out of wedlock, my parents never married and separated, my father never stuck around to take care of me, my mother was married and divorced on a separate occasion in my childhood, we moved away from my hometown and started our own lives. She was my only provider and was my everything. I have never felt like I was missing out of anything by having no father.

The reason I bring this up is simple. Despite all my mother's success in raising me and being an independent woman, the fact that she is not married and that I have no connection to my father and that I moved out at 19 is absolutely absurd to my family. We are an example of failure as a family. 

We hardly hear from her brothers and sister. While my grandfather has had three strokes and is now suffering from vascular dementia, she has always been the one there to take care of him. My grandmother constantly reminds me that I'll end up like my mom. Pregnant at 19 with no husband.. Or to keep it short.. I'll be stupid like her choices. 

As much as it hurts my mother to get the reactions that she does from her family, she will never break down and cry to them. She knows that she has done the very best she could alone than her sister who, even though is married, is miserable with a knowingly cheating and manipulative husband. She knows that she has succeeded in raising an independent child (not to toot my own horn..maybe a little) versus her brother, who is also married, that never lets their teenage children have their own lives separate from their own and require that they are present if they want to hang out with their friends. Between all of my generation of cousins, I'm the black sheep. 

The "sad sister" in this article is in retrospect my aunt, my uncle, and my grandmother. It's so sad, but life goes on.

TL;DR Mother and I are alienated from our family due to stigmas of being a single divorced mother

EDIT: spelling
She literally invites everyone including her cousin's sister in law and wonders why her sister is upset when she is excluded? 
TL:DR:

You're a bitch.
>Dear Miriam, 

>The other day I set off for work, leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. 

>I hadn't gone a hundred yards down the road when my engine conked out and the car juddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my 
husband's help. When I got home I found him in the bedroom. I couldn't believe my eyes. He was parading in front of the wardrobe mirror dressed in my underwear and high heel shoes, and he was wearing my make up. 

>I am 32, my husband is 34 and we have been married for 12 years. When I confronted him, he tried to make out that he had dressed up in my lingerie because he couldn't find any of his own underwear. But when I asked him about the make up, he broke down and admitted that he has been wearing clothes for six months. I told him it had to stop, or I would leave him. 

>He was made redundant from his job six months ago, and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum, he has become increasingly distant, and I don't feel I can get through to him any more.     

> Please can you help?

>>*Dear writer*   

>>A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults in the engine. Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the jubilee clips holding the vacuum pipes onto the inlet manifold. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the carburettor float chamber.    

im not normally such a token black guy but when i read "you dont seem to have learned much" i shouted GODDAMN so loudly that most of the science block heard it, wow that was a burn.
This sounds like how my wife's family works. All the siblings and cousins (15 or so) hang out and travel together except for my MIL and her brother, who are yearly excluded by a letter that comes in the mail. The letter goes on and on about the age differences and lifestyle differences that dictate they won't fit in with these people they've known all their fucking life.
The version of that letter published in my newspaper was a little longer. (We all know newspapers edit due to space considerations.) The part omitted read:
"She also does not have many of the same interests as we do.  Her life is quite different from ours.  We're not interested in what she has to talk about.  She complains too much about her aches and pains, and claims to have some kind of neurological disease that some of us feel is more psychosomatic than real and which she uses to avoid getting up for church on Sundays.
She also complains about her ex-husband, who left for another woman, but everyone knows it takes "two to tango" and she is not without fault."

With relative like that, who needs enemies??
"Hi God, I`m dead now. Can I come into your heaven and remain forever in Glory?"

"No, you're a cunt. Byeeeeee"
I was sitting here thinking what a terrible person Sad Sister was, but then she mentioned that she goes to church. Wendy does not. Instead Wendy is probably too busy working and trying to support her kids as a single mother. AND the good for nothing whore Wendy had the audacity to get a DIVORCE. Thank God Wendy has someone like Sad Sister to completely mistreat her and show her the light. If only Wendy was more like Sad Sister. Stuck up her own ass and a complete cunt, but, a church going cunt with enough money to take care of herself and only herself. (Total sarcasm in case that wasn't clear. Sad Sister should jump off a cliff)


I wonder how long until her children end up in /r/raisedbynarcissists...
Ask Amy bringing the heat. What a burn.
That's the sort of family and community you should escape from as fast as you can.  Bitch sister's husband sounds like a real class act.

TIL that in photography, the number of lines to flare out from light sources depends on the number of 'leaves' that make up the multi-leaf diaphragm aperture of the lens used to take the photo, since it isn't a perfect circle. The effect is caused by diffraction across each individual leaf. According to this picture, the lens used to take this photo had an aperture diaphragm comprised of 14 leaves.

*This* is why you need to be careful when buying a car not to buy a "salvage" title. Cars like this are bought from the owners by the insurance companies, and then some are resold at auction by increasingly unscrupulous people as the car goes down the chain. Soon it appears at a fly-by-night car lot, looking all spiffy... but if you check the title history (via carfax or similar) you'll find the "flood salvage" on there. Stay far, far away from such cars. There is likely damage you can't see to electrical connections, etc., that will give you headaches for years to come.
Houston, we've had a problem

I think the engine is flooded .  .  .
Real question, can a car be salvaged after something like this or is it pretty much a total loss?
That water is insurance company tears.
Either that water came up really quick and that is why all the cars have their lights on, or my preferred theory is that the water shorted out the light switches on all of them and caused the lights to come on.
Insurance companies are writhing and remodeling TOS to eliminate flood insurance

On March 30, 1996, Scarlett and her five kittens were in an abandoned garage allegedly used as a crack house in Brooklyn when a fire started from undetermined causes. The New York City Fire Department responded to a call about the fire and quickly extinguished it. When the fire was under control, one of the firefighters on the scene, David Giannelli, noticed Scarlett carrying her kittens away from the garage one by one. Scarlett herself had been severely burned in the process of pulling her kittens from the fire. Her eyes were blistered shut, her ears and paws burned, and her coat highly singed. The majority of her facial hair had been burnt away. After saving the kittens she was seen to touch each of her kittens with her nose to ensure they were all there and alive, as the blisters on her eyes kept her from being able to see them, and then she collapsed unconscious.
This makes my heart explode. What a good mama
[The story is incredible](http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/famous/scarlett.html) - four of the five kittens went on to be rehomed and one sadly died. She lived to 2008 which is a good age even for a cat who's lived a peaceful life and when reuters heard about her passing away they put her picture on their huge screen in Times Square for 24 hours! 

The mother, Scarlett, was an inspiration to many and is still remembered in many places. The North Shore League of America paid for everything and [are still helping animals today] (http://www.animalleague.org/) - good guys!

And all they'll do is grow up, and knock her keys, glasses and wallet of the table.
This reminded me a great short story:

Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we say, love. 

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye, and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot has appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. "That's one UGLY cat!!" 

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. 

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. 

Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear-Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. 

Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 

He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.

So many feels.
STORY TIME!!! When I was in sixth grade I was suspended for getting into an argument with my religion teacher. She told us animals have no feelings and don't go to heaven. So, I told her about how my cats were so sweet and a somewhat famous news story of the time (2006) about a dog that saved its owner from something, I don't remember. Anyway, even after all that, her answer was,"Well, no." I told her,"This is why so many people don't like religion, because of nuts like you!" I was suspended for a day.

I think this picture is proof they do.
Wow. I don't think my own mom would do that. Good mama kitty!!!
And people don't like cats. Go fuck yourselves
Good Kitty!
It cant be just me who thought it would be a mother catwalking through the fire the rescue 5 cats?.....
Fun fact: She likely went back for a 6th kitten to find there was none. You see, cats cannot count. When they move their litter from one place to another, they will go back after transporting all their offspring to find there is none left, because again, they cannot count.
A gold for you... that story was wonderful and tear jerking...
Look at how diverse her kittens are. All are completely different. Thats interesting. 
Wow. All my cat does every day is scratch the speaker covers and sleep in the sun.

How the *fuck* does that even happen
In the thumbnail it looked like a piece of layer cake.
This is basic sedimentation. Those are sequences of sandstone, shale, and some limestone.  Shales are only deposited in deep oceans while sandstones are deposited near shore.  Limestones are deposited only in shallow marine waters.  You may ask, then why does the sequel switch or repeat? Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so "floats" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions.

Former Geology TA here - couldn't lecture about sea stacks without accidentally saying 'Sea Snacks'.
Woooow! It looks like you could fit a whole Zelda dungeon in that thing!
Things like this are probably one reason why modern geology started off in that area (late 1700s/James Hutton), at first to try and prove the Biblical Flood record, but eventually the conflicting data found couldn't be ignored, as it showed magnitudes of difference in age. It was a tough choice, tossing out a long accepted book's history for some painfully obvious hard data. Sadly, the modern Creationist viewpoint is actually a 20th century regression thing, blatantly ignoring all that great science.
Can we make sure that Askaban isn't in there?

Here's another pic: http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Heller-David-Letterman-Beard-1200-630-07104616.jpg

And an interesting bit form an interview he gave in December:

> "You know what? I used to say, every day, 'I am so sick and tired of shaving.' I had to shave every day, every day, for 33 years," he explained. "And even before that when I was working on local TV. And I just thought, the first thing I will do when I am not on TV is stop shaving. And everybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it," he explains. "But it's interesting. I've kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I'm sort of enjoying. I can tell that people are off-put by it. And the more people implore me to shave, the stronger my resolve is to not shave."

Completely unrecognizable is exactly the look I'd go for if I were him.
He probably walks around wherever he wants, and people leave him alone. 
He's exercising, he doesn't have to shave, he's gone back to college and joined the girls' volleyball team...  

I see nothing wrong here.
It's like someone took the Ring from him and now his body is catching up to his age. You know, like Blibo.
Er, you got any gum?
if he put his glasses on it would be totally obvious
...grand maester pycelle?
When you get home from work after 35 years and can be yourself again
Wait....this is total BS....Right? Letterman had hair?!
Still reppin' Ball State, the only thing keeping Muncie, IN alive. 

Edit: Holy turds, I've got some reading to do. Figured a comment about Muncie on reddit would get buried af. Even though I haven't lived there since 1982, Muncie still holds a special place in my heart. I spent summers with my grandparents there growing up. Now I have to get nostalgic for a minute. Lots of fond memories of Pizza King (I'd kill for a Royal Feast right now), the Baskin Robbins and the movie theater it was attached to, cinnamon raisins biscuits from Hardee's, swimming and learning to play golf at the Delaware, trips to Upland to go to Ivanhoe's, Aladdin's Castle at the mall and beef manhattan's from the MCL, the urine stenched slide at Mitchell elementary, watching the cooks make the pizza at Noble Roman's, the children's museum, I'll^just^stahp^here^onions.

Edit #2: Just thought of a story about the first and last time my sister got to see the house my mom grew up in. My parents moved the family to Texas before my sister was born. My mother grew up poor and things were tough for her as a child. Growing up, she wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Muncie and leave it in her past forever. My mother, sister and I had to go back to Muncie for a funeral several years ago. While there, my sister wanted to see where my mom was raised and asked me to drive by, though my mother wanted no part of it. Let's just say the house was east of Broadway and south of McGalliard. I warned her that this would probably only happen once, if it was even still standing. I pulled up and parked out in the street, but told my sister we would not be getting out of the car. We sat for all of two minutes before I sped off, my mom in tears and my sister terrified. "Neighbors" started coming out of their homes to case us, yell at us and were rapidly approaching the car to do who knows what. It wasn't a fun trip.
Since for some reason no one thought to post a picture of what he used to look like, apparantly assuming everyone in the world has seen his show, I give you this image.

[According to ABC, this picture was taken on his show May 4th, 2015](http://i.imgur.com/znBHbdj.jpg)

I hope that helps.
He looks like the guy who used to give me cough medicine that made me sleepy. 
are.... are those old walkman headphones???
http://i.imgur.com/4qrCN9r.gifv
This is understandable. He has looked a certain way for decades (shaven, hair in a certain way, suit) so of course he would want to switch it up now that he has the opportunity. Also he might want some privacy now that he is retired. 
He was awesome the last few months on air. There were no fucks given!
He used to jog around my high school's track in Connecticut. Used to see him all the time. I'd never have guessed that was him.
TIL in retirement one ages similar to that of a fruit fly. 
Santa??
Even though you told me that's David Letterman, I'm having a hard time imagining that person as being David Letterman.
The Ball State shirt gives it away. 
That's the first time I've seen him look happy in like 23 years
Just last night I was watching some old clips of Dave on Youtube.  He was discussing with Jon Stewart how he dislikes shaving.  His excuse was something like, "I don't like looking at my own face every morning", and not shaving allowed him to avoid that.  

Go Cardinals!
Chirp chirp!!! Ball State University pride!!!

Bhutan is a tiny boutique country of less than 1 million people. They are well funded by a massive hydroelectric plant making many residence quite wealthy. The remainder of the population are rural subsistence farmers.   
I would say India has a better view
Spent my honeymoon in Bhutan. It was a glorious country. We even were invited to the King's birthday party, and met the king himself! Sounds like a big deal, but it is a small country, and the king was very friendly. Really a once-in-a-lifetime experience to go there.

How safe does that scaffolding look?
This photo is misleading. This 2006 (or older) photo was taken at 26.862284N, 89.378983E during some (albeit poor methodology) construction. 

[Streetview June 2013 showing the Gate and the same curved white/creme colored building](http://i.imgur.com/tU9A1MU.jpg)

[Phuentsholing Gate](https://www.google.com/search?q=phuentsholing+gate)

The [Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/@26.8617228,89.3799303,3a,40.6y,122.02h,98.72t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s67QQqLOWxOcmYQ7OcY8L4A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) for this location was taken in June of 2013 and shows the famous Phuentsholing Gate landmark in the background, which also is seen in the photo from further up the street. It appears closer in the photograph than it does in streetview due to the perspective distortion of the telephoto lens used by the original photographer. However, if you look very closely, you can see many of the same landmarks. You can also see the changes/construction made between 2006 (when this photo was uploaded to [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phuentsholing_Bhutan_Indien.jpg)) and 2013. Keep in mind this is an extremely humid climate.

This photograph just happens to be taken under the face of some construction that caused debris to fall into the as-yet-uncovered sewer. The sewer is now covered with concrete slabs, which now serves as a walkway with fencing and doesn't look that bad.

A further exercise would be to examine the nearby streetview on either side of the border. Then you'll see there is not such a disparity as is attempted to be portrayed whenever this photo is posted.
They need to do the needful on the India side there. 
Couple things I noticed, learned, and saw when in India for business. I was in a city, so I can't speak for the rest of the country nor can I speak about rural areas. I did not live there, I only did work and left. And before anybody thinks I'm disrespecting India, I loved my trip and I'd go back.

1) Trash was thrown on street sides. Often people gathered it up and tossed it in large piles in more centralized areas. People rummage through the trash looking for food. Then animals do the same. Whatever is left either stays there or is taken by the poorest of the poor. During the rainy season, this trash often ends up in drainage systems which end up clogged so the streets flood. Then someone is sent in to clean the drains and that person often removes lots of trash and puts it back into the large pile. The cycle continues. While I was there for just under two weeks, three people died cleaning drains.

2) The most wealthy parts of the city look like most "first world" cities. They have very new high rise buildings which are well maintained, cleaned, and they employ lots of people doing lots of small jobs. When you have so many people to employ, things that are taken for granted in other places become a job for someone.

3) Everybody knows someone that can be paid to get something done. Here in the US you need licensed contractors to build buildings and you need licensed electricians and plumbers. You need to have a contractor or your utility company come hook up power, phone, sewer, etc. I experienced more pay-offs in my short time in India than I can even believe. Right down to my driver paying off the guards at my hotel to just let us through instead of stopping us every day for bomb checks. While this social system employs lots of people that take a small cut at every level, it's obviously rife with abuse.

4) The resources required to run a single unified nation with over a billion people in it is unfathomable. And since India is what many would consider a developing country, those resources are scarce and badly needed. Imagine trying to provide medical care for a BILLION people, many of whom make the equivalent of a few US dollars a year. Imagine the public works project that would be required to collect, sort, recycle, and properly dispose of trash for a city that has 20-20k people per square kilometer! Just the amount of trash produced is staggering and now you have to pay people to collect it and properly handle it?!


Again, I loved my trip to India and I'd go again in an instant. It really taught me a lot about the world and how I looked at it through the lens of my own daily experience. I saw human beings eating plastic bags for food. I also saw the Taj hotel. I saw things that made me uncomfortable like the tourist traps set up around the Mumbai terror attacks, and I saw beautiful city streets with big box stores and the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen. I think that extreme contrast changed me a bit for the better, but I can say that not every part of India looks like this, but I suspect a lot of the areas not chock full of rich people do.

Seriously, Bhutan is the shit.

They have a law that says 60 percent of their country must remain forest.

The king is called the Dragon King. 

They are a country with less than a million people that sits on the border between China and India, and they have never been invaded by either one.

Late to this and is probably going to be buried, but I have lived in Bhutan for approximately 3 years (2002, 2003, various summers) because my father was posted there (Indian Army has many projects in Bhutan). The Bhutanese are very clean, neat and organized people. They are warm and welcoming, but this is the border with West Bengal (Which is a shitty Indian state that other Indians hate too). While a lot of India is dirty, this specific state is known to be the absolute fucking worst. Also what you're looking at is just one aspect. Pictures can be one dimensional when they don't reflect the socioeconomic status of where the picture was taken. 
They need a crying Indian to get people to stop littering.
solution for all those complaining: don't step foot in India

Serious question: was this what happened to sheep before they were domesticated? Or did they scratch the excess wool off or something?
*If I can't see me, they can't see me.*

Bitch, I'm a meatball.
There was a sheep, she said. In Scotland, I think. And this sheep escaped from the ranch. And you know they shear sheep for their wool. Well, this thing stayed gone for seven years. Finally they found it, in a cave. And there was nobody to shear the sheep, so when they found it, its wool was gigantic. It was, like, a walking afro. And it wound up back on the ranch, just another sheep, but for the rest of its life it knew that for a while, it was free. It had that and nobody could take it away. Do you understand? Im like you; I want to face this thing. Whatever it is. Were like that sheep, taking our shot. If for no other reason than just to say we did.

-John Dies at the End
Makes me wonder: is Shrek nearly invulnerable to attack from predators, since almost all attacks would be absorbed by the wool barrier?
Its all ogre now. 
Shrek is love. Shrek is life.
Is this is how XXXXL sweaters are made?
why does this look like it was shot on a green screen? the lighting is all weird for outdoors and they look cut out.

For perspective, this image was taken 4.67 *billion* miles away.  It would take you almost 8,900 years to drive there at 60 mph.

And in terms of our galaxy, that is microscopically miniscule.  Our universe is REALLY big.

It feels like Pluto is taking a bunch of extreme selfies of itself all made up and doing unexpected things in an attempt to make its ex ND Tyson super jealous
Great post of picture...and not to wax too scientific in /r/pics, but this isn't really a "sunset", because Pluto basically rolls along its orbit with the axis tilted on its side (120° specifically) with regard to the plane of its orbit.  This means the "north" end of Pluto is constantly rotisserieing in sunlight, and the "south" end away from the Sun is in constant darkness.

So think of these as the mountains lining the way into Modor, constantly in twilight.
Interesting to note the lack of crater activity. 
what are those layers in the atmosphere, and what's causing these mountain ranges to crop up? why does pluto have mountains but, say, the moon doesn't?
for scale:

http://imgur.com/20Twncl
Those mountain ranges look massive 
Question for any science-savy person: 

What are the causes of such enormous mountains? Plate techtonics? Impacts? 
I would love to know how tall those mountains are.
Absolutely amazing. Less money spent on war and more spent on giving NASA it's budget back. 
 Now we need a new edit for one of my favorite wallpapers https://i.imgur.com/p5fLTnB.jpg
Meh.  You should see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion.  Now that's something.
The title of this picture in /r/space is simply Close-up of sunset on Pluto.

It really shows how sensationalist /r/pics has become.
If that doesn't convince the Flat-Plutoists nothing will.
Do we have any idea how tall those mountains are? 
How do they take such wonderful pictures with so little light? 
How big are these mountains? Ballpark it or something i just need an answer.

There aren't enough activities on the planet to get me back on a cruise ship.  I've never been so bored on a vacation in my life.

Really fucking weird movie. Lonely dude pays random actors to pretend to be his family for his birthday. I recommend a watch, if you're fluent in Spanish.
Hardly a new idea. Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did something similar on his famous painting 'Las Meninas', in the 17th Century.

The painting depicts the Royal Spanish infanta Margarita Teresa with her maids and other aids, taken from the point of view of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana who are at the same time posing for a portrait that Velázquez himself is depicted painting (left side).

The only clue we have about who is Velázquez painting in this scene is a mirror hanging at the back of the room, where the reflection of the king and queen can be seen.

Village of young kids with sandshrews.. Pokémon isn't that far off!
had a friend from ohio who lived in florida for a few years.. while he was there he mentioned to friends back home about armadillos all over. friends didn't believe him. so, he scooped up some roadkill armadillo and put it in plastic bags and boxed it up and mailed it via USPS to friend in ohio. Ohio post offfice refused to deliver it because of the smell and made the addressee come pick it up. dead armadillo received. 

a few weeks later my friend, the guy who shipped the dead armadillo, got very ill and was in the hospital for a couple weeks with some kind of stomach infection that descended further into his digestive tract. he had to have part of his intestines removed and was touch and go for a bit in the hospital. 
Negative comments aside, that is pretty darn cute. Look how happy that kid is with that thing. 
Don't they eat them and make guitars out of them too?
Some armadillos have such strong armor that it can cause bullets to ricochet. Don't believe me? I give you Texans, guns and armadillos!

Just saw on the news a week ago that City of Houston just sent a committee to check this out and see if something similar could be done with the Astrodome.

[Edit: Link to story](http://abc13.com/society/german-indoor-park-could-be-vision-for-future-astrodome/689177/)
Would the place be large enough to have its own weather? I didn't see any mention of it in the Wikipedia article. I was thinking about the Wikipedia article that says weather forms in the [Vehicle Assembly Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building) that's used by NASA.

edit: Added 'have' to the first sentence.
There's not much water for a water park.
This picture instantly reminded me of [this](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m72mmkBr4z1qz7ejco1_1280.jpg)
Houston [recently sent leaders to this park](http://www.khou.com/story/news/features/2015/05/05/county-leaders-to-return-from-germany-begin-work-on-astrodomes-future/26955091/) to explore this idea for revamping the Astrodome. 

The [Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome) is the first domed stadium, and has been sitting unused for about a decade. 

I personally think this is a great idea. Houston is a huge metro area (4th most populous in the country) but lacks a world-class amusement or water park since Six Flags closed. And the summers here can be unbearable, so going indoors is a great idea. Now who's paying for it? That'll be an issue of course.
This is not an *old* airship hangar. The building was finished in November 2001. It belonged to a company called CargoLifter that wanted to build freight airships but went bankrupt before any airship was built. They basically only built the hangar and a few hot air balloons for testing.  
  
After that the hangar was re purposed as this waterpark.  
  
Edit: *Old* airship hangars looked like [this](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftschiffhalle#/media/File:Luftschiffhalle-Biesdorf.jpg) (1911)  
  
Edit 2: changed emphasize from 'not' to 'old' to prevent further confusion

I wonder how many sunbenches are reserved with towels.
[What, you've never seen this video?](https://vimeo.com/61845373)
Is this the place from that Deichkind video?


[Edit: Looks like it](https://vimeo.com/61845373)
This hangar was actually built in 1998, and has nothing to do with the nazis or hindenburg. it was built for an airship project called Cargolifter, which would have been used to transport extremely heavy things into and out of berlin. Before they built the zeppelin they noticed that this could not work, because as soon as the cargo would have been released, the airships high bouyancy ( to lift the several-ton Cargo) would have catapulted the ship up. But the hangar was built anyway. I cannot recommend the park in it, its horrible because there is no sky, and very non-tropical lighting
That middle part could be turned into lazy river. 
Not really old. It was built in 2000.

Edit: I wasn't referring to the photographer being killed. I was suggesting if you're going to lay in water a tarp would keep you clean.
Great photographer, he saw a good shot out of nothing. What's also great is that this couple will not only have this photo but also the memory that the guy lay in shit to get it for them.

One thing to note about this photographer is that he actually dressed up to go to the wedding.

Having been to quite a few weddings now, a shocking amount of photographers turn up dressed like it's a hacky sack tournament on the college lawn. 
Dear all men (and/or women): take everything out of your suit pockets before the photo session. 
I am sorry I am not staring at you, I am taking your picture.
My best friend is a wedding photographer/videographer, and it's honestly amazing the more I watch how much angles, lens, filter can change a shot. My sisters wedding was outdoors, and it happened to be overcast when it was supposed to be sunny and an unprecedented rain actually moved in later in the evening (damn TX weather), but you couldn't even tell in any of the shots. He made sure all pictures were taken from angles where the little bit of sun was in the background, made amazing use of the natural lighting, and always panned the video to pick up the most natural light etc. It looked so good and made my sister so happy. 
That guy has a great eye for photography. He's going places!
For a split second I thought he was dead and I thought of Rick and Morty :(

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosco_Verticale
  
This is in Milan, Italy 
  
> Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a pair of residential towers in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy, between Via Gaetano de Castillia and Via Federico Confalonieri near Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station. They have a height of 110 metres (360 ft) and 76 metres (249 ft) and will host more than 900 trees (approximately 550 and 350 trees in the first and second towers respectively) on 8,900 square metres (96,000 sq ft) of terraces. Within the complex is also an 11-story office building; its facade does not host plants.

> The towers were designed by Boeri Studio (Stefano Boeri,Gianandrea Barreca and Giovanni La Varra). It also involved input from horticulturalists and botanists.
Any civil engineers here have some insight to how this works in the long term?

As far as I know, roots don't give a fuck about concrete and will just grow straight through it. I'm assuming they do something to prevent this, maybe metal instead etc. 
That's gotta be a bitch to maintain honestly. 
hanging gardens have been built in a far away land! 
Dude, vertical forest.

COOL, BUT WHERE DO THE ROOTS GO?!
with all evergreen plantings and decent amount of moisture in the air. this is a wonderful way to improve quality of life, create wildlife habitat and keep the building cool. im sure they have pre approved plants and something similar to a windowwashing team that comes and does maintenance.
That looks like Minecraft

Super cool shot, thanks for sharing.  I really like how unique the vertical view is in terms of re-framing our relationship to trees.  Seeing the forest 'deconstructed' in a way, one apartment = one tree, really drives home how connected we really are, when cities tend to obscure this aspect by removing trees, turning that relationship from direct to abstract by completely separating the cityspace from the naturespace.  And you know it's far more than one tree per person to supply your oxygen.
How can I get this in Cities Skylines? 
I'm waiting for horizontal trees.

The army base my dad used to work at found a bunch of MB's in crates like that in an old warehouse when it was being downsized under BRAC.  Because there was no paperwork to go with them, as they were not on any inventory sheets anywhere (*probably why they were forgotten*), they had to be destroyed.  They literally took industrial saws and cut every crate in half and then in half again, then scrapped the metal and burned the wood.  I shed a tear hearing that story.
My dad owns a ww2 Willys Jeep , they really are amazing machines. We restored it in 2013 and drove from the Netherlands to the Normandy commremorations in June 2014.

Have to wonder if there is a bunch of these sitting in the corner of some Army base warehouse because of long forgotten clerical error. 
I had a teacher back in high school who was in the Vietnam war.  His job was to blow up bridges so the VC couldn't follow them or use the bridges to resupply.   Well, this meant he pretty much spent most of his time hanging around "bases" which were no more than commandeered villages.  One day, he takes bricks that were just sitting around and made a gigantic barbecue pit.  A villager had given him a pig for some reason or another, so he decided to throw a gigantic party for everyone stationed in that village, as well as any villagers that wanted to come.  Not surprisingly, he got into huge trouble, and was removed from the village and stationed in the worst, most degrading job there was.  They made him guard a junk yard in the middle of the jungle.  It was mostly jeeps exactly like this one.

Well, as you can see from the picture, these Jeeps mostly just bolt together. So 12 hours a day with nothing to do, his boredom got the best of him, so he started bolting these pieces together from various junked Jeeps to see if he could make a functioning Jeep.   He said he got about 90% there. The only thing he couldn't do with the parts he had was functioning brakes.  So he did the best he could, he bolted a gigantic pole to the side of the jeep that he could shove into the tire and pull as hard as he could to slow the jeep down.

He ended up driving the jeep around that little area for his remaining time in Vietnam, sometimes even driving around officers and other dignitaries, no one even questioned whether he was supposed to have a Jeep or why he had to use a gigantic pole to stop.
The ultimate example of "its worth more in the box". 
http://imgur.com/a/5ZgEX


Army vet here, I was stationed in South Korea back in the early 80's. I worked at the base HQ but was all enlisted were required to pull motor pool duty one week a month. I reported "as ordered" to the Motor pool non-com and was assigned the duty of tearing down and repacking two Korean War era jeeps. They looked very much like the picture. They crates had a jeep size fold-out cloth with actual sized spots for each individual parts with pictographs of where to find the part on a jeep and how to remove them. The entire process could be done without reading any words. It took me ten days to complete the job. It was a most satisfying task.

Fragiiiillllle.
Does it include an allen wrench or what?
Are these the "jeep kits" that where offered for sale for $450.00 in the back of old magazines? 
First thing I thought "Some assembly required" 
I kinda wish that I could get a modern car shipped to me like this.  It would be fun to have to put it together before you use it.  Like the adult version of Legos!

**Edit:** I completely forgot about kit cars!  So I guess this still is a thing.
They did this with larger vehicles too, I have a M35A2 and they were designed to ship in crates as well.  The tops disassemble with simple tools, windshield folds town and the highest point on the vehicle is the top of the steering wheel.
I believe they were a lot more effective after they replaced the square wooden wheels with round rubber ones

Does anyone have a picture of the bridge or whatever it is on the other side of this island? 
You may notice the town is walled - [in 1248 it withstood three years of siege.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monemvasia)
This seems like something I'd be proud of finding in a video game
I may be too late to the party, but I'll post anyway.

I actually stayed there two years ago. There is a small hotel on the island (on the side closest to land, next to the bridge). 

Here are some pictures of the hotel : [Image 1](https://d1p98clqffzjxh.cloudfront.net/lazareto/L13405.jpg). [Image 2](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cc/0f/c7/tower-and-stone-cottage.jpg).

I ran up to the top of the island every day of our stay. There's a church up there, and a couple of lookouts, one of which can be seen in OP's picture (top of the island, closest to land).

What hasn't been mentioned here is that the island and town is pretty much uninhabited - a lot of the building have been restored for historical purposes.

Currently much of the town is closed off to the public - buildings and areas that are open have been converted to tourist shops, bars and hotels. It's a pretty cool place. Perhaps when the restorations are fully complete there will be room for more people to stay in the town.

Without a doubt, my favourite part of Monemvasia is the little enclosed "pool" on the side. I couldn't find any great pictures, but here is a [pretty decent one](http://www.mediterranean-cruise-advice.com/images/IMG_0082.jpg), showing the little enclosed natural pool, which curves around and continues beyond the picture. I really enjoyed staying there.

---

Secondly, I'd like to point out that [in this conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2tupdd/the_hidden_town_of_monemvasia_greece/co2i6zr?context=10000), /u/woohalladoobop points out that the building OP is talking about is a city-owned home for the mayor to live in, and claims that he lived there. I'm calling out his bullshit.

The full comment, as it has since been deleted:
> I actually come from Monemvasia. That house is owned by the city for the mayor to live in. Fun fact: Mayor Spiros Anagna was thrown out of a window over the cliff by some townsfolk in the 1920's after he was caught having an affair with an underage girl who worked at the house.

The house isn't a house, it's a church, named Agia Sofia (pronounced ayia sofia). [Here is a picture](https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/38470106.jpg) of some tourists next to it (not my picture).

EDIT: [Here are some photos that I took](http://imgur.com/a/Qj7xa#0). The last picture is me, and yes, my face is a black box. That is the highest point on the island. Wasn't wearing my running gear that day, since I walked up instead with the rest of the family.

Well, not so hidden now...
Man, these guys are never getting Google Fiber...
Some great memories from this place! My favourite ones:

* The stairs that lead you underneath and outside the town walls, to a platform facing the open sea (The Myrtoon Pelagos (pronounced "Mir-to-on"). People could dive in, the waters are amazing, and there are some steps to help you back up. In the summer, children would joyfully sit on the platform and let the waves wash over them. 
* The view from the center of the town square facing up towards the rock and the steps leading to the top is beautiful, brings to mind something out of a fairytale.
* There are some great coctail bars up there (it helps that I spent my summer there with great friends as well)!

**EDIT: cannot format....
This town has an awesome history. For the Crusade buffs out there, when Constantinople was displaced from the Byzantine Empire after the 4th Crusade, many various Crusader kingdoms were carved out from Greece. Monemvasia held out though for the longest time as a pirate town/raiding point and proved to be a headache for the occupying Crusader kingdoms. Even when the entire Peloponnesus was under Crusader control, this one seaside enclave held out. Its amazing.

These minecraft texture packs are getting crazy these days
I've been there, it's single handily one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen
YES!!! raise your hand if you'd like to visit!
This is so cool. Do they ever experience real bad weather? They're awful close to the coast.
Nice fortifications for defense. 
10/10 would defend again.
Reminds me of Tropico for some reason. 
Looks like delfino plaza
I worked on Cruise ships and went there, one of the most stunning destinations I have ever been to. 
That plateau is an uncanny outline of ~~South America~~... 

As pointed out below, I meant Africa... Continents are hard :(
Totally looks like something from Windwaker
That would be an awesome place to be i case of a zombie apocalypse 
Hi guys, greek here, i thought you would maybe like some pics from the ground. I searched my files, found only a few, just for you (+plus extra cthulhu snacks from the local fishermen). [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ACawPFh.jpg) It's a majestic village, not an island, as someone pointed out. 

Some people are asking about the local economy. It's mostly tourism. But Peloponisos, the mainland, has a lot of agriculture too. It's one of the greek places that is open for business not only for the summer, like the greek islands, but it's a perfect destination for winter travelling too. Peloponisos is FULL of majestic, amazing places of great beauty and mythological value. It's a REAL shame that we're not doing more stuff with this place :(

Any questions, feel free.
looks like it's time to make another addition to my bucket list.
I can only imagine the property value, and what an acre of land would sell for here.

I was in Bozeman for two weeks last summer. It was one of the most amazing cities I've ever been to, with the surrounding Bridgers. 

I've been wanting to move there since. As a high schooler I came extremely close to going to MSU next year. I'll regret it one day, and it's because of pictures like this. 
Welp this proves it. The Earth is flat.

You have chosen              *poorly*
One night after a long day at work, my dad stopped at Wendy's to pick up dinner for us kids. Got home and opened the bag, and like half the order was missing. WTF? Ugh fine, he's gonna get right back in the car and drive up there and give them what for.

Hitting all the red lights. So frustrating. He's jerking around corners, hitting the gas pedal like it personally screwed up his order, just generally driving with as much huff as an annoyed middle-aged, middle-class guy can.

At one light, a lowrider pulls up next to him, blasting the bass, bunch of rowdy young dudes out being noisy. They start yelling at my dad, kind of laughing at him, "Hey man! Hey!"

My dad is in no mood to get into some street race with a bunch of yahoos or whatever they want. He ignores them and continues on, but they follow him, honking at him, meet at the next light, "Yo man! Heyyy!"

Finally he's like "WHAT?!" 

"Hey man, you got a cat on your car, man!"

Poor kitty was clinging on for dear life and of course as soon as he pulled into the nearest parking lot, it shot off into the bushes to kiss solid ground. 

The lowrider followed my dad into the lot and all five young guys piled out and spent the next 10 minutes shaking bushes, crawling around, making kissy noises, and helped my dad catch the cat. Once they caught the cat they told it: "no more car surfing, man!" 
I like to think he's making [this](https://i.imgur.com/4XiFgJp.gifv) face as he clings on. 
[deleted]
I'm actually know these people, it was on Facebook a couple of days ago. They drove about ten miles with the cat on the hay, and then another driver got their attention. The cat was ok and they put it in the truck with them. It's around the Wichita Falls area of Texas.
A natural mistake. 
"You're not taking my favorite scratching bale!"
Was this photo captured as the bail fell off the truck?  Or is the bail like stabbed on there and that's just how it's cruising down the road?  Oh hey, a cat!

Whenever I see a shot like this, I always wonder how complex the systems of the city are. Like how does the sewage, electricity, waste, and water work? And where is the food grown and how does it get to the people. It's mind boggling.

Wiki on the Greater Tokyo area http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area 

More people live here than the countries of Canada and Iraq 
[Reminds me of this picture of Mexico City](http://i.imgur.com/FPO3S59.jpg)
I visited Tokyo once, and one thing that stuck with me was how I've read a lot of science fiction that I thought was original, but no, it's just describing Tokyo.  Pretty much everything that's written about a giant city-like planet is really Tokyo inspired.

It definitely made me think about how there are surely some people who have never left that city in their lives, and just what you imagine the rest of the world to be like if you're one of those people.
No wonder it's taken Godzilla so long to destroy it.
It kind of looks like a sci-fi concept of a planet-wide city.
For perspective, [this is the greater Tokyo area superimposed onto the United Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/Eqfme.jpg)
See that EA? This is what Sim City should be about. Let me build (or at least plan and manage) THIS. 

What's so hard about it?  I just essentially need Sim City 3000 on today's hardware. No real 3D is even needed.
I live in Tokyo... this is just one direction... If you go to to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building, Mori tower, or Tokyo Sky Tree on a clear day, you just see... cement as far as the eye can see. You'll see Kawasaki connect to Yokohama, and then it just fades into the distance. Then you'll see Chiba and Saitama (which we consider the sticks) wall-to-wall with buildings. Then you'll see all the way to Takao-san with nothing but buildings until you get right to the foot of the mountain. It's absolutely insane...

At night it is breathtaking, though.

http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-gigapixel-roppongi-hills-mori-tower/#0.00,0.00,90.0
Definitely not as big as Tokyo, but [São Paulo](http://static.theglobalmail.org/cache/37/13/3713345cd59dc2ed9ec915e33f3e5c96.jpg) is also worthy of consideration.
Neo-Tokyo is bigger
Tokyo is literally the population of Canada, in one city. It took me 8 days to drive across Canada
Worst city to survive a zombie apocalypse in.
[Google Maps 3D view from roughly the same position](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Tokyo,+Japan/@35.6490331,139.533142,3087a,20y,79.5h,74.73t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x605d1b87f02e57e7:0x2e01618b22571b89?hl=en)

From this it's easy to find the big landmarks. 

Shinjuku is group of skyscrapers on the left side in the middle, which is said to have the busiest subway station in the world. At the right side of the big green park you find Shibuya, you know the shopping district with the [worlds busiest street crossing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2685/4458168800_2727610646_b.jpg),  and the cluster of "dark" skyscrapers, guess they are just being shadowed by a cloud, is just beyond the imperial palace and gardens. 




It is in fact the only city large enough for my mother.  
When I was visiting Tokyo I thought I would go out to the bar one night. I never thought about the fact that the trains might stop running at some point. So when I came out of the club at 2-3am, I realized I had to walk back to my hotel. Five hours later, after walking in a straight line, I got there. 
### it's a **MEGALOPOLIS!** 
I think I made something like this in SimCity once. The city barely lasted a week. 
That traffic must be a blast to drive in 
I like that one green spot. Like that. That is where I shall live!
Awesome shot. It always blows my mind when I see non-US cities (as an American). I think Chicago or Charlotte or LA are huge, but they don't hold a candle to the size of some foreign cities. 

EDIT: 

Been getting some responses that seem to be questioning my inclusion of Charlotte. Please note that I included it because not only do I live here and love this city but I figured size-wise it is about the same as a lot of other American cities with the exception of the big three and would make a good reference point when comparing to non-American cities. 

Here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown:

And here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown looking like Rapture from Bioshock:
http://i.imgur.com/IEaqYw5.jpg
Over 2000 7-11 stores are in Tokyo alone.
I'm from New York and everybody here talks about how amazing New York is and how it's the "greatest city in the world", but Tokyo easily gets that title in my eyes.  I went to Tokyo a few years back and it was absolutely amazing.  I was in Shinjuku and it was so nice and clean and beautiful.  I've been to NYC numerous times and it was so dirty, the streets were disgusting, tons of homeless people, just total noise pollution from cars hoking etc.  During my stay in Tokyo, over i think it was 4 days, I heard a total of 3 car honks.  3 Car honks in 4 days.  I can hear 3 car honks in 3 seconds in New York City.  So many international cities just outclass NYC, yet apparently NYC is a pride of our country.  Joe Biden's comments about LaGuardia airport a while back is really a microcosm of NYC as a whole, it's dirty, disgusting, and inefficient.  Tokyo's so great because it's like a nicer NYC, but far larger.  
Looks like a giant computer motherboard.

In summer they have concerts with awesome local bands and also sometimes have movie nights where you can just chill on the grass and have a picnic.

He [kicked ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOg_smPzq5A) in Top Gear too.
As a kid, I always wanted to drive a car like this! Too bad I grew up a cautious and rational adult. 
I miss this show, its not as good as I remember it when I watch the re-runs, but it holds a lot of sentimentality for me.  
My Mom only liked Masterpiece Theater and reading before bed, but when I was really young, about 5 or so, I'd come crawl in her bed and just kinda watch TV.  
Mr. Bean would always come on after Masterpiece Theater but my mom would forget to turn the TV off (usually she was reading or something), but I knew she was watching out of the corner of her eyes..because everyonce and a while she would let out a loud chuckle, and she'd look back at me with eyes that said "You saw nothing".  She was and still is kinda of an elitist but it was always great to have her laugh at the same thing I was.

I see Mr. Bean.
This was the cause of my British moment ever: Today I was held up in traffic due to a bobby on a motorbike who was escorting Mr Bean. I swear I levelled up. 
Mr. Bean came out in 1990? Weird, I always think of it as being an 80's show. 
By far the greatest Electrical Engineer to graduate from Oxford. ([not joking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson#Early_life_and_education))
Best episode, in my opinion.
The first time I ever saw Mr. Bean was when a short episode played in a movie theater before Tim Allen's *The Santa Clause* in 1994. 

It was [the one where he meets the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JizFAhEpiEc), and at that point in all my 11 years, it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.

I have always loved mr bean. Both my parents are deaf, and would always watch this show. Not only do I love it cos its a super funny show, and Rowan is amazing, but I always loved the fact my parents could watch it and understand everything! 

I wish I could let Rowan and everyone involved know just how important this show is to me.
Better put a padlock on my car just to make sure no one steals it. Oh I'm going shopping, I better try everything in the store before I buy it. Man I have party guest over my house but no food, wait I got it chocolate covered twigs..... Teddy 
This scene is one of my earliest memories in life. I remember staying up late watching tv with my parents when this came on. I was so excited when he was going down that hill losing control of the brake pedal with his broomstick. The second he drove into the madras van, causing the HUGE feather explosion, I had my first case of laughter cramps! I laughed so hard i fell down the from the couch onto our coir rug. Thinking about fact that I fell down due to uncontrollable laughing multiplied the laughing with a factor 10 and made me lose track of time and pain from the fall. My dad had to pick me up to make sure I could breath. I like to believe that this is what shaped me into being the guy I am today, always trying to make people laugh and have fun.
PS. Screw Rupert and Hubert!
So who is really controlling the car? 
That's so Bean... at least he's buckled and using a mop responsibly.
Rowan, you beautiful bastard...
Mr. Bean was awesome. English wasn't my first language but that wasn't necessary to enjoy it as a kid. 
I LIVE, I BEAN, AND I LIVE AGAIN
I googled him and I cant take any picture of him seriously.

On the red carpet, news, in a suit, in a tux even on the mans goddamn wedding day. It just looks wrong.

He will always be the hilariously retarded Mr. Bean to me.
Can't we just turn this into a Black Adder quote-fest.  I'll start:

"Oh dear, it's Richard III".
The PBS Chicago affiliate used to show Me Bean episodes every Sunday night when I was a kid. I loved that show.
He celebrates his own show?

*By himself?*

That's............That's fucking genius Mr. Bean.
I remember seeing this on pbs when I was younger...It was my first taste of brit culture. I realize now after Monty Python, Fry & Laurie, Ricky Gervais, The IT Crowd, Mitchell & Webb, etc that I may well have been born in the wrong place :) <3

I keep one of these under the bed in case of a home invasion.
When I was a kid in the mid-late 80's I lived in Switzerland a few years. Our school carnival had a raffle and there were many prizes. I won the "grand prize" which was a GIANT Toblerone bar. It was all one bar, weighed 7kg (a little over 15.5 lbs.) The triangle shaped pieces were at least 2 inches thick and about 5 inches tall. It was the best day ever!  I shared it with all my friends, and my mom made the most awesome chocolate chunk cookies for at least a year off of that thing. 
It doubles as a cane for when the the diabeetus takes your legs.
It's a Cesaro Toblerone. They're both Swiss. Think about it.

I would like to take this opportunity to educate people on [the proper way to break off a piece of toblerone.](http://i.imgur.com/rl2PrDd.png)
For people who love the taste of chocolate and the sensation of having plastic stuck in the crooks of your teeth.
These have been available for fathers day, mothers day, christmas etc for at least a decade in Australia. Source: bought one in Target years and years ago.
I once ate a whole one then drove to dundee in my bare feet. 
Mildly interesting: in Sweden this would not work, since we pronounce it "tobleron-e", with the last "e" sounding like in "elk".
Is Toblerone the fanciest thing in the world?
STRANGERS, EATING!
for the TILers: there's a bear standing on its 2 rear feet in the Toblerone logo. Which itself is the Mount Matterhorn in Switzerland.
would have been better as *TOBLERONEONOENOENONEONOENONEENO*

The noise of those shells hitting that would've been pretty crazy.
Ah! Finally something I feel qualified to talk about...

These are, indeed, German turrets, called pillboxes, that were designed to overlook the small town of Saint Malo and defend it against a joint American/British attacks.

Now, if you don't know anything about St Malo, here is a picture to set the mood:

https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&rais=1&oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.letriskel.co.uk%2Fimages%2Frsz_st_malo_june_09_052.jpg&sp=d4f6453f5ef9ca2a9434f0309d0103d2

Now, St Malo is an old medieval city, surrounded by enormous walls. The Germans built a fortress in St Malo proper, along with a series of bunkers in a small hill overlooking the city, the only visible part of which are these gun turrets.

They also built another series of bunkers and AA guns on an island (called Cezembre), which is about 25 minutes away from St Malo, effectively turning the city and its bay into one enormous fortress.

In 1944, shortly after the Normandy Landing, the Allies were faced with a difficult task: either ignore St Malo and risk that the German fortress would attack their rear lines (as it is fairly close to Normandy) or try take the city and suffer heavy losses.

The solution taken was dramatic: the American and the British air forces fire-bombed the city and the Cezembre island for several days, essentially destroying pretty much every building within the city walls, and turning the island bunkers into a pile of rubble. I have seen old German AA guns on that island, and they were warped from the heat.

The final operation saw British ships shelling the German gun turrets from the sea. Pretty much each turret is pockmarket with these shells, and you can actually put your fist in some of these all the way inside the turret itself. The poor bastards inside did not stand a chance.

American ground troops then swept in and the Germans surrendered pretty much without a fight. My family is from there and my father and grand-father used to tell me stories about this battle.

You can look up Saint Malo on Wikipedia, and there are also tons of other sites that talk about the place, which is very beautiful and interesting. The real shame is that the original German bunkers are now closed.

EDIT: well, my first real comment on Reddit, and I got Gold! Thanks!!
That particular gun emplacement overlooks the harbour entrance at St-Malo
Crazy and saddening to look at that, and think "Wow, look at those holes! That must have been intense!"

But then to realise I'm 30yrs old, and in all probability it was guys a full decade younger than me sitting in there utterly terrified wanting to go home.

That line between "well that is certainly interesting" and "jesus fuck, this actually happened..." is a complicated one.
Bullet holes make it look like a slightly melted chocolate.
Good grief what kind of gun made the holes?

Cause im thinking of this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtopxCjs518

Obviously its not the same quality steel but still.
Is that a shell you can see stuck in one of the holes? About a third of the way from the top towards the left side.
I went to Normandy 2 years ago while in France for work and two things really struck me:

One, you'd have to be insane to storm that beach. It's wide and deep and it was easy to see the massive advantage the gunners had over the invaders. I knew this based on everything that I have read or seen, but nothing prepares you for seeing it in real life.

Two, while you could still see and even walk into the pill boxes and other fortification that the Germans built, they were starting to be overcome by nature. That was amazing to me. In 50 years those scars will be gone.

Edit: words

Sorry, you didn't roll high enough.  That's only a glancing hit, you don't get to roll on the penetration table

Looks more like a Swiss turret to me.
Looks like they were shooting my wife's biscuits at that turret.
Other than the exploded ear drums and concussive trauma it looks pretty fucking safe in there.

*When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.*
This is crazy, I visited France a few years ago and spent a couple days in St. Malo. My friends and I camped on the hill across from the city that had a handful of these pillboxes. I was actually *just* telling my parents last night about how of all the historical landmarks I saw *these* pillboxes were probably the most awe inspiring. All of them were absolutely covered in bullet holes, you could actually find plenty of bullets that had been fused into the metal 70 years ago. There was just something so incredibly *real* about seeing these things in person.
You sure it's German? Looks more like Swiss to me.

Whenever I see pictures like this I always think of my friends' trip to Iceland... place looks amazing.

Now I understand why those carpets are super expensive 
Makes me wonder how they keep track of the pattern? I mean, how do the three of them individually decide, at each point, which color thread goes where? Are they following any guide?
Here's a good video of hand weaving with an short interview of the weavers they've been doing it a long time.

http://youtu.be/uFVkzxv_4Fs
Found one for sale here, guys:  [cheap rug](http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Nourison-Hand-knotted-Persian-Mashad-One-of-a-Kind-Tabriz-Rug-194-x-3310/6975540/product.html)
Ouch... I can't even imagine the back pain after a day of crouching like that...
Id watch the video of this,    for a little bit at least,  it is cool as hell.
That's handmade quality shit right there.
Based on the pattern and the fact that the workers are holding cutters, I'm pretty sure they're actually [knotting the carpet](http://www.furninfo.com/absolutenm/articlefiles/9126-rug07081.jpg) rather than weaving it.
http://nwrugs.com/blogs/loveofrugs/12931101-it-takes-how-long-to-weave-a-rug
Its like a human dot matrix printer
they are knotting the rug,not weaving... weaving these lies will knot teach anyone the Do's and do knot's of not tying. I will knot stand for this! KNOT!
So... Is the fourth girl taking the picture or something?
I spy a watch.
Absolutely beautiful. What area is this? Do other countries have certain parts of the land where certain industries flourish? My parents have one of these. It's beautiful, heavy & will last a lifetime.

so it's a used carpet even before they're finished weaving it.

It's not functional, piping goes straight up, meaning most of the heat goes up the chimeny. No baffling. Dangerously hot to the touch. No ceramic tiles below it means if you open the doors your house will burn down down. Couches are too close with a fabric throw that will go up in flames. Uneven bottom will mean it will be difficult to start a proper fire. Limited (no) intake control (EDIT: Draft, I had a brainfart on that). If it's a real surplus mine it will burn through pretty quickly, constant heat will ruin the integrity of the metal. A season of maple will destroy it. Good luck opening the hatch with metal handles. Also the fire looks fake.

It's an art piece. Pure design without any function. It's a concept, and one I do really like. Looks really great. Take it for what it is.
does this look like a painting to anyone else?
Looks cool, I'd worry about the lack of any protection underneath shielding the wooden floor. If nothing else you'd want something to catch embers and ash and crap when loading it up with fuel / cleaning it.

As a deaf person, I can only understand about half of what that drummer has to say.
They have a heated rivalry with the nearby Arkansas School for the Blind Melons. 
The whole irony of this is brutally amazing. Meeting rock legends with the same name as their mascot, but not being able to hear what makes them legends. It's so fucked up that it's hilarious.

Is heroin cheaper than coke or something? Is that why they're passing it off as coke?

A. When you buy coke.... taste it.

B. Never hork a full line of toot that you just bought.

3. Don't do drugs.
Amsterdam Police also tweeted [this warning](https://twitter.com/Politie_Adam/status/537866831483400192/photo/1
) about white heroin sold as cocaine to tourists.

[Video of the led screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhHN4nvgAUY)

Comment thread in the Dutch subreddit[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2nv3gx/you_will_not_be_arrested_for_using_drugs_in/) 
Avoid the classic Pulp Fiction situation. 
As a graphic designer, I love how practically everything in the Netherlands is professionally designed. 
Isn't it usually possession that's illegal, not the actual consumption?
In Australia, at school and university I was always reminded that no matter what the person has ingested, legal or not; it is always safe for them to ring an ambulance. They will only ring the police if there is a dangerous and violent situation.

Paramedics are there to save your life, not to criminally charge you.
Little story about some of the victims involved in this.

2 British tourists collapsed on the street after buying and using cocaine that turned out to be white heroin sold as cocaine, both got brought to a hospital. 

After they get some medication one of them decides he feels fine and bails. When the hospital staff realizes he's gone they inform the police who eventually track him down that same night, he was quite easy to spot since the first responders cut open his clothes to get to his chest and he was wearing those clothes. 

He refuses to go back to the hospital, the police have no choice but to detain him and put him in a temporary holding cell where they continuously check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know the exact details on this but he stops breathing/heart stops, the EMT starts CPR. Gets picked up by an ambulance and dies on his way to the hospital.

Meanwhile, at pretty much the exact moment the other guy stops breathing too and survives because he decided to remain in the hospital.

TL;DR: 2 tourists use white heroin thinking it was cocaine, one of them dies after leaving the hospital and the other lives.
That's a PSA you will never find in the USA. 
Where in the world do you get arrested after going to the hospital for an OD?
The red-light district in Amsterdam has some pretty dodgy characters. I found the tip is to never stop moving, do not even acknowledge the existence of people trying to sell you things and above all do not show how stoned/drunk you are. 
What are the three red X's in the upper left corner of the notice? A way of indicating urgency?
Which shoulder muscle?
Smartest public health sign I have seen in a long time.  Many people will read this because of the "Cocaine Alert" and most of those aren't planning on buying cocaine.  But, they will remember it if they see someone with those symptoms and know what to do.  Right on and keep it up!
And these huge signs help also

There's electronic signs all over the busy tourist spots conveying the same message. It's quite comical sometimes how dealers approach you so openly around the common bar areas like Rembrandtplein.
Its amazing to see that they actually care and not just let drug users die.
Here is a little story from personal experience if you feel like reading something. I currently work in the caregiver field for developmentally disabled adults. Upon starting the job, you find out that the mental illnesses you're dealing with are really just the extreme end of a spectrum that a lot of totally normal people with high IQs are also on. They're really not that different from us besides the fact that for a lot of conditions, their brain cannot resist the urge to do something even when it knows it's wrong. We can know better and learn and resist urges but no matter how many times I teach a client something, when the situation comes back up, the chances of them retaining the knowledge are unfortunately pretty low (but not impossible). With that being said, the following story is about someone with dev. disabilities, but the reactions their brain are having to the events in the story are totally normal and something that we all experience.

You quickly realize that the #1 trick to stopping acts of defiance in your client is to not give them something to defy.

For example we have one girl with oppositional defiance disorder. There is a set time for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, snack in that order. She constantly will cause a scene or have a documented behavior because she wants food at the times that aren't set for food.

Now she is an adult, and she should be allowed to have food any time, but we realized that it wasn't even about eating, it was that she HAD to break the rules. There was something about a rule for her that caused her to want nothing more than to overcome it and break the rule. It has a lot more to do with wanting personal control over your own life, but we call it the forbidden fruit effect.

So we solved her issue by taking away all snack times, dinner times, lunch times, breakfast times, and letting her tell us when she wanted to eat. When she wanted a 3rd or 4th snack we gave it to her. We weighed her after a week and she had gained 10 pounds in literally 1 week.

She was very upset and we explained to her the natural consequences of eating too much. We taught her how to eat healthy and feel healthy. We told her she can still eat whatever whenever she wants.

"No I want to eat healthy, I don't want to be fat."

From then on she asks for one snack or no snack after dinner. She doesn't go crazy anymore trying to get food at times that she isn't supposed to have it because we totally took away the whole matrix of scheduled times and calories and all that stuff. We took away all of the rules to break and replaced it total freedom coupled with personal accountability.

I really believe a lot of the things people do, especially teenagers, are done 10x more because you're told not to do them. No one wants to be told by another human being with just as many flaws and shortcomings as them that they're not responsible enough to handle their own shit around some food or a drug or whatever else it is that's being forbidden.

**TL;DR A recount from an experience I had working with those with developmental disabilities that relates to the whole idea of the forbidden fruit effect. We took a girl with oppositional defiance disorder who consistently wanted to defy all the house rules and removed every rule and let her control her own life, but showed her the natural results of eating too much or not being responsible. She learned that being in control means it's on her and no one else to make the right choices, and she started making them.**

My dad did the same sort of thing, decades ago. They painted all the fire hydrants in town, but missed one.  He stuck a sign right next to it "what about me?"  I was about ten, and it was the first time I time I discovered he had a sense of humor
I posted this on the original in R/Wales :  
 I worked with a property manager. This is very common, the budgets for maintenance paint jobs are non existence, it's the least important thing. However if something is vandalised with curse words, it then becomes a critical priority to repaint it.

I know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it.
Survey says..."This is not a camera"
I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it?
Those hats are adorable.
I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this "camera". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. "excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were "taking pictures of people in their homes" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police.
I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, "take my picture!  take my picture!"  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a "hey, come here and look at this.."  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.  
That is so fucking cute.
I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were "Are you guys about to widen the road" and "Don't take my picture with that". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.  
lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses. 
I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. "Oh taking pictures, smile!"

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave. 
We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, "It's actually not a camera." Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, "Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures." With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole. 
I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!  
Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks "how do you ride that thing?" I replied with "I clinch my cheeks real tight."
Aw thats adorable!
Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background.
I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: "I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off.
I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.  Which would probably be the most boring subreddit.
Used to annoy the hell out of me when I was working with a surveyor, "Do you wanna take my picture?" No, it's a theodolite, it does not take pictures, it measures angles and distances, and even if it WAS a camera, why on earth would I want a picture of you?
I have always wanted to know what one actually sees when looking through one of those. 

edit:spelling
Ha, kids are fucking dumb. Look at those fools. It's like they don't even know what surveying equipment is! Amateurs.
ELI5 what do they do with those things?

Excuse a dumb Texan for asking, but why is the water so clear after the ice melts? 
Here's the original article from the Smithsonian Magazine. Although these shipwrecks aren't especially deep, it is still pretty eerie... or beautiful. Not sure which yet.

Wow it's funny how much it looks like a fossil
The Edmund Fitzgerald?
[deleted]
It looks like that one part from Pokemon Ruby where you have to surf to the sunken ships and dive down to them... But then again Im super high 
The reason the lake is clear is because of zebra mussels and other invasive species filtering the water. Its devastating to the eco-system, killing birds and fish. Its cool to see the shipwrecks but its extremely bad for the great lakes.

That's super cool... I live pretty much on Lake Michigan and had no idea.  Now I wanna take up diving lol.
Lake Ontario is still full of sewage and gross shit. It's actually disgusting near Rochester,  NY. 
A bit of [hue magic](http://i.imgur.com/WfRpulD.png) and now it's a shipwreck on mars
There's usually a couple of days to a week or two where the waters look like something out of tropical vacations brochure out as far as the eye can see.  Unfortunately, it's 40 degrees and the water is still around 35-38 so there's no swimming.
Ok, I don't want to alarm anyone but I'm pretty sure that is the Millenium Falcon.
What's the current environmental condition of Lake Michigan like?
How rude! Somebody built their house right next to that lovely shipwreck!
It looks like Luke's crashed snow speeder.
I was there once and they had a tour with a glass bottom boat where you could check out all kinds of wrecks. It was pretty awesome, though kind of creepy.

Four years ago I spent a couple days in the Dolomites at Passo Brocon in northern Italy. I took a long day hike up the mountains above the hotel and found a WW1 gunnery nest. It was mid-September and already pretty damn cool up there. I jumped inside the nest and looked around. The soldiers had a nice view of the area, but they were also totally exposed. The wind whipped over the little hilltop. Then came a sudden thunderstorm. I had nowhere to hide and got completely soaked. As I high-tailed it down the mountain to my hotel, I thought about those soldiers who were stuck in that nest in winter. Holy shit, that would have SUCKED. 

I got hot coffee and drove the 17 miles to town to get new shoes (mine were muddy and filthy). Those soldiers couldn't. They were stuck in the frozen mud for weeks at a time. And now some of them are unearthing.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/10562017/Melting-glaciers-in-northern-Italy-reveal-corpses-of-WW1-soldiers.html
I'm starting to believe nothing in [Encino Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xkTN1Z1rTQ) was scientifically accurate! 
So... Can these corpses be viral carriers?
Imagine that being you. Just dead, nobody knowing for sure whether you died or just never returned, nobody knowing how you died or where you were; and when your body *is* finally discovered, anybody who would've cared is dead now too.
It's kind of crazy that when that guy woke up that morning he had no idea he would be killed and begin a 100 year journey through a glacier that would end in 2015 where his picture would be posted across the world for people to look at on their phones, computers, at the bus station, a restaurant, or even sitting on the toilet. I bet he would have stayed in bed had he known that. 
Captain Italia looks like he needs a little time to readjust
 They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and terrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Otto von Bismarck had "ended" (after a hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army to aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir of Bismarck. 
And my hunt for Captain America has just made a little bit more progress. 
Just imagine that was probably some poor woman's husband that she never heard from again...
Grim? Check. 
Frost bitten? Check.
Death? Absolutely.

And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
If they were frozen in glaciers, why are they not better preserved?

Draugr de Italiana.
If anyone is interested in WWI, there's an awesome channel on YouTube that has been doing videos on what happened that week 100 years ago. I highly recommend it.

Why would the be there in the first place? Were the glaciers smaller at the beginning of the last century?  
Edit: Spoiler, they weren't. 
That doesn't look like "emerging." That looks like "dug up."
Apparently the real threat of global warming is zombies
TIL: Italy has glaciers 
Tell me when they find Captain America
You know, I've just realized there's a disturbing lack of WWI themed zombie flicks.
To think they had families that waited for years for them to return home after the war, probably would go to the entrance of their village every single day with hope that they would see their boy walk through the village entrance never finding out that He is never coming home
Is he ok?

Having lived in several countries, The Netherlands is one of the countries where the police are the best in my experience.

I'm sure there are a few bad ones, but from experience the ones I've met have always been friendly, helpful and kind. Never have I seen one going on a power trip. They spend a lot of time actually serving the public.
Netherlands mentioned?

KARMATREIN
I was in Amsterdam one night smoking a big joint on the street - blazed out of my mind - when two cops walked towards me. For a moment I freaked the fuck out and was about to toss my joint. Then I remembered that I was in Amsterdam. The cops just laughed at me and kept walking. Good times.
Grime fighters. 
I think everyone is missing the point here. There are two hot cops in her house cooking and doing dishes. I don't think I've ever been more turned on. Lol. 
there really are good cops everywhere, just the bad cops make more headlines. 

the night my grandma passed away. she called the police because she was scared. the cops came  and sat with her for 3 hours. they didn't need to do that, but they were comforting her. those were the last two people who saw her alive unfortunately, but i'm glad there were some nice people looking out for her. 

she passed away later that night, no one could have known that was going to happen.
The one on the left is a total babe. He can wash my dishes, if you know what I mean.

The one doing the dishes has such strong shoulders. Be still, my heart.

Goede actie.
Just an FYI to the folks who are confused about hypoglycemia...most likely this woman has diabetes, probably Type I which is insulin dependent. Anyone who has this knows what a royal pain in the rear it is...constantly checking your blood sugar, adjusting your food intake, insulin intake, activity level to attempt to simulate a non-diabetic's blood sugar. Even with constant vigilance, your blood sugars can dip low or go high, for sometimes unknown reasons (is this infusion set on my insulin pump blocked? I worked a little harder raking the leaves and didn't eat enough...I have a cold, maybe that's why my glucose is high? Etc). Managing the disease is a total balancing act. This mom prob went into hypoglycemia because it was dinner time and she was going to eat soon but her blood sugar dropped too low before she got a chance to eat,and she got confused or was behaving abnormally or became unresponsive. Scary stuff. I am glad the police helped her out like they did. 
Serious respect for these guys. They're the model that all policeman should follow.

Also I hope at least one of them is single.
And these are the guys that had to fight and go on strike to get a better CAO (collective agreement), incomprehensible. Goeie jongens.
Most of redditors are from Netherlands.
I was reading this thinking "Woah! This is totally unheard of!   ... Oh, Netherlands, well then it makes sense"

Edit: I was just expressing my initial reaction to reading this. You're all right of course, that there are plenty of American police with good intentions, and it gets drowned out by either bad cops or just that it's hard to be nice when you're surrounded by gang violence...  FTP - Fix The Police ... And also inner-city/organized crime
If this had happened in the United States the woman would have hired a lawyer and sued the cops, their department, and the city.  
Well when the crime rate is so low you don't have a couple dozen report/complaint calls stacked up to go to after the current one (not to mention whenever high priority calls come in in-between) you've got time to cook dinner and do dishes. 

 Personally, I think the good cops (not the minority haring trigger happy ones) would have a much better time at "community relations" if they were better staffed or crime was lower.  This is probably why old people remember friendly cops who they got to know and such. Those cops has fewer calls and more time to reach out.
Tijd om 112 te bellen! Ik ruik m'n afwas vanaf hier...
Not gunna lie, hypoglycemia is a bitch. 
I lived in Eindhoven for a while and can honestly say it's one of my favourite places, if only because everyone seemed so nice and welcoming. 
A great country where the police doesn't have much work to do.
The dutch police is awesome. I often go to big festivals in the Netherlands... and the police is always in a good mood and I've seen many times police officers dancing to the music ;-)

It's a pretty good bench, I guess.
Thank you for sharing! I love Bryce canyon so much. My aunt is a ranger there and i have a few cousins who live close by. Seeing that picture brought some good memories. I miss them ... 
Bryce Canyon is one of my favorite places on earth. It's so incredibly beautiful and awe-inspiring.

Man, this would kill over in /r/bench.
I dunno that bench doesn't even have a back on it.
There is no way I'd get close to that bench without crawling.  My fear of heights is so real I'd probably lose my balance 10 feet away, and run off the side.  An onlooker would see it and then everyone would believe I committed suicide even though I screamed the whole way down.

Utah is a wonderful state to go explore. Pictures of Arches/Zion/Bryce National Parks hit the front page frequently. It's a shame people only associate it with Mormons. 
Now redditors can add this spot to the "Reddit Pilgrimage List" (trademark pending), along with that outdoor beer patio in mountains of Switzerland, or Austria, or wherever it is.

I would be afraid to sit on that in case somebody would come from behind and push me down the hill.
This looks like Bryce Canyon in Utah. It's a truly astounding area for hiking, camping, horseback riding, mountain biking, and so much more. 
And I'm sure for a few people it has also been the last bench they have ever sat on.

When I was a wee lass I ran into my dad's office and declared myself a fairy princess with wish granting abilities. He asked for a raise, so after bopping him in the head with my wand he got a call and told me to flutter away. Minutes later he called me back up and told him his boss had just called and given him a raise. He and mom both insist to this day it was a complete surprise. And my mom is the kind of person to call bullshit on my dad's shennanigans.
Yeah,but when I dress like a fairy to heal people with my wand and kiss people on their brow,I get thrown in jail

Technically that's during coffee
Am I the only one noticing the subtlety of the eyebrows and mouth? In the first drawing the figure is scowling/frowning slightly. In the second figure it's completely even. The figure has reached homeostasis, much like a habitual coffee drinker. They are addicted so until they get their fix they are cantankerous. The coffee makes them feel normal. This is a very astute social commentary.
way to get that from Tumblr
Both of these are before coffee.

Be sure to get regular lung cancer screenings because of all the dust and she have to work with while on covering all the rocks because it's not very healthy for you and because I reading reading a book about a paleontologist that meets an alien and has lung cancer because of all the dust he has to work with and he never really thought about the cough he had because he just attributed it to the sandy and dusty environment that he always has to work in. I'm really high and I have no idea where I'm going with this.
As a paleontologist, omg why didnt i think of this?
Party animal paleontologists.

Can anyone pls tell me where they sell this trex costume ?

**NO!**
thats.. disturbing
laugh all you want, that's the face of a predator.
oh please god no.
This needs to be a thing with all animals.  STAT.
At least that stops the bobbing (pigeons bob their head back and forth to see depth).
Spider eyes
That's... unsettling 
This needs to become a thing. Animals normally with eyes on the sides with eyes in front.

It's very distracting to exercise with a lime on your head.  Seems rather self-evident to me.
Because the product is sublime. 
Someone please come up with a reason. I can't think of anything that makes sense

Hey guys, look over here, /u/Peakoe89 doesn't know how to play heady-limey!!!!
Clearly, that woman is sublime.
She's got lime on her mind while she's touching her behind.
The lime is integral to the exercise experience.  If you do not use the head lime, you are no better than a cross-fit newbie and aren't getting any value from the exercise at all.  You will probably hurt yourself and your margaritas will never taste any good.   
That's no lime, she's a sim!
Lime for scale.
I'm trying to think of some possible reason as to why she might be holding a lime on top of her head and I'm coming up with nothing.

All I can think of is that the box design was done on the cheap and that the designer used that image as a joke.
She put the lime on her coconut. 
Apply directly to the forehead.
More importantly, why is the product called "exercise wheels" when theres clearly only 1 wheel?

Just a guess:  You create a dresser with really thick walls and fit the drawers in to it first.  Then you go back and create the awesome wavy designs.  

Super-cool though.
That edge on the right looks a little risky
This is really Trippy, I wouldn't trust this thing with my clothes. 
This looks expensive.
Looks awesome by itself, but I can't figure how you'd get that thing to coordinate with the rest of a room's furnishing. 
How do you open the drawers?? 
Real dressers have curves.

Feed it a pea, it will get better, had a fish that would swim and float upside down and did that for over a year until my mom found out this little trick and it actually worked really well. 
What was wrong with this?

http://i.imgur.com/nm0KlHW.png
Feed it peas, it has a messed up swim  bladder, 

 - Source had a 20 year old goldfish
i need to know op, did you give him a pea yet? 
I feel like this is some extreme fish who just got hurt on his last stunt. Give it a few months and he will be back to touching butts n stuff.
We did this for one of our fish that had a swim bladder infection and was floating on the top, except we gave it blu-tak ballast tanks underneath. Kept the fish alive long enough to heal up and lived for many years afterwards 
If a person is handicapped, is a fish *fin*dicapped?
Pretty sure it's useless to tell the OP to feed it a pea as it isn't OP's pic or goldfish to begin with. Did a qoogle img search and here's the same pic on a diffrent forum about two years ago http://forum.simplydiscus.com/showthread.php?103425-Disable-Goldfish/page2 probably not the original source but it's used as an example here.
How will you know when it's dead?
Stop feeding it so much. Feed it once every 3-4 days until the fish passes all the bacteria, and goes right side up. Then feed it once a day. Too much protein-laced Goldfish food. If you really like your goldfish, feed it a veggie-based  salt-water flakes/pellets. (Food for salt water fish) It is the same stuff, just better quality. These fish are bred to be shaped like that, unfortunately the process has left them with a sensitive digestive system even though they want to eat their weight in flakes every feeding it is so bad to let them.
-Ex Fish store Manager 
Your fish is constipated, give him epsom salts, and less food. 
This is cute as fuck. 
Get Xzibit stat. New show... Pimp my goldfish. 
Thats the luckiest fish that had trouble staying upright ever in history. 
IIT: Peas. Peas everywhere.
I'm amazed no-one has commented how much this looks like a fish cosplaying as a cigarette.
[deleted]
whether the fish was injured?
OMG LOOKITHIM
This is caused by swim bladder disease, where the fish's swim bladder is compressed or damaged because of constipation.

To remedy this, fed the little guy some peas (laxative) or buy some medication (preferably feed him peas.)

That is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my god damn life.
I did this for my fish.  He died after about a year.   I think it's something to do with their swim bladder.  The fancy goldfish are prone to it.
I loveeeeee youuuuuu OP! Thanks for doing that, so many people don't care about their pet fish but they're just like a dog or a cat and deserve the same attention :) May I suggest treating him with anti bacterial medication and feeding boiled and deshelled peas as well? He will be well again in no time. Good luck!

My buddy's dog doesn't take any shit. He just assumes the ball is fair game after the "throw" and tackles you.
I pulled this trick on my dog constantly until she just stopped bringing me her ball and trying to play with me.  Now we're pretty much just roommates that ignore each other and sometimes I forget to feed her.

Those medals are the equivalent of the City Keys.
Apparently those guys will be staying a bit longer in France.
They are currently being interviewed by the French counter-terrorism agency, soon after they will be heading to Paris, invited to a reception at the Élysée Palace with the Président Hollande.
More medals to come.
Oh and well done guys !
Are those blood spots on the old guys shirt? That's a pretty quick turnaround on the medals!
From left to right: Anthony Sadler, American student at California State University Sacramento; Alek Skarlatos, member of the US National Guard from Oregon; Chris Norman, British consultant who lives in France

Everybody is mixing up branches of the military and the names so there's the right information (according to the article).

Skarlatos's friend Spencer Stone is not pictured but grappled with one of the gunmen. The three pictured are meeting the French president later
Excellent work, Lakers and Bayern fan and Old Dude.
TIL: The French apparently have bravery medals on standby to award to foreigners.
"Spencer ran a good ten metres to get to the guy and we didn't that his gun not working or anything like that, Spencer just ran anyway and if anybody would have gotten shot it would have been Spencer for sure and we're very lucky that nobody got killed, especially Spencer," said Mr. Skarlaatos. 

**YES BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO SPENCER**
At first glance I thought the middle guy was actually Mario Götze
This is CNN:

I'm not gay but I'd let the guy in the middle save me any day.
Which one is of which nationality? 
I didn't know Memphis and Gotze were in France
"As he was cocking it to shoot it, Alek just yells, 'Spencer, go!' And Spencer runs down the aisle," Sadler said. "Spencer makes first contact, he tackles the guy, Alek wrestles the gun away from him, and the gunman pulls out a boxcutter and slices Spencer a few times. And the three of us beat him until he was unconscious."
That guy in the middle looks like one strong mother fucker. 
The train incident from today???
What the hell. Norwegian news papers just reported that the two soliders were "badly injured". One with gunshot wounds and one with stab wounds. Doesn't look like that
Allah may indeed be Akbar but these guys are Akbarer.
Go Lakers, bitches
Middle guy's like "Would have rather had reddit gold"
I'm sure they went ahead and preemptively inscribed them in English. 
The thought that a wannabe murderer of innocents got punched in the head repeatedly until he lost consciousness, brings pleasure and joy to my heart. Good work, Americans!

That looks terrifying. Like some post-apocalyptic wasteland...
Having lived through High Meadows, Buffalo Creek and Haymen fires I can relate to the terror.  Most people probably don't realize how bad the air gets, how much your lungs burn, or the stench that a forest fire really brings on.
[this guy](https://instagram.com/frostjeff/?hl=en) has some really cool photos of the fires
My family farm is in Riverside Wa, and barely scraped by.  Fire on three sides within a half mile.  

No way my uncle would evacuate, but it was pretty hopeless when the power went out and the sprinkler pumps quit.
Here are some pics from space:

That looks like the worst thing to happen to WA since Pete Carroll decided to throw the ball on the 1. 
My good friend Robb Sarsten is there. Building fire breaks with his own equipment. 
When you look back and realize everything you left behind is gone

I live in Seattle, and the haze is awful, I can't imagine what it's like near the fires. Most of central Washington is on fire. Glad you're safe OP.
I hope your doing okay OP, home and all. 
I've been through something similar to this, in New Mexico. It fucking sucks.
This may be a stupid comment, but it blows my mind that the fires on the west coast have produced a thick haze all the way over here in Denver for the last couple of days. I could barely see the sun setting and the mountains last night and I live in the foothills. 
Yeah, we got all your smoke over here in the Auburn Valley. It just, sits there... Like most of the people around here.
On the plus side, all that smoke will go up into the sky where it turns into stars.
So it looked like Hell?
I've been to Kvatch before, I know how this ends.
"If you're going through hell, keep going" - Churchill
At the end of the road lies The River Styx.  
 Do you have any "before" pictures of this area ?  To compare to...
The entire state is covered in smoke right now, all of it; Beijing smog end to end. I knew my town was smokey the last couple days from the fires but I didn't get a grasp of just how widespread this was until my cross state road trip today. There's over a dozen different wildfires in Washington right now. 
We were evacuated - daytime - from Chelan last weekend.  Was a very bizarre adventure.  Thank god we have amazing folks out there risking their lives to save our homes and land.
Jesus man, I hope you and yours are all Ok. That looks positively otherworldly. I've been through 3 big'uns (bushfires in Australia are fucking insane) and it is impossible to explain how scary and humbling it is.

I can only hope to achieve his level of boss. 
Damn I wish I had a giant oil painting of Phil Margera too...
Your boss is a slightly larger version of [Steve Wozniak](https://imgur.com/bI3oUT8)?
The painter or commissioner must really love this guy.  Not just the incredible cost of a portrait like this, but more deeply the reflection of the subject in the piece.  You see a kindness in his eyes, the love he radiates to the audience.  No idea what kind of person the subject is irl, but to me that is what the painting is trying (and very much succeeding) to convey. 
The artists name is Scott Lenhardt. slenhardt.com
Reminds me of that scene in The Sopranos where Pauly commissions a painting of Tony standing next to the race horse, dressed like Napoleon. 
This is a rare, grand gesture in this day and age. I don't know how I would respond. Good for you guys.

Cliff notes: the boss's two cofounders commissioned the painting last fall to commemorate 10 years in business. They built the company from nothing - a loose collaboration of friends - to a multi million dollar design, advertising and digital development firm that works with Google and Nike among many other heavy hitters. 

So proud of all of them. You have no idea how much this means to all involved. 
Good thing oil is so cheap right now
"Is that impending death coming behind me?"
That would be awesome to hang right behind his desk in what I can only hope is a comically small office where the picture frame has to be wedged between the walls. And under the painting a torn off piece of paper hanging by masking tape which reads "Picture of Me. By: some painter" scrawled in crayon. 
If possible, can OP elaborate further? Who's the boss / company? Why an oil painting? Did employees pitch in together to make this happen? So many questions...

Oooh I want one of those young ones.
Not Bobcats
I used to work for Caterpillar in the yard as summer help. I learned how to operate all of this equipment. The 9 series loader can cost most than $1 million depending on the options. It always made me nervous to load one of these on a lowboy trailer, because you have an inch or two to work with before slipping off the edge and hurting/killing yourself or someone else. 

3 series mini excavators are super useful in tight spaces. They are a lot like the old moped/fat chick jokes. They're a lot of fun until one of your buddies sees you riding one. Best summer job I ever had.

Good on him. A lot of people don't realize that bringing a cold animal inside the house only stops them from losing heat as fast, they still have to warm up via metabolism. You have to put them in something hotter than body temperature to actually help them raise it. Body temperature is pretty hot.
That's a fucking nice jacowzzi 
The care that these farmers give their animals is just amazing
The lengths some farmers will go for their animals is heart-warming. I remember my ex-bf had a cow that was born in the winter and needed to stay warm overnight while the temperatures went below freezing so he brought the calf upstairs and slept with it in his bed. 
Hot Tub Milk Machine
The proper way [to raise its body temp](http://keeponamazing.com/sites/default/files/Grill%20Safety%201600x900.jpg).

edit: grammar 
Farmer Jim acting quickly when his wife caught him in the hot tub with a young calf made up a genius story about how it was frozen winning the hearts of many and making national news. 

But I know your secret Jim.
a real farmer, he loves his job  cool  man
hot tubs: no farm is complete without one.
Calf Life 3 confirmed. 
Is that boogie2988?
A cow is an intelligent animal, like a four year-old human being. It must be hard to make it your job to tend and care for these creatures, trying to remain objective, thinking of your bottom line and thinking of your animals like goods to be bought, sold, and slaughtered. 

But the fact of the matter remains that . . . you feel an enormous amount of responsibility for these animals. If I knew that a calf had frozen to death slowly over the course of a day and a half, I would feel tremendous guilt. The feelings would be overwhelming. 
Soup's on!
Bad memories... We'd put our animals together and every house will herd them respectively in our village. The herders were always some kids escorted by adults. But someday one of our neighbours decided that he could do on his own. The weather that day was very bad. And it was spring so there was always a chance of some sheep or cow giving birth.

When I returned home from school I saw my mom sitting by a little lamb and crying. The lamb was trying to get up so hard but she couldn't. She was shaking and falling down. She was trying again and again. It was very hard scene. Our fucked up neighbour thought that the weather would'nt heart the lamb if he just picked her up and hold her. According to him the lamb was in heavy wind and rain for "just 2 hours". No matter what we did we couldn't save her. To this day I still hate that man. Even though he is dead...
For a newborn, that calf is HUGE

The shirt isn't entirely wrong...
It's from Redbubble. I have the exact same shirt.
When I was in India I ran into a pair of teenagers skipping school. One of them had a t-shirt that said, "May they all meet together in heaven" and had pictures of Michael Jackson, Tupac, Kurt Cobain, and fat Eminem. I tried to tell him that Eminem was still alive but something was lost in translation. Ended up buying hash from his brother who was a priest, India is a crazy place.
serenity now! 
"What's the deal with shotguns?" 
I really want this shirt though.
I always find those Seinfeld group PR photos so weird, because they were all obviously taken years after the series ended, when they finally worked out the DVD publishing deal, and they took about a thousand of them all in one day, for every disc and every case and every sleeve of every season, all in the same basic style, totally failing to capture anything specific about what was inside any given box or disc.
You have to admit, Kramer required a certain state of mind.

Where is this? 

Edit: Thank God, I figured out it's in the woods. I was just trying to figure out which state, because I was deer hunting in southern Illinois and had a wild cat scream at me. Everyone said it was a bobcat, but I found it hard to believe that a cat that size could have so much bass in its scream. It was pitch black at 4:30 in the morning. I had a shotgun. Nothing chambered and I have never climbed a tree stand so fast in my life. 
Way fucking cool more like it. 
Holy shit that hog is huge. I'd be surprised if the mountain lion actually went for it.
A mountain lion snuck up on my tent while I was camping alone in Utah a while ago. Creepiest night of my life by far.

Edit: sometime around 2 am, I was woken up by a low moan that had a slightly aggressive tone to it (the moan lasted about 10 seconds). I grew up near mountains and cows and had never heard anything like that before. 

It freaked me out and I went from dead asleep to pulse racing at maximum just about instantly. I sat up and thought and listened for maybe 10 seconds then I flung open the tent and ran for the truck. I was wearing only underwear and the truck was 50ft away. I made it and rolled down the window a bit to look and listen. 

I had no weapons on me.

Total, I camped out there in the same spot for 3 months and this happened about half way through.

Years later, I listened to mountain lion sounds on YouTube and confirmed that it was a lion. He was maybe 20 to 50 ft from my tent and I think he was kindof asking a question. He was curious and wanted to see what I was. I never saw him and never heard him again.
Where was this taken?

I need to know whether or not I need to move.

I work in oil and gas exploration in Canada, i'm surprised this is allowed to exist.  In canada, when we make cuts for seismic line layouts or pipelines, it's is environmentally irresponsible to leave massive straight sightlines like these.  They create what is essentially wildlife highways, and by leaving them straight (we undulate for the sake of the ungulates) you provide long and unobstructed sight lines for preadators (wolves and coyotes).

Oh, it's not for cars.
A three way on a three way.....that's my  dream
Grew up there! It's called the [Tridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tridge_(Midland,_Michigan\)) and there is a park on each side. It crosses the Tidabawassee and Chippewa rivers. One side has the farmers market and the start of a [30 mile bike trail](http://www.traillink.com/trail/pere-marquette-rail-trail.aspx). One side had a huge field with a skate park and playground. The other side has baseball fields, frisbee golf, and a trail leading to the [nature center](http://www.chippewanaturecenter.org/)
Never thought I'd see Midland on Reddit without Dioxin in the title.

2. The tridge
Whoa! Weird seeing Midland on reddit. I've spent many summer nights wandering around this park. 
Truly wasn't expecting to see the Tridge. Proposed to a girl in the center once on a misty warm rainy summer night (she said yes). Those benches in the center aren't even there anymore, so must be an older pic.

One shitty parker can screw up the entire line of cars.  Sometimes, it is not even the guys fault.  SF is famous for narrow parking spaces.  Especially when an SUV parks at a "compact" space.
I love how someone just had that sheet on hand. "I can't WAIT to find a shitty parker to leave this for."
That's a tortoise.
[Why don't they stay between the lines of THEIR OWN GOD DAMN BUSINESS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfHvr1La2LI)
Go easy on the driver.  He might have parkingson's disease. 
As someone named Parker I'm finding it very jarring to see "Shitty Parker" commented over and over again. Honestly it's making me feel little sad guys. 
am I not turtley enough for the turtle club?
Preplanned passive aggression isnt properly passive or properly aggressive.  
Eh, who cares?
I used to be the guy that thought about leaving a note.  Then I saw this comic.
http://spillmybeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-parking-problems-comic-picture.jpg
When I was a kid my dog got really sick and we rushed her to the vet. My dad parked shittily like the guy in your pic because he was in such a hurry to get the dog looked at. The dog died while we were in there and when we left someone had left a note under my dad's wiper saying he was an asshole for parking like that. I never saw my dad look as defeated as he did in that moment.

TL;DR - You never know what someone else is dealing with. I'm getting a beer.
[deleted]
That is clearly a tortoise
Keep in mind, it is not fair to judge someone's parking ability if you don't actually watch them as they are parking. It is pretty likely that the car you are looking at was forced to park like this due to someone else being parked improperly next to them.
In High School, the girl who parked in front of me was 1-2 feet into my spot EVERY FUCKING DAY. I just let it go, but by the end of the year, I was like whatever, I'll leave a funny note. 

"Just so you know  -- (insert drawn picture of a ruler with an arrow pointing at the 12 inch mark)

you were this far into my spot every day this year. 

Best of luck with your future parking endeavors."

She then made a point to yell "asshole" out the window at me whenever she saw me from that point on -- obviously not finding it as funny as I did. 
This is an incredibly passive aggressive way to behave.

I'm not a fan.
I still don't understand why Reddit has such an obsession with people parking their cars badly.

Also, I think it's pretty fucking weird to type up some "clever" memo and put it on a stranger's car.

But, I'm very aware I'm in the minority here.
Where can I find this online so I can print 100 and fulfill my destiny as a passive aggressive parking vigilante?
i dont know whats worse. a shitty parker or someone who puts childish notes on cars that may or may not park shitty.

How much do these menu items cost when compared to similar eateries?
The restaurant is [Zazie](http://www.zaziesf.com/brunch/) in San Francisco, and as you can see from the link, the prices are actually quite reasonable.
This is standard in Australia. We can still tip but the tip jar is near the register and probably need to ask for it.

The incentive for good service is not getting your ass fired while someone else takes you reasonably paying job.
Wow, this thread is amazing-- thanks for the attention, everyone!  My little restaurant is flattered.  Just wanted to give you guys (and particularly the servers/ cooks/ restaurant owners out there) more details on what we're doing and how we do it!

First, it's not simply an increased hourly wage!  In addition to fully funded benefits for EVERY employee, full or part time, and $15/ hour, they all get a portion of the sales.  Waitstaff get 12% of their individual sales (remember, servers used to tip out 6% of their sales, so that's like a guaranteed 18% from every table, including takeout.)  Kitchen & support staff get a percentage of the shift's sales, depending on their roles. 

It's removed the judgement, assumptions, and emotions that living off tips entailed; my servers love that.  And of course I don't take any cash they DO receive; if they do so well that someone wants to reward them extra, more power to them, that's theirs to keep.  And it happens... because my staff is incredible :)  

Come visit us in San Francisco sometime!
Reddit loves a great tipping thread, but what this restaurant is saying is that ALL of their staff (bussers, dishwashers, cooks &amp; servers) are paid a living wage.  Kudos.

Serving is tough, but the kitchen is just as valuable to the dining experience. 
The restaurant that I work at pays minimum wage, we get tipped, but we also get profit sharing. We also get fully funded health, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) with employer match and discounts to climbing gyms and other places to boot. 

I enjoy working there.
Are there any servers here that wouldn't be okay with this? My friend is a server and she says she regular makes $20+ / hour when you average her tips, and closer to $30 if she does that thing that absolutely no servers do - not reporting their tips to the IRS. That is a sweet benefits package I must say, but she's told me she'd quit serving if she ever averaged less than $20 / hr.
Picture of a menu. 
I like the Italian way: no obligation, no forced tips, no shared jar. You liked the service exceptionally? Leave some extra money on the table when you leave. Your waiter will take it completely for himself.
Redditor: "Instead of a tip I have left you with this informative card which expains how the tip system exploits the lower class." <tips fedora> "M'lady."
So basically it's like how restaurants work in the entire rest of the world. USA takes another step forward!
I hate the tip system in the U.S. 

As a black person, whenever I go to a restaurant, they think I won't tip, so they give me poor service. This leads me to want to tip poorly, but I still always give at least 15%. 

I wish tip wasn't part of it and it was just a fixed price.
Sounds better than 

**35% Tip included in Menu Prices**
so 20% markups are already included in the prices.
I just went here! Really good. Really french waitress. 
That's OK. I'll take my tipping position which averages me around 30-35/hr.
Move to Europe 
LOL Zazie is in SF. They're required by law to provide health insurance. It's also a California law to provide Paid Sick Leave. "Living Wage," which is how much exactly? Because SF is fucking expensive and their poverty wage would go pretty far in Sacramento. 
I know I'm in the minority here, but I *like* the practice of tipping. It's one of the few times where I can, unilaterally, decide the value of a good or service **after** getting it. 

At the couple of restaurants where I show up at fairly regularly, I always get excellent service, they remember what I like, and treat me like I'm a valued customer. And I'm not by any means rich nor do I tip more than a pretty typical amount. 

I'd actually be disappointed to have tipping taken out of the equation in a lot of places. 
Define living wage...
This is actually a great restaurant too. Good food, nice wine, neat ambiance. I've taken a few dates here. It's a nice spot if you find yourself in Cole Valley, SF. 
I'm glad we don't have tipping where I live.
The fact remains that, at a flat daily wage, a busy day is worse for a waiter than a slow day.

The tip system, with all its flaws, does achieve one thing. It makes wait staff *want* the place to be bustling. It puts management and employees on the same page, keeping the place as busy as possible is how everybody gets their payday. 

When a waiter gets tips, they see a large party coming through the door and they get excited. When they don't, they see a large party coming through the door and they sigh. More work, same pay.
As a hospitality worker in SF, this is as outrageous as it is hilarious.  They pay their employees $15 an hour, sounds like a lot for other parts of the country, but keep in mind that is set to be our *minimum* wage by 2017 (current minimum wage is $12.25).  Saying that is a livable wage for a restaurant in the Bay Area, nevertheless in SF itself is simply not true.  The total cost of living in San Francisco is 62.6% higher than the U.S. average, and we have the most brutal real estate/rent situation in the country right now (http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2015/06/02/san-franciscos-median-rent-hits-a-ridiculous-4225/)
A tipped position in the Bay Area allows you to make double or more than what they are paying.  Also, while I encourage them to let people know they are providing benefits and doing what ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY, but specifically discouraging any extra gratuities is silly and will hurt service in the long run.  They will lose real talent because competent and hospital servers/bartenders that go above and beyond will leave because working here is basically getting payed what you would at McDonalds.
Tipping culture always confused me when I was younger and I used to visit the US a lot, having grown up in England. Here its basically set up as mentioned in the sign and the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour (although it's set to increase to £9.00 an hour) plus the government will pitch in quite generously in terms of benefits if you're stuck on minimum wage (but waiting staff normally are not, depending on the establishment). Saves a whole lot of hassle when paying though... And if you want to tip on top of that you can: for exemplary service.

Wolf!  Bear!  In ring!  This Saturday!  Siberian boxing!  Much action!  Vodka!
I once eavesdropped on a conversation between two gentlemen discussing a hypothetical match between a lion and a gorilla.  Guy A says a lion would win.  Guy B says, "have you ever been punched in the face by a gorilla?"  Guy A answered , "have you ever been punched in the face by a fucking lion?!"
heck
Those god damn bitches comin' to my neck of the woods and givin' me shit. Need to learn them a lesson.
I was expecting two furries in a street fight. Only slightly disappointed.

Brutal, paws of fury
I don't think contact is actually being made here though. The bear's pretty obviously taking a swipe but it looks like the water is simply flying off its fur, and the wolf is just moving to avoid the blow.

It's a nice action shot but I'm skeptical as hell of OP's title.

The Crown Pub? Was there for St Patrick's Day 2003...beautiful workmanship!
Didn't Anthony Bourdain go here in one episode?
[Spectacular all around, really](http://imgur.com/FbMhgnh)
Called a snug. One of the best things about old Irish pubs.  
[snug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub#Snug)
My local was built in the 14th century. Makes this look shiny and new.
Also has a pretty facade. Although the bar is a tourist trap I've lived on Belfast my whole life and have only been in once.
I love old pubs like this. Liverpool has this beautiful gem, the 115 year old [Philharmonic Dining Rooms](http://beerlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Philharmonic-Dining-Rooms-990.jpg).
Had a few drinks at The Crown a couple years ago. The booths have buttons that call the waitstaff. I think some of them still work, though we were told they get pretty pissed off if you push them. It's also right across the street from that hotel that had the shit bombed out of it in the '60s, which is unfortunate. It's a beautiful place. 
Seems Peaky Blinders did a good job creating this atmosphere for their set. Looks quite similar. 
It looks like the pub in Dishonored.
Reminds me a little of something out of Peaky Blinders.
  
  
  
Such an awesome Netflix show.
  
*EDIT:* Sorry, BBC. Please excuse the American here... I had no idea.
an introverts dreams 
Over priced and always packed. 

Go to Kelly Cellars if you want an old pub; older than the Crown and Wolfe Tone is alleged to have hidden there after the United Irishmen's rebellion
Pretty sure its the only bar owned by the national trust in order to preserve its awesome look!
OK, I'm impressed.  

The craftsmanship is stunning.
it also kicked out nigel farage, the ukip leader who went there on a little publicity drive, that backfired

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/14/crown-bar-belfast-odd-man-out-nigel-farage-ukip
190 year old pub (even if the interior is probably no more than a 100 years old) is relatively modern day. 

Most cities in the British Isles  have pubs with roots well over 500 years old, some which have been a pub going back to the 13th century and beyond. For example the Victoria in Chester 
http://www.visitchester.com/eat-drink-shop/the-victoria-p22431


Having said that, pubs are some of the most fascinating buildings around from a historical perspective, and it's a shame that many of them are going out of business and being pulled down, only to be developed into characterless Tescos and flats etc. Once they're gone they're gone!

It's like the church of drinking.
They never tell you this part, they are called "snugs" and there main purpose was for the women. The men were free to be seen drinking in the main bar area however women could never been seen in a bar (if they were even allowed in in the first place). If they were traversing from the snug to outside they would cover their head with a vale. This pub must of been forwad thinking or in a very build up area as normally there is only one or two snugs in each bar.
You don't see ceilings like that anymore.
wow think of all the privacy while doing cocaine

The sad thing is he probably thought he was making a grand statement but he's had little media coverage and will probably be soon forgotten by the people he had grievances with.
I've been working at the VA since shortly after a lot of the VA scandals hit the headlines. I took employment with them because I was hoping to make a difference. The thing that I find really strange is a significant portion of my co-workers (~70%) have military backgrounds. The vet's that work there are the ones really fucking things up. They are complacent as you could possibly be, and don't give two shits about anything. I honestly, don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror each day.
They would all be fired in the private sector, but because they are vets and work for the VA they will never get let go.
Since this post brings up the topic of the VA and treatment of veterans, I would like to add that the VA and its procedures and rules are run by Congress... If it is your opinion that not enough is being done or more efficiency is needed then please consider your options when your local Congressional elections roll around! It's kind of a shame how little attention is paid to these compared to presidential elections when so much is at stake.
I can relate.

I think I have PTSD.

But it's really complicated. I avoided the VA for a while, because I was told that symptoms can fade over time.

I was in a combat MOS. I deployed to Iraq. We came under mortar/rocket attacks semi regularly, and every now and then had some piddly small arms attacks on patrol.

But.

I feel like a bitch. I know there are countless people who had it much worse than me. I always wonder if what I have is even worthy of being fixed or warrant serious treatment. Deep down I can just hear all the previous soldiers I served with telling me to shut the fuck up, you didn't have it that bad, move on dick.

The realist in me knows the system is overtaxed, and if I were being objective, my concerns probably rank mid to low in the grand scheme of people who are fucked up and need help. They should go first and get help. But it's not like there's some giant line I can stand in and see who really needs help and who is scamming the system. So, I just never know. It takes an already helpless feeling and magnifies it.

I was very nervous to even report it to the VA because of the stigma attached. I already got a confirmation letter and a disability rating for other issues. I applied for the healthcare coverage portion and actually put in a claim for PTSD because it's becoming less and less manageable alone. 

It's been 4 months so far and nothing. No card or letter telling me I can get hearing aids. No appointment for my PTSD claim. Just blank air space.

I feel for all veterans because I know what it's like. Then again, I'm the dumbass that signed up, and I knew exactly (well as best as one can know going in) what I was signing up for in the Infantry.

We're not all heroes, and I know that plenty of bad shit happens to good people in all realms of life. Women get raped, kids get abused, etc etc, and those people didn't ask for anything, and probably get shit on for assistance too.

I don't think I'm extra deserving, or entitled, I just want help.

Spare me the veterans hotline stuff, I appreciate the sentiment. But it doesn't help.

I'm just lost.

If you're a solider going through stuff like this, I wish I could help. I wish there were answers and I wish the system was better. It just sucks. I commiserate, but, welcome to life I guess.

You're not alone, for whatever that is worth.
Why the fuck haven't I heard about this?
There is a difference between not thinking all military personnel are heroes and treating them like shit, which the government does.

 People die waiting on Veteran Affairs waitlists. PTSD is rampant and treatment is clearly not sufficient, the sad part is this all could have been avoided if a diplomatic solution was even considered. 

What happened here was sad and disturbing, it's a clear sign serious change is needed. 
Ah yes, I live near there. I didn't know about it until later, and it was reported he didn't kill himself because of the VA. Must've been a lie. Pretty shocking for a town where the most common crime is a stolen bike or something like that.
[Source](http://www.disabledveterans.org/2016/03/23/photos-surface-from-veteran-suicide-site/)
My grandfather got asbestosis in the Air Force. He got 100% physical disability through the VA. His lung capacity dropped so bad that his oxygen level would drop into the low 80s just walking down the hall. Guy hacks up his lungs daily to clear them enough to breath, and sometimes he goes into coughing fits where his face turns red and he cant breath. His pulse sits at 110 just sitting there, and thats because his lungs are so bad.

The VA took him off oxygen late last year. He was in bad shape until an oxygen machine he ordered from england showed up. Then they cancelled one of his inhalers, and he had to go medicaid to get a replacement. 

The VA doesnt give a fuck.
The way America treats vets is sickining. They send them out to war, make them do their dirty work, and when they get back its basically "thanks, bye now" and considering a vast majority of vets joined up at age 18 to support their families, they arn't qualified for internal non-war time jobs. Plus they get 0 support for the PTSD they have, little finacial support, and little to no educational support. Makes me sick to see homeless vets, vets commiting suicide, and vets that need help (medical or mental) and they can't afford to get it.
22 veteran suicides a day & still not a damn thing changes. One day, I can only hope, these people's actions will not be in vain. 
This is so heartbreaking. Suicide rates are astronomical for vets and I've heard time and time again from vets that the resources are there but they are slow, inaccessible, and that the VA makes you jump through so many hoops to get them. For someone depressed or suffering from PTSD, any hoop can be too many.

News source, for ctrl+f source finders.
'Never Forget' has never rang so hollow.
Well I hope he doped himself up to hell on anesthetic before he did so, because that's a fucking painful way to die.
Yet I turn on the news and see BLM bullshit all over the place
That is the most sad and horrific thing I've seen in my 55 years of life.
We use up our young ones and then throw them away with the constant wars we fight..   
It is time we pull back from being team world police and take care of our own shit.
It is appalling that the 'greatest army in the world' does a piss poor job in taking care of its veterans.

Money enough to equip your army, but no money to help veterans.

Shameful.
As a Veteran, his story is making the rounds through the Veteran channels, heard about it the day it happened.

As a civilian, I ain't seen shit. Let's blow it up.
This is very sad, but it's important to think about why, like others have mentioned, this is getting no media attention. 

I have heard MANY times people saying that they want the news to be more positive and stop focusing on the negative. I so vehemently and fervently disagree that it makes me fucking livid. These people basically want to stick their heads in the sand or sweep shit under the rug so they don't have to 'feel depressed' or sad. People who are cowards and "it's not happening to me or my family so why should I have to hear about it? Show me something that makes me feel good"

If shit like this, suicide, mental illness, child abuse, war and all the horrific shit that happens on a daily basis was broadcast for people to see without hiding it, I guarantee things would be done to actually stop it or fix whatever underlying issue is causing it. Instead very few even hear about it so progress is null or very slow at best, and too many people are ok with this because they don't want to hear about it.

Granted, it's more complicated for whatever other reasons national media is quiet about this and suicide in general, and other horrific shit, but my argument is still valid. News should show all the horrific shit that happens on a daily basis UN-FUCKING-EDITED and if you don't like it then do something to fix it, no sweeping it under the rug. Shut your TV off if you want to be a coward all by yourself.

Like I said there may be other reasons why this isn't televised widely. Govt/military wants to keep it quiet, but the theme of making  the news more positive is something I hear too often that infuriates me, so I decided to rant.





Reading reddit can be intensely depressing, and nothing more so than the disconnect between people's apparent attitudes towards veterans and how society really treats them.

Let's start with the following - if we really supported the troops, we wouldn't be constantly sending them out to die pointlessly.  If the US "supported" the troops, then land invasions would be the absolute last resort.

But I have literally lost track of the number of times in my lifetime that the United States has sent troops out to die in foreign lands.  _None_ of them have worked out well - either for the United States or for the country being invaded.

I mean, the Iraq War killed 5000 troops - more Americans than 9/11 - and crippled about ten times as many - but Americans just really don't seem to care.  None of the politicians who made this decision paid the slightest price - indeed, Dick Cheney made a billion dollars from that "bad" decision, so it clearly worked out for him.  Or on the other side, if you bring up the fact that, say, Hillary Clinton voted to authorize the use of force for that war, and then cheerled it with speeches and further votes for _almost a decade,_ people act puzzled - why are you bringing this up?  

I often see the phrase, "No politician is perfect," when I discuss the involvement of major political figures in these massively-failed military undertakings - as if participating in the decision to cause the deaths of thousands of servicepeople and the crippling of tens of thousands of others is just a little "imperfection" 

Right now on the front page is a picture of a beer decided to the "fallen" troops - I hate that word too, as if they just accidentally slipped and fell over, how sad!, when in fact our "leaders" deliberately put them in harm's way so it was _inevitable_ that many of them would be crippled and killed.

And as we know, so many veterans come back and never successfully get a job, let alone a career, and the same people who sent them out are the same ones who have diminished the power and the opportunity of the American worker to the point that a _career_, a job with the possibility of advancement and benefits, is like the Holy Grail for tens of millions of Americans.

Let me make it very very clear to you - you will not fix this problem by drinking a can of beer with some poor grunt's name on it.  You will fix this problem by electing politicians who promise only to send out the troops as the _last_ resort, not the first.  It is not too late...
The VA is a grade A cluster fuck. There are millions of people backlogged in the system.
That's fucking heartbreaking to me.  

Setting oneself on fire is such a dramatic and horrific way to die it just pains me deeply that he wasn't able to find the help he needed before doing this act.

Words fail me......ugh.

When will we wake up as a species and realize that WE ARE ALL ONE! And start caring for each other as if we were caring for ourselves.

RIP
This is what happens when you let the government handle just a small section of the population. 1%. 

Now let the government get their dirty little hands on Health care. Good luck.

Just put a giant herd of cows there and it'll be a full on jungle in no time.
I imagine terraforming other planets will resemble this someday.
how do seeds find end up at a watering hole like in the middle of such a remote and hostile place, in order to grow these trees

Every year, for that one night, they open up the stones for anyone. You can (and people do) climb all over the stones. 

I spent the night at Stonehenge for summer solstice 7 years ago. There were some Druid rituals - I remember a parade with flaming torches and giant furry animal heads - but mostly people were just there to party. There were drum circles everywhere, some food vendors, and lots of drinking and smoking. 

Unfortunately, it drizzled the whole time, so we didn't get to see the sunrise through the stones. But I was glad the weather forced me to wear wellies, because man, those porta potties grew increasingly biohazardous as the night wore on. 
Edit to change my opinion. Apparently they trash it every year and it's kinda sad. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11455098/Stonehenge-damaged-with-chewing-gum-and-graffiti-during-Winter-Solstice.html
My dad said that when he was a kid in the 60's, stonehenge was just this random thing off the highway, with one tiny little sign, and you just parked on the highway shoulder and walked over to it.  You could climb on it, there was some small graffiti on it, and nobody cared, because there was nobody there.

We went again as a family in 2006, and you had to park in a parking lot far away, pay an entry fee, walk through this long underground tunnel that took you underneath the highway with a bunch of infographics on the walls, then you come to stonehenge and it's all roped off with velvet and you just slowly walk around it in a circle with the group, stopping occasionally to take pictures.
They left that place in ruins.
This is why we can't have nice things.

What a bunch of fucking arseholes.
Funny, they didn't look Druish.
As a janitor, I'm impressed. After that many people this looks pretty tame. 
Is no one in this thread able to realise that most of the 23,000 aren't hippies and are just party-goers?
also, plenty of other people. I mean, if you've got 23,000 people, some subset of them are gonna be assholes no matter what.

You could probably make this title 23,000 gamers, white people and self-stylied atheists and be equally as accurate.
*Shocking* that a group of 23k people left trash on the ground. 20k out of the 23k could have cleaned up all their mess and you're still left with the mess of 3k people. 
>Claims to celebrate and respect the earth

I went to Stonehenge a few years ago and they had a rope fence up about a hundred feet from the stones because people vandalized the stones. 
then people do shit like this, nothing pisses me off more than seeing a place people hold sacred trashed by 23k of the absolute scum of society. 
I think most of them aren't really hippies or druids, just people who like a party.
Gotta love that Hipster hypocrisy ;) 
"But man, we love mother earth! She is so beautiful, lets throw our trash all over it."


You've missed the photo where loads of people stayed behind to clear up. 
This is disgusting.
If anyone's ever been they'll know it's mainly populated by local chavs looking for an excuse to get wrecked. 
Not trying to defend their actions here but I bet if you put a group of 23000 of anybody it would look the same.
I was there for the whole event and I can tell you there were people from all social circles. There were plenty of new-agers and hippies but they were heavily outnumbered by the general public.

The event is part of a religious holiday that's open to anyone and although there were volunteers picking litter, you have to expect some debris from 23,000 people moving in and around the stones.

Otherwise it was an absolutely electric night, people chanting, playing bongos and dancing around the circle into the early hours was amazing to see. I even saw a guy playing a saxophone to one of the stones.
I was there

I am there every year

Loads of local chavs and non hippies turn up to get fucked up and ruin the vibe. Don't blame the hippies because we make up less than half of the people there - after the sunrise all the non-hippies leave and then you'll see what the summer solstice celebrators are really like!
I was there at the 2015 summer Solstice, I was there with my friends just to see what all the hype was about. And as far as I could tell the people doing all the damage was not the druids and people there for the religous ceremony but the people who  were there to get smashed and take drugs in a field. It was basically like Reading Festival Campsite, and if anyone has ever seen a festival campsite after the festival has finished it looks exactly like this.
Japanese druids would never let this happen.

wish I hadn't googled what happened to her and her pet.  From NationalGeographic.com

"From there the story takes a tragic turn. The next month Yoinas mother, Carmen, died after giving birth to her ninth child. The babynamed Grace Kelly at the suggestion of a visiting nurses wifewas adopted by Carmens sister. The aunt also cares for Yoina, who shaved her head in mourning. But the sad events did not stop there. Soon after, Yoinas pet tamarin was killed when it overturned a boiling pot on itself. The family buried it.

When our reporter Emma Marris went to Manú, she sought out Yoina. The girl still lives with her aunt and helps care for baby Grace. On that visit Yoina had less hair but a bit more of a smile, in gratitude for the gift of a photo with her pet."
By Charlie Hamilton James. He writes: Yoina aged nine with her pet saddle-back tamarin. Last year I was shooting an article for National Geographic Magazine on Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon. I had travelled deep into the park to a community called Yomibato, home to indigenous Machiguenga people (aka Matsigenka) as I wanted to look at how Manus indigenous people live within the worlds most bio-diverse national park. Every day Yoina and her friends would walk through our camp on the way to the river to swim. The monkey would come with her, even though it hated swimming. To escape the water the tamarin would always try to get onto Yoinas head, where it felt more secure. Life for Yoina and the tamarin changed dramatically shortly after this image was taken. Their story and the story of Manu features in the June issue of National Geographic Magazine and on the NG website. 

Clearly, that is her dæmon.

Why didn't they just build this over the HUGE parking lots they have? ^Yes ^I ^know ^why, ^cost, ^but ^they ^should ^have ^done ^it ^that ^way ^in ^the ^first ^place
Wtf is across the street?   Those arent trees.

Good on Disney for having a solar farm. :) 
What are those in the bottom left?
S-O-L, A-R-P, A-N-E-L-S
Think they did it on purpose?
What is that in the bottom left?  I thought they were sheep at first, but I have no idea.  Tree farm maybe?  
Drive by this at least 10 times back in January, didn't realize it was a Mickey head. They were still building it a few weeks ago
I can imagine the engineers pitch. We'd like to build you a solar farm... visible from space... *in the shape of Mickey*

I can't find the hidden mickey in this picture
Of course it is. 
Now they're just taking the mickey

Welcome to Narnia.
Italy gets *actual* hot weather in the summer and beautiful snow like this in the winter.

England just gets grey skys and "mild" weather all year round.

Why do I live here :(
It almost looks like there is a light under the snow making it glow
Is Slow Sunrise the name of the town
God is giving a golden shower. Eat the yellow snow, and you shall be given eternal life. 
Reminds me of Totoro's tunnel if it was wintertime. 
This is beautiful! Love it.
It's funny how Italy has more snow than Finland.
Bella... le montagne d'Italia sono una meraviglia.  Cortina l'ampezzo... cielo.  
Lpt don't eat the yellow snow.
Looks unreal. This photo looks straight outta a fairytale pop up book.
I must be going insane. Thought the pictures was moving at first and still wasn't certain after 30 seconds...
Italy gets better sun and snow than us... 
Champagne color scheme 
That must be somewehre near the Alps, am I right?
Oh that's beautiful!
Wow. Thanks for the new wallpaper!
amazing... that's some magical shit.
just awesome
the sunshine and weather is really owsome

Actual information about the drone: http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-tiny-drone-the-us-military-is-testing-2015-6
The carrying case  http://i.imgur.com/OWp5YYb.jpg  They look like the tracking device that was inside Neo in the Matrix.
Everyone knows the first time they use it he's going to flying directly into a ceiling fan, and it will be broken. It's the same story everytime.
Only the first drone produced is $40,000. Each successive drone only costs 1.3 million.
What is this, an attack helicopter for ants?
I need to be a govt. contractor. 
[deleted]
I believe this is called the "PD-100 Black Hornet 2" and was designed by the Norwegian company Prox Dynamics

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7mRg74qcY&feature=youtu.be) of this bitch in action.
A gif of the little thing 

http://static.businessinsider.com/image/556cd32d69bedd3c21964422/image.gifv
>While the device may look like a toy, its certainly not priced like one. The PD-100 Black Hornet 2 prices at about $40,000 for larger orders of the device, said Ole Aguirre, VP of business development for Prox Dynamics. But considering that the Pentagon plans to spend approximately $2.9 billion on unmanned systems for the fiscal year of 2016, according to the Drone Center at Bard College, the $40,000 price tag doesnt seem so significant.

So in other words its a drop in the sieve.
russia is ready: http://imgur.com/a83Ewgc
http://imhur.com/a/a1RHO6s.jpg
I'm just happy that MiMS found a new job.
There's more to that $40,000 package than just the PD-100 Black Hornet 2.  That case hanging off the guys chest houses the display and base station for it.

For what it's worth, it's not a bad little drone.  While it looks low tech it has 3 camera's, has a 2 mile range, can hit 22 mph and has a 25 minute flight time.  Perfect for the types of missions it's designed for, which primarily being spec ops missions, means it's not like they are going to buy so many of these that it dents the nearly $3B unmanned systems budget for next year.

EDIT:  Also worth noting, the British Army has already invested in these, and I believe the Australians have as well.  I also think that the drone itself is cheap and most of the money is in the ruggedized base station and software.  The company advertises the drone itself as "Affordable - reusable and disposable" which leads me to believe that replacing the drone itself is probably something more on the order of one of the CICADA systems drones, far cheaper than $40k.
Should've waiting for the Black Friday deal. No army deals for Turkey day.
This will get buried, but my idiot brother is the one holding the drone in this picture.  When I called him to tell him he made the front page of Reddit and was basically a celebrity, he responded with:  

"...  Cool...  What's Reddit?"
Makes me wonder if they have Drones disguised as bugs now that they using to spy on people with. Hence why the Russians supposedly stop talking when they see a fly in the room.
If the manufacturer sold more than 50 of them, the price probably would be closer to what we'd expect to pay ourselves. 
The Noisy Cricket. "I feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing!"

Edit: Thank you for gilding my first ever comment.
Haha... As much as I hate seeing expensive items on my property books that are cheaper in the civilian side... The prices on those items also reflect the entire package of service, maintenance, updates, repairs... As well as contribute to the contractor support when you need a person to come instruct or provide hands on service. 

Ofc this varies between items, but for items sold to the government a lot of the expenses are passed directly into the govt because they will pay it. If a business provides something they need, the govt can always justify the cost of whatever the business says it had (eg it took me 400,000 dollars to make the tools to make this drone, I need to sell it to you for 40,000 to break even or make money on this since you're buying such a limited number of them) 
You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?
Carbon fiber blades, gold plated axis, 4K live streaming camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, 2-40Hz microphone, ultrasound and infrared sensors, stealth absorption paint, facial recognition software with target auto detect and auto follow, satellite communication, radar jammer, micro laser canyon, stun/freeze ray, not to mention that the contractor, designers and builders need to pass FBI background checks and DoD clearance so it all adds up to US$45,392.13 - Bald Eagle Freedom discount of US$5,392.13 = US$40,000.00. Let freedom reign. 
wow i'm in the wrong business

To be that one kid reading to a dog furiously barking at him. 
Hey, kid. Wanna help me bust outta this joint?
I volunteered at a school where they would bring in therapy dogs and the kids with reading issues could have sessions scheduled by their parents and teacher where they would go an read to the dogs.  It was amazing how much it helped some of those kids just having the dog there.
That's a great idea and beneficial on many levels. 
If someone wants to see the article, here you go:

http://abcnews.go.com/US/kids-practice-reading-shy-shelter-dogs-missouri-humane/story?id=37191962
I'm 44. Can I go read for the puppies and kittens?
What a terrible idea. Those kids are taunting those poor dogs because they can't read.
I hope this becomes commonplace with more school districts.  It helps the kids with learning to read/being comfortable reading aloud.  It also helps the dogs become more accustomed to being around people (especially young children), which will only help with them getting adopted.  Also, as a side benefit, it frees up the staff/volunteers at the shelter to work on other tasks when this is happening.  Such an amazing idea  :).
My professor did a study on shelter dogs and stress. She found that talking to a dog for just 15 minutes a day reduced stress significantly. It was also discovered that the dogs with lower stress levels were adopted quicker because they showed less anti-social behavior. Interesting stuff. These kids could be helping the chances that one of those dogs gets adopted. :)
This is nice. A post about Missouri that isn't obnoxious
That one dog has the vision of destroyed 'homework' all over its face
Oh my gosh, the dog on the right looks like its listening so intently to her story! BRB ovaries exploding
I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog. A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
T-T-T-TODAY, JUNIOR!
It's true what they say. Missouri loves company.
Do other places do this too? This is my first time seeing this and I think it's super cute and beneficial and it should be done everywhere, dammit.
I've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive.
That's a very nice looking shelter.

But now that filthy, germ ridden money is touching your food. 
I traveled to Venezuela this past December.... When I exchanged cash (at black market rates of course) I gave my host about $150 American and was handed a literal trash bag full of bolivars.
"out of toilet paper... need to make a quick run to the ATM"
I have played up to and through Tropico 4, I think I am ideally suited to turn this country around. 
In all seriousness, where could I get a lot of Venezuelan cash in various denominations?  I'm always looking for good-looking currencies to have as money for board games.
[deleted]
So it would literally be more financially viable to wipe your own ass with your cash..?
Ok, I'm gonna need an ELI5 on this.
Used to joke that money was cheaper than toilet paper in Zimbabwe. Got no pics to share for that one though thankfully. 
So they can afford to sponsor an F1 driver who crashes a lot but not sort out their crashing economy, that's clever 
Mmmm! Wrapping your food up in currency that has been circulating through fuck knows how many filthy fingers for fuck knows how long. Sweet!
Can someone explain to me why the economic situation in Venezuela is so terrible? I had no idea this was going on down there. 
Then why do they have napkins, may be they use napkins to buy money
Am I the only one who wants to eat that thing? It looks fucking delicious. 

Anyone know what it is? 
It's not the first or last time this will happen, for me I immediately thought of pictures of the German hyperinflation after ww1. 

I was looking for a specific picture of a guy using a notepad made of money as it was cheaper than buying paper. But alas this will have to do...

This is like Germany all over again. People are going to start burning bundles of money rather than buy wood
I'm a Venezuelan living in Venezuela, AMA! 

lol
Now the really important question: What is it, that you are eating there?
just print some more money, that will surly work.
Also to make that empana it would take you hours to line up outside of a supermarket and buy the basic common ingridients to make it. If you are lucky you can find them on the same day if not just go around each supermarket until you can find it.

I wonder were are the redditors that supported or are still supporting this goverment?
The revolution lives on!
I want to know why tracksuits are so popular among venezuelan and cuban leaders.
ayyy elmío ^^^^^^/r/Vzla 

Ah the paradise of militant anti-US socialism.
Reminds me of pre-WWII Germany and that inflation. Once you get paid, you would actually give your money to your spouse as they hurry to the store to buy groceries before the money lost its value. 

It was also cheaper to burn your money than it was to buy firewood.

I remember being a 4th grader in California and walking out to the playground and having ash falling everywhere. It was one of the most surreal moments of my youth. 
the second photo captures just about everyone's reaction they would have if they just finished a tough climb and the skyline fucking exploded. 
I live in Washington and remember that day well. I was 13 years old. Myself and a friend had ridden our bikes a couple miles from home to go shoot our BB guns. We had gotten to our destination, taken a few shots, and saw some big dark clouds in the distance. Really big. Really dark. It looked like rain clouds so we started racing home trying to beat the downpour that we thought was coming. A couple minutes later the clouds caught up to us and it started snowing. Well, it looked like snow, but it was ash.  We couldn't really see very well by this point and it was getting pretty uncomfortable to breathe. We saw some headlights coming down the road and it was basically pitch dark at this point. The headlights stopped revealing a truck and the driver yelled at us to throw our bikes in the back and he would take us home. I remember we had been reading in school about Hiroshima and nuclear bombs, and I was pretty sure we had been nuked. The driver told us that "Mount St. Helen's just blew up" and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about but hearing the words "blew up" reinforced in my head that this was a nuclear war...or the start of one. Got home and saw the news.

That is how I found out that we have volcanoes in Washington and that I wasn't witnessing the start of World War 3.
"Well, it's a good thing we didn't climb that one today."
I would just like to point out that in these pictures, Mt. St. Helens is 34 miles away. 
There had to have been some type of sonic boom that was out of this world seconds after they noticed the eruption
Even more intense are the [last photos from Robert Landsburg](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/234721-robert-landsburgs-brave-final-shots). 

"When the mountain exploded, he already had his camera on a tripod, aimed and cocked. As the all-engulfing cloud of ash climbed the sky toward him, four miles from the summit, he desperately cranked frames by frames across his lens, then rewound the film into its cassette inside the camera, wrenched the camera from its tripod, and stowed it in his backpack. His wallet was in the backpack too  perhaps to assure future identification.

Seventeen days later, his body was found in the ash, together with the film that cost him his life. It contained not only telling images of the killing edge of the blast but also the scratches, bubbles, warping, and light leaks caused by heat and ash, the very thumbprint of the holocaust."
I lived about 120 miles north, up in Snohomish, when it blew. Most of the ash ended up in Eastern Washington. [It turned day into night over there.](http://ecologicalsociology.blogspot.com/2010/05/it-was-30-years-ago-today.html)

edit: link 
My aunt and uncle struggled through the Great Depression then worked hard their entire lives. Finally they retired and built their dream retirement house on the banks of a river than flows from Mt. Saint Helens. Only a couple of months after moving in the mountain blew and they made it out with their lives with minutes to spare. Lost everything they owned except what they were wearing. Luckily their daughter had married a very rich guy and could take them in. But they never really recovered from the shock and died within a year or two after. 
I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time, and all I remember is that shit just about knocked me out of bed. Incredible BANG that shook the whole house, particularly my bedroom window. 
I hiked around Mt. Saint Helens in 1996, the side of the mountain that exploded was nuts.  There were areas where we were walking across fields of 1/2-inch round pumice that was deeper than you could dig, and then you would walk around a corner and be back in the forest for another few hundred yards, and then you would hit a line and back to the pumice field.  It was probably as close to walking on the moon as you can get without actually walking on the moon.  One of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.
I watched it from our garage door about 30 miles to the upper left of this picture (meadow glade WA). Could never wrap my head around people selling the pens with ash in them...we could have made millions!
Found this guy when reading up about this picture, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Randall_Truman
Any time I see Mt. Saint Helens photos I'm always reminded of Crater Lake (for obvious reasons). The crazy part is that native tribes were in the region when Mt. Mazama blew up to eventually become what we know as [Crater Lake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Crater_lake_oregon.jpg). Mt. Saint Helens was a huge deal even with the geology and volcano knowledge we have today. I can't imagine what had to be racing through their minds when Mt. Mazama erupted.

"Prior to its climactic eruption Mount Mazama had a summit elevation of about 3,700 m (12,000 ft). The present high point is Mount Scott at 2,721 m (8929 ft), 3 km (about 2 mi) east of the caldera rim. Today, the caldera rim ranges in elevation from approximately 2,040 m (6,700 ft) to 2,484 m (8,150 ft)"
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/crater_lake/crater_lake_geo_hist_133.html
whoa. thats terrifying. As a climber, theres always this thought in the back of your mind when you climb a volcano (even a dormant one) that it *could* erupt regardless of how incredibly unlikely that event is. Seeing this must have been a mix of emotions, awe, terror, dread, wonder, and concern for any one effected. 

Also, i'm 100% certain that those climbers were now facing extreme difficulty in returning to Seattle or Portland and were likely in danger from transportation/ash related problems. 
This is incredible. I don't think there's anything else to do at a moment like that except watch in awe.
I was in Seattle when it blew and we all heard it. My dad and I flew from Seattle to California a couple hours later, and they changed our flight plan to go around it. I was a kid and didn't quite get the significance of what I was seeing, but my dad was jumping around in excitement climbing over people to get photos. He was a medical dr but his hobbies were geology and mineral collecting. (the mineral collection he spent his life collecting was donated to the Geology Department at UCLA and is in display cases lining the hallways of the geology building , if anyone is interested. Anyway, I think the guy in the window seat thought my dad was going to climb in his lap 
Would you stand and watch or run like heck
Did they survive?
If you're ever in the area be sure to visit Mt. St. Helens. It's a sight to behold and an experience you'll never forget.
My first thought: "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."
AMA Request: that hiker person
*Told he we should've climed Adams.*
So when is mt. St helens going to erupt again?

It was a very long five miles that year.

This is possible because dinosaurs are only 6000 years old.
It's important to note that this is a cast of the real fossil which has been painted to accentuate the pattern.
Maybe my knowledge regarding fossilization is out of date... But I was under the impression that soft tissues don't fossilize. Moreover, why/how would a fossil retain the assumed countershading as seen on today's reptiles, birds, mammals etc.? Not saying this is a fake... Just not sure about the science here.

If I was an Animorph (damn if I had a dollar for every time I started a sentence that way) this would totally be my bird of prey. Tobias would be so jealous.
I breed and keep some rare birds and raptors, thanks to the arab's love of falconry and all things white, breeding birds like this can fund entire aviaries, this bird is likely worth 100,000$ plus.  
Yes... that is what they used to call me... Goshawk the Grey...

I am Goshawk the White
I want a raptor soooo bad... they are just incredible creatures. How much of a boss would you feel walking through fields hunting with that badboy

Does "neat" mean "hungry for wayward souls" where you are?  Definitely impressive.

I see this a lot driving between Baltimore and Washington DC. There's also the one about Mercury, thanks to the MESSENGER mission by the same lab. I still find it funny.

Guy on the far left is Ralph Semmel, director of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and next to him is Alan Stern, head of the New Horizons program at NASA.
I have a buddy who was the flight software engineer for LCROSS and his bumper sticker is "My Other Vehicle Crashed Into The Moon".

And they're already obsolete.  That speedy little fucker is on its way out of the solar system.  They need a new one:  "My other vehicle is on its way to the Kuiper Belt."
Seriously, nothing inspires me more than seeing a devoted group of scientists who are literally bursting with glee at the success of a huge mission they've worked on for years. It's kind of awesome. They deserve as much recognition as we can give them.

How can we make a shirt controversy out of this? The last one saved so many lives.
Oh yay, horrible office humor for when you're in traffic. 
Isnt that old woman a senator?
The registration fee on that thing must be astronomical.
Pluto is great and all, but I'm looking forward to all the Uranus bumper stickers.

"NASA: Uranus is next!"

"NASA: Probing Uranus since 2042!"

"NASA: We went to Uranus and all you got was this lousy bumper sticker."
Is that Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD)?  She's the best.  Talk about someone who doesn't take shit from anybody.
Senator Mickulski isn't on the New Horizon team
That's not a NASA employee, it's Senator Barbara Mikulski from Maryland.
Lol nice
Being the kind of people I know they must be to work on such a team, you know they all debated on the proper way to refer to the craft in terms of motor vehicles. "Car" would be more catchy, while "vehicle" is more accurate. Obviously they went with the one that was most technically descriptive and correct.
And my job officially seems insignificant. 
the old lady looks like the old man on pawn stars.
Is that Barbara Mikulski?
That's my senator! Love Senator Barb!
Barbara Mikulski FTW. Go Maryland.

Side Note from a structural engineer who does a lot of natural and manufactured stone work:

I sure as hell hope that wall was designed to take the load and the rocks are supported to the lathe well.  Otherwise that thing is going to last 5-10 years tops.
What exactly is used to hold the rocks in place...a certain kind of cement?
In the boy scouts, they would warn us against using river rocks for our fire pit. I was told they can explode.
This is by [Michael Eckerman](http://www.eckermanstudios.com/), [Here](https://www.pinterest.com/stacycats36/michael-eckerman-stone/) is some more of his stone work.
The idea and execution are both really great, but the scale isn't good. It really overwhelms the house instead of fitting in and seeming like a part of it. Same thing but smaller would have been perfect.
ITT: People who know about river rocks but not about fireplace/chimney construction. River rock is often used for fireplace surrounds and is easily found at many local landscape and decor specialty stores. The stones are not used directly in the fireplace where the heat is the highest. In addition, many stones are properly dried before being sold. 

They aren't wrong saying you shouldn't use river rock when making a camping fire. But, in this application, river rocks are completely fine and make for an aesthetically pleasing fireplace. 
It doesn't really matter what kind of stone it is as far as resisting heat.

Unless this was built some place that is completely wild west as far as building codes, this isn't a chimney and fireplace that is solely stone. There is a fireplace made out of fire brick and a specific heat resistant mortar. 

That feeds up into a smoke shelf which will be masonary and on top of that will be clay liners, wrapped in four inch block all the way up. There will also be four inch block providing the rectangular shape to lay the stone up to.

To sum it up: There is a clay liner that's an inch or more thick, a four inch block, at least an inch or two of space, then the four inch block exterior shell, another inch or two between the shell and the stone.

These stone are at least almost a foot away (with close to nine inches of heat resistant material in between) from any of that heat being produced in the fireplace and moving up and out through the chimney.
and now there is a river with no rocks 
I admire the amount of technical skill and time put into this, but I think it looks really tacky. 
Nice idea, but the design make nauseous. I need order, sorry.
Former mason laborer here - by far the funnest job I worked on was a huge entire house of irregular stone like this.  Basically it was a 2-month-long scavenger hunt, running from skid to skid looking for the right stone for the right spot.  Took longer and the rocks were harder to lift, but man it was a nice break from the monotony of brick-work.  And looked awesome when we were done!
Nope. Sorry but it reminds me of the picture of the ticks in a dog's ear. I can't unsee that picture when I look at this chimney. 
I saw a picture once of a deer with hundreds of ticks in a group stuck to it and it looks like this fire place
looks amazing but how long do these actually last? the mortar will give way to weather and the rocks will fall out of place eventually
i wonder what there is to stop rain from just falling right down and into your house.
Looks like a hidden environmental puzzle from The Witness.
These curves bother me. I like things that are square. 
I would be climbing that, in my childhood.
Goddamn that's beautiful. 
That chimney is a work of art.
Well that mustve been a labor of love cause that thing took forever...
Amazing chimney!!!

Mortar?  Any specific type and/or thickness/depth?

Nice work!!!

Switzerland man, the place is like fucking Rivendell. 
For anybody curious:  This was taken on the cablecar ascent from Stechelberg to Mürren.  [The cablecar route](http://i.imgur.com/qflpIJf.jpg) continues upwards to the summit of Schilthorn, and gains more than 2 km (1.25 miles) of altitude in about 30 minutes, including a single leg which ascends more than 1km (~0.6 miles).

As you near the top of Schilthorn it looks like a [Bond Villain's lair](http://i.imgur.com/zIKzJCd.jpg), because it actually is.  The building at the top, Piz Gloria, was featured in the James Bond film, _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_.  There's a small museum.

One of the greatest things about living in Switzerland, though the flag is a big plus as well.
I passed through the Alps on the way to a holiday in Italy when I was a small child. I remember we stopped off in a cafe which had a huge glass wall at the front and I had a lovely glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. I remember being completely in awe of the scenery that was in front of me.

I remember that stop off in a cafe so clearly yet hardly remember a thing about the actual holiday.
As much as I love looking at this picture, I must also clench my buttcheeks in fear of a terrible landslide sweeping away the entire area.

I was watching the same meteor shower on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.  Everyone else was either sleeping or partying, so I had the top deck to myself.  I laid back and wrapped a towel around my face to cut out any artificial light, and just had the most amazing time. I saw one big fireball that just took my breath away. 

When I returned home, I saw this picture on Reddit. I wondered if it was the same fireball. I thought maybe the photographer and I shared the same moment, he in the beautiful cold wilderness of Canada, and me out in the warm waters of the Caribbean, both of us staring out into the starlit blackness. Then suddenly a streak of multicolored fire races across the sky. 
Where is this?
*sighs* can someone fetch the Doctor? There's a rip in the fabric of the universe again.
Now *THAT'S* a fireball!  Lucky as hell shot!
I've actually seen something like this. I was walking outside talking to a friend on my phone. It was 22:30. Winter, maybe 2 or 3 of January. and really dark. There were no street lights I walked on a gravel road. All of a sudden. I could see everything around me. I saw a group of deers on a field. At first I thought a helicopter or something light everything up with a beam or whatever. Then I looked up and it looked like a huge scar in the night sky. It was incredibly bright, and it grew really fast. After which it stopped and slowly faded away. Probably something you only see once in a lifetime. 
[Be careful' I've  seen something like this before](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/en.futurama/images/a/a6/Anomaly.png/revision/latest?cb=20090616164244)
So I'm just gonna ask because it bothers me.. If I stand there at that time and take a picture with my phone, or just look at it.. Is not gonna look that cool. Apart from editing, what is the camera doing to make it cooler than my quick and easy phone picture is capable of?

I agree OP.Skyrim mods sure are beautiful.

The real breathtaking thing is when you see a meteor/shooting star so close by that you can hear it breaking up.

This happened to me in Fargo a few years ago. It was casting shadows in my yard, then a few seconds later I heard a warble and some crunching noises. I couldn't believe it.
HhhhhEEEHHhhhh GIVE IT BACK I CAN'T BREF
This is insane (to me) that this is on the front page. I saw something very similar as I was walking to the bar ~2 hours ago. I thought it was a shooting star at first, the it got HUGE and blue. Then there was a white burst of light, a second burst of light, and then it disappeared. It all happened so fast.
Throw a wolf on that pic and you've got a best selling tshirt at Walmart!
We were driving home from Edmonton to Calgary and saw this streak by. It was amazing to see. Glad I was looking out the window at the time or we would have missed it. So cool

I'd always planned to setup a selective breeding program with the intention of making micro-elephants. The long lifespan/gestation period of the target animal has always been the elephant in the room in regards to my plan (would take centuries to achieve a meaningful redux in size).

Little known fact, if you feed elephants lots of cheese that slows down their metabolism slightly and can, in very extreme cases, lead to dwarfism. The cheese can do this due to the way the enzymes in the cheese react with the elephants special type of stomach acid.

I chose the older design of Toronto Police that was used until about 2006 or so (longer on supervisor cars) because it worked better for my advertising. Had it checked out with police before going forward with this and was told it was perfectly legit. Used company colours of white black and grey. NEVER GOT PULLED OVER AND NEVER GOT HASSLED ANYWHERE IN CANADA OR THE US - NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES AT THE BORDER EITHER! For those who are wondering how we get anything done with this car - have you seen a crown vic's trunk? For all smaller to medium jobs we have no problem getting anything we need. Can fit a 17' combination little giant ladder in the trunk. For larger jobs we use a minivan.

We live in the same town, small world.
There are so many fucking cars like this now in the GTA, it drives me insane. Pro-Weed cars, Ticket Fighting cars, so forth.
hahahahaha. In my town it's illegal to paint your car up to resemble police cars.

Mostly because of the fight your traffic ticket companies abusing it.

A friend of mine from high school bought an all black Crown Vic with the rambar still installed. It scared the absolute shit out of people in the school parking lot when he came up behind them. 
This used to be an RCMP cruiser that was brought over from Nova Scotia. Have ahd it for 5 yrs. To the guy with the suggestion it should be to protect and seal I beg to differ. To paint and protect is synonymous with to serve and protect and has double meaning. We work mostly in Toronto and west GTA. For those who's business we'd lose solely based on this - I wouldn't want your business anyway.There's thousands of painters in the GTA. I like dealing with easy going people and will gladly leave your business to the other painting companies. We are not impersonating anyone as it is pretty obvious and it's jusy that split of a second, if someone finds that offensive,  I feel sorry for you.

It was in the early to mid 1990s in Riverside California. I was standing outside of a backyard party ($3 at the gate). I think the Voodoo Glow Skulls or the Assorted Jelly Beans or Schlong or some other stupidly-named band was going to play. 

So I was outside I was,  waiting for some friends when from down the street came a slow moving car with a search light. Pandemonium broke out because the party was about to be busted. Shouts of "five-oh! five-oh!" were heard. People took off in every direction. They jumped over the back fences. I even heard someone tried to put the keg in the washing machine. 

So I'm out there and I'm afraid of nothing because I'm straight and I don't have pockets full of marijuana or speed. 

Slowly, slowly, the car comes up shining the spotlight.

When it gets to the house, out leans the most Shaggy from Scooby Doo looking stoner who proclaims, "OH! THIS IS WHERE THE PARTY'S AT!" and then he parked and a party was had.

Brave soul, getting dumped on by big shore pound like that fucking hurts!
"So what do you do for a living?"

"Oh I take photos of waves before they fucking destroy me"
I grew up swimming in the Pacific Ocean, that force that pulls you out to sea and builds this wave is ridiculous! And when a wave like that hits you dead on it feels like a train and it can smash you into the bottom of the sea instantly.

Some of the best memories I had growing up were in the ocean. Some of the worst memories I had were also in the ocean. 
Looks like the waves in Japanese paintings

As a surfer, I can say with accuracy that he's going to have a bad time.
Clark Little is the friendliest dude! I lived down the street from him in Haleiwa, and could watch him "play" in the waves for hours when I spotted him at Waimea or Sunset. The waves crash so hard, this dude has balls of steel.

[Shore breaks](https://youtu.be/EUXOZAinUPk)  
Other interesting facts about shore breaks.  
EDIT: Being from Hawaii I've thankfully learned how to duck dive under any wave, especially shorebreaks. As the name of the wave suggests, a shore break is a wave that breaks obviously close to shore. In my years of living in Hawaii I've probably seen a dozen of deaths because they either don't duck dive and get slammed from the peak down towards the sand or worse, rocks and reef. Another reason people die is that they stand at the bottom of the peak and get slammed with pounds of water causing back injuries or worse paralysis. It is fun to bodyboard or bodysurf these types of waves, however do it at your own risk. Learn to duck dive, never be afraid of a wave again.

This post incited me to look up heterochromia on wikipedia - it turns out that I've got central heterochromia. I'm also less proud of it now than I would have liked to be:  
  
"Though multiple causes have been posited, the scientific consensus is that inbreeding is the primary reason behind heterochromia." - Wikipedia entry for heterochromia  
  
Much disappointment.  
  
[Edit: Upon watching my significant other slowly back away when I relayed this comment, it occurred to me that it might be wise to add that (a) the suggested inbreeding could have taken place anywhere between a heterochrome and mitochondrial eve, and that (b) it's scientific *consensus,* not documented *fact*]
My Aussie Puppy has this mutation too.

Look at the size of that bunker!
mmm yea dats 500g and 2 happiness tyvm
In the morning mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond Kingsport. White and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds, full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And later, in still summer rains on the steep roofs of poets, the clouds scatter bits of those dreams, that men shall not live without rumour of old, strange secrets, and wonders that planets tell planets alone in the night. When tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliffs rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faery.

Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious, terrace on terrace, till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a grey frozen wind-cloud. Alone it is, a bleak point jutting in limitless space, for there the coast turns sharp where the great Miskatonic pours out of the plains past Arkham, bringing woodland legends and little quaint memories of New Englands hills. The sea-folk in Kingsport look up at that cliff as other sea-folk look up at the pole-star, and time the nights watches by the way it hides or shews the Great Bear, Cassiopeia, and the Dragon. Among them it is one with the firmament, and truly, it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun. Some of the cliffs they love, as that whose grotesque profile they call Father Neptune, or that whose pillared steps they term The Causeway; but this one they fear because it is so near the sky. The Portuguese sailors coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see it, and the old Yankees believe it would be much graver matter than death to climb it, if indeed that were possible. Nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the small-paned windows.

Good old Minnesota nice. 
I can excuse the grammar errors because of such an outstanding response. *And* a letter was printed and mailed to you. That's great  customer service. 
This just goes to show that you should never not respond to bad service because you think "they won't do anything"
What kind of car do you drive? Replacing a cabin air filter is not worth anything a dealership will make you pay. One of the easiest things to maintain in your car
At my oil change place they charged $20 for the filter and did a free install.
You've made a nice return on that written complaint.
Luther Bloomington? Damn I went to Walser.

Also, wheres the Minnesota karma train?
It's not *price gouging*. I think you should probably look that phrase up. It's just a price that was out of touch with the market, and then corrected. 
/r/HAILLocalbusiness?
As someone who works at a car dealership: Wow
My sister recently bought a 2007 Honda CRV, took it in for an oil change and they suggested replacing the cabin air filter because it was "extremely dirty." She was surprised and asked the mechanic if they replaced it yet. He said they hadn't but they could do it for 55 bucks. She asked if he could show her the dirty air filter that's in her car first. He was hesitant but she insisted on seeing the filter. They walk over to the car and from behind the glove box the mechanic removes a pristine air filter. To which my sister says, "Will you look at that, that air filter that I replaced last week still looks new." The mechanic apologized and said someone must have marked the paper work incorrectly or was thinking of a different car.  Sure they did...
[deleted]
>indicated that *are* price point...

This glaring error upsets me more than it should. 
My car wouldn't start. So I took it to my Ford dealership because I had 150$ credit. They said it was my battery. I paid 100$ for it because it had a long ass warranty and I was like fuck it. Next day it didn't start again. They said it was my alternator and it would cost 700$. I told them that is insane and hung up. They called back and said they talked to their manager and took 5% off. I laughed and hung up.

I installed the alternator myself for total of 120$ and 30Min to an hour of work. This being my first time looking at youtube videos.

Turns out that wasn't it.

I took it to a mom and pop shop and they fixed it in 4ish hours (dropped it off before work)for 100$ total and said the air condition was drawing power.

The Ford dealership makes money on commission. My theory was they were going to claim it was the alternator and charge me 200-300% overcharge and then fix the air conditioning problem and claim it was the alternator.

Fuck those crooks.
Not bad. At the dealership I get my car serviced at they tried to hit me up for $1,900 in bullshit. All I needed was a 25k mile service. I thought out loud and asked him "are you fucking serious?". I could see the terror in his eyes and that's worth more than any gift card.
Now come get your air filter so we can sell you something else and charge you up on labor to make up for the gift cards.
Wow!  That's a pretty great decision on their end.  I'd do business with them.  
Cabin air filters are like $10 and can be changed in like 5 minutes.  Save $40-60 and do it yourself.
Kia is kinda getting their shit together over the past few years 
Nice try Luther Automotive Group!
Wow, grammar is *not* that dude's strong point.
Of course this is from a Minnesota dealership, we pride ourselves on being too nice.
Omg, the typos...
That are price point.
And...? Am missing something or is this one of the most boring and pointless posts ever?

[Heres a map of all the Volcanoes Around the World and it makes it look like they should rename Chile to Volcano-land] (http://alien-homepage.de/volcano/world_volcano_map-all%20volcanoes.jpg)
Is [this monstrosity](http://i.imgur.com/q4nMnqK.jpg) the same cloud from the photo? That thing is like 200km long.
[This article](http://www.weather.com/news/news/chile-calbuco-volcano-eruption-evacuations-alerts) on the Weather Channel has more pictures and info. 

-first eruption in 42 years (1972)
-1500 people evacuated from nearby Ensenada
-it is considered a "sparsely populated area"
-it is not the only volcano currently spewing hell vomit in Chile at the moment

Best of luck to those nearby!

A few questions,

-What are people supposed to do when you live this close to an active volcano? 

-Does the media play a positive or negative part when something like this happens?

-Can lava melt steel beams?
Anyone want a quick volcanology lesson? Heres how this type of eruption works. Inside the mountain is a magma chamber, filled with liquid magma under pressure. In this magma are gasses dissolved inside it. Think of it like a bottle of soda, when you look at the liquid, it's just liquid; but when you release the pressure, the gasses come out and bubble up out the liquid. Same principle in this type of volcano. When the pressure gets too high in the chamber an eruption begins and the gasses in the magma are released out of the magma just like in the soda bottle. But the gasses also bring with it some magma that is quickly solidified into particles as the gas escapes, this is the volcanic ash. So the huge cloud you see is a combination of volcanic gasses and particulate magma known as ash, and at very high temperatures non the less. As the pressure in the magma chamber comes down the eruption slows down, and when the pressure has been relieved the eruption ends. Not a volcanologist, so this info is my synthesis of a complicated process from when I wanted to learn how this worked one day, and is a very basic explanation.

It's annoyed me for a long time how no-one ever seems to take high-res pictures of volcanic eruptions. I just want a desktop background, is that too much to ask?

For anyone curious, these tombs were carved by the same people who carved Petra, ie the place in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was filmed.  Petra is in Jordan pretty easy to visit ([here's me last March!](http://imgur.com/fbYjQ6q)), and is safe to visit even in the current Middle Eastern climate, but these tombs just across the border are *really* hard to visit.  That's because tourism visas don't exist in Saudi Arabia, and what's more you need a permit to travel up to this region to see the tombs, and the Saudis are not really willing to grant them because these tombs are pre-Islam.

So if you want to see stuff like this, go to Petra- you won't regret it, I promise!

The part that really made me sad was how much litter there was; even in the most remote of places. I would see plastic bags wedged between rocks and garbage just dumped along the side of the road.

He's lying guys, it was like Flyschwitz in there. - escaped firefly

Fox did something similar.
I was taking my dog for a walk the other day, and this is his first full summer so he really hasn't seen fireflies I don't think. Anyways, one flashed in front of him, so he did what he normally does and snapped it up and ate it. Well, it should be said that he is a pretty drooly little boy, and you could actually see bits of glowing firefly in his drool. It was disgusting, but kind of cool looking.
I made an animated version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4o1nbw/lightning_bugs_fireflies_time_lapse_my_backyard/

You would not believe your eyes 
Hey everyone, I should clarify, this is 6 images taken at 30sec each at ISO 3200 at f2.8 and merged using "starstax" which I usually used for startrail shots. There was about 6 to 8 firelfies in the jar total. I am a little surprised myself at this final image.
It blows my mind a little every time I'm reminded that fireflies/lightningbugs are a real thing that exists in the world. It's like finding out Santa is real.
I sat out on the back porch this past weekend for a little bit and watched the lightning bugs flair in the dark. It was a lot more relaxing than I would have imagined. Also, that's a lot of fuggin' bugs in that jar, man. 
How did you collect them?
3 minutes? What was your ISO at? It's so noisy it looks like the ISO would be jacked up which (let alone the 3 minute exposure) would blow everything out, right? How is this just not a white image?
Not a streak or blur in 3 minutes? Are you sure you didn't just stack your timelapse exposures?
When my grandfather was a kid, him and his friends would catch a bunch of fire flies in brown paper bags, then go to the local "picture show" and release them so there were fire flies all up in the movie theater.
Very cool, wish we had fireflies in Florida
The noise in the picture makes it look like a quick render in blender.
Beautiful!! 
I've never seen a firefly. Crap.

I like that you mentioned that you let them go afterwards. Many (most?) people don't think that tiny lives are worth saving and it's nice to see you be like "Don't worry, they're ok!"

Any idea how many were in the jar? I can't decide if that's a shitton of fireflies or if it was just a few who were moving around a whole lot.
I feel terrible about the wiffle bat genocide I inflicted on these little guys when I was a kid.  I don't kill bugs anymore (on purpose), but somebody should have smacked the shit out of me for that.

Stealth - 11/10 

IGN
I *just* finished two hours of reading about the development of the stealth bomber.  TIL:  That a scale model was made with the functional RCS technique and placed atop a $186,000 pole to make it high enough to fire radar at it.  When the radar returned only a blip for the pole, the operator sent guys to put the plane back on top, as it has clearly fallen off.  It had not.  

BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ALL 'MURICA. 

Unsatisfied, apparently, with seeing the blip of the pole...they ordered the design and construction of *a new pole made with stealth capabilities.*  They made an effin stealth *pole.*  No info on how many workers died running into it while setting it up.

Bonus TIL:  1)Stealth bombers were the first planes ever designed by a team lead by the electrical engineer.  2)When designing the shape of the plane, they created software to test for the desired effect on radar systems.  They were unable to even consider panels that were curved, as the the computers running the test algorithms would still be working on the results *today,* which is why they are flat.  This design and the total lack of traditional aerodynamics led to it being nicknamed Hopeless Diamond.  
This could have so easily been photo shopped and I wouldn't even be mad if it was.
Where was this taken?

What lens and exposure time would you need for something like this? And would the iso need to be fast or slow because I've tried astro photography with a 50mm f 1.8 lens at 400iso and 3200iso and didn't really see any decent results that was at 30 sec to 2 min exposure time.

What's cool about this gif is you can kind of estimate how high the station is. Like, it's about 40 to 60 times higher than the clouds, and about 3 or 4 times higher than the beginning if the atmosphere. I wonder if I'm correct (if any body likes doing the math)

With hundreds of people running out of gas on the highway trying to flee I feel like this may have been the wiser choice.
Currently trapped north of Fort McMurray, riding it out in camp. Highways are buggered, and there's no gas to be had, save for random touring tanker trucks. 

Hopefully it clears up a bit in the next little while, I would like to get out of here...

Update: Made it out, and with a whole bunch of other people. They're getting everyone out, and working hard it. Much love to anyone still stuck up there, and thanks to all who sent their love. 
Fire fighters from Ontario and Quebec have been flying in fire fighters to help. For those who don't know, that's a distance of  4000km/2485miles, or about the distance between the UK and Saudi Arabia.

88,000 people evacuated. Zero injuries. Zero fatalities. Zero instances of looting. Canada is fucking awesome.
Can anyone explain what triggered these fires? It's only May in Canada...
This photo is incredible. The lighting, the sense of urgency and escape, the motion, the juxtaposition of horses with a city building in the background... even the blurring is making it more real. And the casual nature of what she's wearing, it just highlights the spontaneity of what she has to do and how brave she is, and even adds to the feeling that she has a natural bond with her horses. The fact that she's riding the first horse and the others are following suit gives the impression that they trust her and she's such a badass just running them all to safety.

This is such a tragic situation for so many families and animals, and it all feels really helpless, so seeing this "commanding" looking picture feels almost exciting in a way. Like you're so rooting for her.

Anyway. I like the picture. I hope they're all okay.
This has me wondering, the loss of human life is zero right now but what about pets/livestock? 

Keeping my fingers crossed for everyone out there.
This is cool as fuck...not the fires, but the camaraderie she has with her horses and the cunning escape they're making.
Is it me or does "Fort McMurray, Canada" sound funny without specifying "Alberta".

Looks like a fence in an area near an ocean.  The white stuff could be salt.  Perhaps it is in bands like this because it had condensed dew droplets that, as they dried, were periodically exposed to a salt breeze, causing salt to precipitate at the thin edge of each evaporating drop.  Each band is a record of the edge of liquid water as it evaporates?  Know anybody with an electron microscope?

It looks like that because the fence was galvanized.  I have seen patterns on steel that look like snowflakes, etc, similar to this nice pic you posted. So when they galvanized the fence, they dip it in some hot cleaning solutions and then molten zinc.  That's the pattern you seen reflected now when the steel get wet or frosty.

This may sound obvious, but if you see something like that happening, don't go near it. There's other people in this thread who said that, but I'm not sure if everyone knows the reason why. It's not just because the person telling you to stay away thinks you're stupid and going to accidentally touch the line. Being near the line can kill you, you don't have to actually touch the line to die. 

An energized wire on the ground causes something called "step potential". Basically, the voltage in the ground is high near the wire, and decreases the farther away from the wire you get. If your feet are apart, the voltage between your feet can cause a current to travel through your body. Maybe it'll injure you, maybe it'll kill you. If you need to get away from something like this, shuffle away with your feet together. They used to tell us you could also hop with your feet together, but I guess they don't trust us not fall over, because that would also probably kill you. 

tl;dr: Just being near a burning wire like this can kill you, even without actually touching it.
[Who wants a body massage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3GTNv9hHk)
It's the Sha from WoW! Except real!
I have had the experience of watching a high voltage line fall to the ground and arc several times after a rain storm. I was about 200' away when it fell. The sound, heat, and brilliant light was truly a thing to behold. The sound is a tortured and macabre screed in the most evil tone you've ever heard. The heat and light are incredibly intense. Unfortunately the sound drew my eyes directly to the fireball and it left an after image the persisted for several minutes. 

These underground vault fires are something special too. I have watched an attempt to put these out before. As I recall, it took this massive truck pumping insane quantities of CO2 into the vault to chill it before anyone could enter. 

http://youtu.be/0_jLmAB3leA
Real Question: Shouldn't this wire be insulated?
Shocking
Fractals. Crazy how they pop up over and over.
Lineman here, can confirm, stay away. People,  voltage won't kill you, amperage will. The resistance of the ground changes everywhere, that's the reason for the lighting bolt pattern. What's cool is that along where the wire was on the ground (directly beneath the wire) it'll make crude glass, which looks pretty bad ass. 
Safety: NEVER touch a down wire. We are protected by step/touch potential by rubber over shoes gloves and sleeves, even then we still verify that the wire is de-energized before we touch it. Keep in mind de-energized does not mean that it's safe to touch. Had a worker bump a line with his leg that was down and de-energized but not properly grounded, didn't have his boots on because they were In a marsh and he got killed. Induced voltage from another line. If a wire is on the ground think of it as a bear or wolf, you get to close and it's going to maim and more often than not kill you... 

TL/DR: Never touch a wire on the ground, fear that shit like it's got a gun to your head. 
That's fracted up.

They should have a booze basket for adults.

In Sweden its a common practice at most stores. It is almost only bananas since some customers decide to take one banana of the cluster. No one then picks the single banana and the store have to throw it away. 
This is a standard in Sweden, I haven't been to one supermarket which does not offer free fruit for children.
In Seattle it was extremely common for supermarkets to allow/encourage kids to have a free piece of fruit while they were shopping with an adult. 

Now I live in a small town in Canada and our tiny grocery store offers a huge free chocolate chip cookie at the cake and pastry decorating counter.  To hell with healthy-- mmm cookies!

Is this Woolworths in Australia or Countdown in New Zealand? (They use the same logos)

either way this just wouldnt work in most areas in the states

I'm probably gonna get hated for this, but I think it's photoshopped and that it's not OP's pic
Thank you for stopping
And you arrived at work 4 hours later with an average speed of 3 mph after being cut off no less than 17 times by people who don't use turn signals...
Outstanding photograph. I can tell you took this from one of the mountains from the west, and with a large telescopic lens, with Treasure Island to the left.

This is going to sound pretty pretentious, but I have been hard pressed to find an emotionally stirring photograph of the Golden Gate since a traumatizing experience I had there last year. I may just have to save this one.

Well done!
Thank you, I love seeing amazing pictures like this when I'm stuck in Australia

Reminds me of the black cat I had growing up. Parents got her a few days after I was born. She looked just like this and lived to be 24 years old. She was an odd cat, but wonderful. Cats in general still amaze me because their domesticated form is just so close in behavior to the larger breeds that it is amazing. 

There is still a part of me that wants to believe I could have a giant cat as a pet. I know it's not true, it's cruel. I'd never partake in such a thing *but still* I want one, dammit. 

I don't know, after growing up around cats it is so hard to believe the big cats are hunted outside of the realm of self-preservation if you are attacked. They're just such beautiful animals with amazing quirks in their behavior and "personality." 
How could anyone, at anytime, in any universe shoot an animal as beautiful as that?

I had a similar situation growing up in an old farmhouse. Only my window had bats in it. I was surprisingly not freaked out by it. sometimes I would tap the glass to make sure they were still alive. They'd wiggle around and I went back to ignoring them. Never opened that window in the 10 years I lived there, but small price for having bats for roommates I guess.
Cool.  So, she built her nest in between the screen and the window?  How did she get up in there?  Was there a curtain or something up against the window?  It seems like she'd feel kind of exposed...
You can see where they keep their nuts
That's really cute! (altough I heard that in some parts of the US squirrels are more pests than cute animals)
You should've had him live stream 24/7 the squirrel nest. I would've done it. I think it's amazing!
She probably chose that spot because of  the warmth radiating from the window. 
That's adorable. Would love it if you kept us posted with progress pics.
There was a squirrel that used to climb to the edge of a branch and look through my window and make noises at me while I tried to sleep. I don't know how to make that sentence seem like I'm not crazy.
Charge admission to your new "zoo"
It's like an ant farm, but with rodents.
I saved a squirrel baby a couple months ago. I found him barely breathing and the mom dead right next to him. Took me 9 days to find a shelter, lazy but at the same time wanted to see him recuperate before I brought him there. I don't trust paws and other entities like them. 

Edit: tried to leave him in my backyard when he was walking again, no squirrel adopted him but now the squirrels in the neighborhood will come up to my porch and take nuts out of my hand.

Double edit: not necessarily lazy just took me a few days to find a place then get time, took 2 hours to drive there. Also, thanks so much for the gold. Nerve thought that would've happened in my life.

Wow, how big are these squirrels? They look humongous!
*How much is that squirrel in the window?  How much is that squirrel for sale?*
Aww so cute even when they look like the rats that they are. Surprises like that are a terrific part of life. I had a dove make a nest in the saddle bag of my bicycle stored on my porch, and so for several months I literally had an inside view to the whole egg laying, chicks hatching, mama feeding, and babies leaving the nest. It was a once in a lifetime experience. 
I hope your friends have children because this would be fascinating for kids.
Now *this* is /r/mildlyinteresting, not that typical shit they post.
Do that mama a solid and take some hand warmers too the window or something

Edit: leaving the mistakes but fuck autocorrect. And bless coke and whiskey. 
This is the coolest ever! I'd love to watch this every day! :)
I'd like a live Webcam to be pointed at this. Or at least a gif.
That's either a really small window, or one FREAKING HUGE squirrel!
Looks like a nest of Zuuls.  Ghostbusters needed.
That squirrel has little pink aliens on it. 
Fuck that's cute.  Why is it that all I get are hideous wasps.  One pane away from destroying everything good in my life?

2. That's clearly a pool ball.

Some cats are just super tolerant and some aren't. One of our cats actually gets into bed every night and sleeps between us like she's people. It was a little weird to wake up one night and see her head just popping out.

If we ever find ourselves in a post-apocalyptic Mad Max scenario, I have no doubt we could build small towns on those things and ride them across barren landscapes, searching for water. Kevin Costner would be our glorious leader.
And here we see a mama dump truck and her young eager offspring following closely behind.

Size just sounds funny, sorry. 
That truck has a haul capacity of 290 tonnes. I'm having trouble putting that into perspective but it could haul about 160 cars or about 650 wheelbarrows of rock, each wheelbarrow carrying around 442kg or 974lbs. 
Oh thank you for the memories. My Dad used to drive one of those when he worked at Cortez Gold Mine in Nevada.

So serious question.  With hindsight I'm thinking the Syrian revolution was a big mistake.  As bad as they thought it was under Assad, this shit would have never happened if the country wasn't weakened from all of this.   Amirite? 

Americans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.  But I think in many cases a revolution just replaces the current bad players with a possible set of worse players. 

I'd love to see a history of overthrown governments and whether the common people were better or worse off after it.

https://localwiki.org/hsl/Camp_Topridge


Now that's what I'm Tolkien about.
Honestly, I think that's just a boat house. Or a boat house with a guest cabin. 
Also known as the Adirondack Architectural style. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Architecture 
[I knew i'd seen this house somewhere before - Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO6BgrnXcA&t=14m48s)
House of Cirdan, the Shipwright.
That woodwork is on point
de_lake
That's a boathouse, not a "private marina".
Looks like the Adirondacks.
This definitely reminds me of the one of the inns in WoW. It's been years so I don't remember its name but it was in the level 10ish+ area near Darnassus.

Edit: I believe it is Auberdine that I am thinking of.
But would you live there rent free if you had to give up Facebook? 
[Let me set the mood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yLjsWTNeE)
If my hunt-and-seek games have taught me anything, there's a hidden microfiche in that house, and the boathouse has a spear, a starfish, a watering can, an umbrella, a mirror compact, a kitten, a  fish hook, three scarves, a TV remote, a flowered headband, a baby's rattle, and two pieces of a torn up photo in it.
Honest question. What happens if the water level rose/dropped say 5-10 feet? I don't know about this area but around here thats pretty common throughout the year. Does the house float up to compensate? Is nothing kept on the lower level with the dock and they just let that flood? What if it rises over that level? Just curious if anyone knows.
I work in this area often. This is Camp Topbridge on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondack Park of NY State. 
I turned in a quest there once where I had to kill 10 diseased boars.
This is no mansion, it's a boathouse. Also a marina is a yacht mooring or harbor, this is probably suitable for a very small uncovered powerboat at most and, more likely, serves primarily to house paddle boats of various kinds.
Oh to have money...
I see the house in When Marnie Was There.

Believe it or not, I remember visiting that Honest Injun Trading Store with my family as a kid in the late 60s. The Smoky Mountains was our pilgrimage from Florida every summer.
This is awesome, but I am wondering what is so interesting about this scene that compelled you both to take the same shot ha. 
499 Tsalagi Rd - Cherokee, NC for anyone who wants the Google Street View.  Photo probably taken from outside the Welcome Center, near the painted bear statue.
I think that is very cool. Good job to you both. 
OP, I grew up out there. Down the road just at the outside of town is what looks like a small park area, across from that is the small reservation. (its not a res it's actually a land trust, but still)

That's where I spent a portion of my first years.
I wonder if that CHAIR LIFT sign on the right was for the lift up to the Ghost Town in Maggie Valley. We used to stop around Cherokee/MV all the time driving from Chicago to Charlotte.
The trees really have grown and they finally put in that crosswalk paint.
Is that an injun store? Wow times change lol
It's kind of interesting that the picture from 1971 looks better/is more in focus than the 2005 picture.
Griswold family's cross-country drive.
Western North Carolina is a great place to live in my opinion. 
Minivans were so much cooler back then.
Are there subreddits where people post older photos of scenes from different eras?  Even seemingly insignificant scenes like this are interesting to see in a different time.
There's a coolness to these photos that I can't explain.

Something about different generations seeing the same places and the changes they've gone through, both the people and the places.

Living history or something like that, anyway, cool pictures, thanks for posting.
I immediately dug up Rambo "first blood" when I saw this post 
I'm in Cherokee for the next few days. I will have to find this spot and take a picture
Just down the street this was filmed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm3B82Q5vhY
It's interesting to think that the town was likely wealthier and healthier back in 1971. 
I literally freaked out over this. We went camping near there almost every weekend as a kid. So I clicked the picture. I spotted out our station wagon in the top pic. I showed my brother the picture. He instantly saw my parents, who are now passed away, in the picture. THANK YOU! Still freaked out....
Awesome! Share over at /r/thewaywewere.
Went to the Smoky Mountains for our honeymoon and stayed in Cherokee!
That Chair Lift store survived to 2005
I've shopped there before. I love cherokee. Great lodging and activity.
Working on getting you guys a 2015 for you collection. Cherokee is cleaner and has a lot of new signs, however the big land slide in The Park really hurt the local businesses. Many are gone for good. 
Cars sure were long back then.

"There's a storm approaching from the Northeast that brings a chance of rain and utter devastation for thousands of years. More at 6."
Can you imagine living if the earth was the size of Jupiter? Just travelling to the other side would take months with current technology.

Edit: Welp okay maybe not months as stated by /u/jsmooth7

Yeah and the red spot next to it is a storm, which has been there long before your grandparents were born.
And still Jupiter (plus the rest of the planets) would fit lined up between the earth and moon. 
You're so silly North America! Get down from there!
Who would have thought it's about the same shape as North America on Earth?
I bet you'd still start on the same f%!&ing continent as the Aztecs and get steamrolled by turn 100.

Yeah but hundreds and maybe even thousands of people would die if you put it there.
Honestly that's bigger than I thought 
I really wish Earth was that big. Ignoring all of the physics and what would actually happen, exploring would hold an entirely different meaning on a planet that size.
No need to travel billion kilometers for this comparison.         https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BXqKkYYALMU
[Here is what the moon would look like replaced by Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNlLnaJiGY8)
We get it. America vapes.
It's interesting to think of Earth being that big. There would be so many countries and so much war probably. Like even now with our tiny planet we can't get along and when you compare some countries and their views with one another they can be total opposites. Like just 2,000 miles from me, or a 5 hour flight, are countries where women can't vote or are allowed to do basic things, or places where young children have to work all day for a couple of dollars whereas mine can just go to school and then come home and watch Netflix. If that 2,000 was suddenly 200,000 who knows how different different areas of the planet could be. There could be a war 5x the scale of WW2 going on in one area on the planet and then on another area they could be oblivious to it.

Just kinda crazy. 
So much room for activities!
Not for long.  It's pretty close to that big ass storm that's gonna break it into a trillion pieces.  
Thank god that  banana is there for scale.
On a side note Jupiter is flat.

I've posted about this before, but I used to work for a company that manufactures underwater speakers. We had one customer buy our speaker so he could play music into water, then bottle and sell it with its new musical properties. 
meh ... always better to go for the naturally vortexed water  - it has more essential edddies and fewer artificial swirls.
Hell, at least you know what's in it. I looked at a packet of chili seasoning earlier and it said: *chili powder, other spices, garlic.* That's fucking helpful.
So they stirred it with a magnet?

Edit: guys, guys GUYS!!!!! I know what a lab magnet is and how its used. Please stop explaining it to me. Please? Pretty please????
I used to work at a Whole Foods. One of my regular customers would instruct me to key in the UPC on every item, because running it over the laser scanner would "lower the energy levels."

I'm a chemist in this industry, and I've seen some shit, but this is seriously impressive. Hydroessential rose isn't a thing, that's just a term they made up. Rose water is the byproduct of steam distillation.. it's called a hydrosol.. as for the top part, that is the fanciest way I have ever heard a stir bar described.

Here is what is actually happening: they buy in bulk from an import company for a couple bucks a pound, dump it into these bottles, stick that crazy marketing on it, and mark it up 10,000%

It works too.
Rose water: $3.99

Vortexed and Magnetzied Rose Water: $25.99

"... So, it's hot?"

"What?"

"Well, I mean, in the case of water, a 'higher vibration' would just be heat."

"No, no, it's energy, see?"

"Energy is just motion within a medium. Take electricity, for instance: That's just electrons vibrating."

"I see your confusion. This water has been vortexed and magnetized, though!"

Here is what to do if you find yourself with this dangerous liquid! 

**Ramos Rose**

* 2oz dry gin

* 1oz cream

* 1 egg white

* 1/2oz lemon juice

* 1/2oz lime juice

* 1/2oz of simple syrup

* 1 dash of rose water

Dry shake with a whisker, then add ice and shake again till chilled. Pour in a glass with ice and top up with club soda.
At least they can't actually say that it *has* any benefits, they can just say that they *believe* it does. If you're dumb enough to buy that, then you deserve to pay more for bullshit
My wife has this stuff. It smells really good on my underballs.
   You need to vibrate higher so you can capture the opening portal that connects this earth of 3D with one earth of 4D or 5D.
Does it contain any tachyons?

You got rid of Big Buck Hunter??!?!
How much did you spend?

It's odd when you stumble across a place you recognize IRL on reddit. 
I'm friends with your neighbor and have seen that view many times.

 I was wondering who bought that place. Great job on the renovation!
Did a girl move in?
So is there an Eames chair hiding behind the Eames footrest?
That is one amazing maximization of living space. Way to open it up. Looks fantastic.
Love the stairs. Where did you get them?

My guess is that your local building code won't accept the open nature of the stairs on one side -- because of the possibility of falls.
Some Feeney cable rail would look great on those stairs for the right side handrail. http://www.feeneyinc.com/
Not the cheapest but really nice. 
I like everything but the new couch. The old one looks so damn comfy
What's upstairs? 
It's like...you became an adult. 
Nice! Do anything professionally or is this from YouTube learning?
Went from a cool place to hang out at to a place you have to hold your farts in for long uncomfortable periods of time.
Replacing that stair case was money well spent. I feel like the right wall needs to be red or some other accent color. Great renovation.
What an incredible transformation! What part do you like best about your new place? Also, what kind of set up do you have? A studio? Or is it something more?
Thats a pretty neat carpet design whered you find it?
You people are crazy, or all in on a joke or something. 

Dirty carpet, ugly furniture, old ugly kitchen cabinets, cramped kitchen, all fixed and improved. Very good job, OP.
I love the new stairs.  It really opened up the space.
I'm surprised by how many people prefer the before. The only thing that I would see as a downgrade is the couch. On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Even though I'm only in my early-30s, plenty of Redditors are younger than that. The before reminds me of my first apartment, the second reminds me of what I upgraded into. So well done OP, welcome to adult-hood. Young redditors, you'll be there soon.

* The stairs, way less of a visual strain.
* I'll take hardwood over carpet, every day of the fucking week.
* Opening up the kitchen pass-through into the dining-area is great.
* Using ceiling mounted lighting over the dining area table instead of a floor mounted is great as well. 
* That arcade took up too much space for the area (IMO), good job placing it elsewhere. 
* Many other improvements
Looks great. I like how you swapped out the laminate for some foot friendly carpet. The gaming arcade and well stocked central bar are also nice touches! Very 80's.
It is amazing

what throwing out old beer cans

can do for value.
Based on the lighting, I'd say there's a window behind where the picture was taken.

It makes those binoculars on the table seem a little bit creepy.
I can totally picture myself falling off those stairs... face first.

Looks like you went from age 23 to 33.

You must be level 61 or higher to enter the lair of Crawmerax the Invincible
Crawfish
The Reapers are coming.
This is amazing. I am high. 
He's keeping all of that metal for himself?  Pretty shellfish if you ask me.
Heh. I like your imagination, kid.
There are times, you find, a lobster in a bucket... can't climb out.

The area is grazed by goats/sheep instead of mowing.  Too many unexploded rounds and mines still there.

It's a national park in France.  The woods nearby have guns 1/2 into trees and helmets embeded in wood.

Fun fact, the French government allows tax relief to shepherds who voluntarily provide and maintain sheep on plots of land that are believed to have a number of undetonated mines. The idea is that without putting human lives at risk, sheep can detonate landmines over time while the owner of the sheep is compensated for the possibility of losing said sheep
It is absolutely mind boggling the scales of WW1 and WW2. I have traveled around much of Europe and South East Asia, retracing troop movements and big battles. Some of the places seem like it just took place in the past decade. The sheer size of these wars are just simply unimaginable. 
Reminds me of the final episode of Blackadder :'-(
That is beautiful, but also quite eye opening.  I imagine you could spend an afternoon digging around in there, and you are pretty much guaranteed to find some soil.
Ah yes, the trenches of Beaumont-Hamel. The 1st Royal Newfoundland Regiment's probably more well known battles. July 1st, 9:15am, of the 780 men, all from the 1RNR involved in the 3rd wave of attacks (all attacks before completely failed), only 110 survived, and only 68 were available for roll call next morning. This picture is just East of the Caribou Memorial for the 1RNR. By the looks of the craters this was a German trench because a week before the charge, the Allies bombarded the German line with artillery and mortar. Unfortunately it did not weaken their defenses.
[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont-Hamel_Newfoundland_Memorial) is the story of this trench.
Some scars never heal completely
[deleted]
Were the trenches originally straight and they have eroded over time, or were they dug like that? 
If the landmines are all gone, that would be one hell of a playground.
Considering the fronts weren't moving much and it was essentially feeding meat into a grinder from both sides ... just imagine how many people died in that picture alone over those 4 years. :/
[Welcome to the lovely Cercen Pass.]  (http://i.imgur.com/mLSXLBt.jpg)  Where you can still find many remnants of the oft-forgotten Frozen War of the Alps.

The Italians established many gun positions and camps [on mountaintops like these.](http://i.imgur.com/JSCO29y.jpg)

The Austria efforts were equally Sisyphean.  [On Marmolada, the highest mountain in the Dolomites,](http://i.imgur.com/n88KSic.jpg) the Austrian Corps of Engineers built an entire "ice city"a complex of tunnels, dormitories, and [storerooms dug out of the bowels of the glacier.](http://i.imgur.com/Iu2H7gM.jpg)  Only to lose it to the Italians.  Who in turn lost it the next winter to the combined Austrian/German forces.  
In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

.

We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie

In Flanders fields.


.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.
Imagine if the Grand Canyon was originally a trench for giants
And every hole is where an artillery shell hit, its really astonishing to look at Verdun and other sections of north-eastern France and Belgium.

Fun fact, their still digging up undetonated land mines, shells and grenades from that area (The red zone i think its called) so about 102 years of cleaning.
Australians died there. Motherfucking Australians from the other side of the damn world. 
This might be a good time to mention The Great War on YouTube is covering WW1 week by week as it was 100 years ago with added bonus videos.

And no I don't work for them it's really that good.
There's a BBC documentary called "The First World War From Above"  that's currently on US Netflix (and, apparently, [also on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8C_CIdmk8)) that does a great job of exploring the scars that the trenches and battles of WWI left on Europe. Well worth a watch.
to put the First world war into perspective, there is a 1 foot thick layer of iron stained soil which stretches across parts of France and Belgium which is entirely composed of shrapnel and debris from the war. 

the trenches, shell craters and structures may erode away, but the layer of war will remain for millennia below the surface. 
Pictures from WWI continue to amaze me and instill a sense of humbleness and pride (being Canadian, and all). I have been fortunate enough to visit Vimy Ridge and the surrounding area twice. The first time the monument was being restored, so thankfully I was able to go again a couple years ago. It was a great experience, and I highly suggest anyone go if you get the chance. From what I remember, the tours at Vimy Ridge are free; you just sign up for a time when you get there. I also suggest renting a car and just driving all over. You will stumble upon many different WWI and WWII sites that are must-sees. Can't wait to go back!

Even though this will be buried, if anyone is interested in seeing pictures, feel free to ask.
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools, singing at night,

And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,

Would scarcely know that we were gone.

- Sara Teasdale
Well how do you do now, you Willie MacBride?
Do you mind if I sit down beside your graveside
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun?
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done 

Well I see by your gravestone you was only nineteen
When you joined the great fallen of nineteen sixteen
Well I hope you died well and I hope you died clean
Or Willie MacBride was it low and obscene? 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Did you leave a young wife or a sweetheart behind?
In some faithful heart are your memories enshrined?
For although you died back in nineteen sixteen
In that faithful heart you're forever nineteen 

Or are you a stranger without even a name
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane
In an old photograph tor, battered and stained
Faded to yellow with brown leather frayed?


Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

As the sun beats down on the green fields of France
There's a soft summer breeze makes the red poppies dance
And see how the sun shines from under the clouds
There's no gas, there's no barbed wire, no guns firing now 

Oh but here in this grave yard it's still no man's land
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
And through man's blind indifference to his fellow man
To a whole generation who were butchered and damned 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Now Willie MacBride, I can't help wonder why
All those that lie here now why did they die?
And did they believe when they answered the call
Did they really believe tat this war could end wars? 

Oh the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain
The killing and dying, 'twas all done in vain
For, Willie MacBride, oh it happened again
And again and again and again and again 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest?

Salvador Dali (of the Melting Clocks fame) owned an Ocelot named *Babou* (which is probably where Archer gets the reference):

I was with my parents one day in Miami when my mom pointed out the window into the harbor.  "Wow, look at that big boat!"

I looked and saw a yacht, maybe 80 feet long.  I was like, "Yeah, that boat is pretty big I guess."

That's when I noticed the big building behind the boat was moving.

That was my job for 4 years or so. Living on a ship changes you. (It's not all the glitz and glam you think!)
I was on this ship a week ago... It was incredible
"Show me which Iceberg touched you, Son."
For the love of Triton, please tell me that has enough life boats.
So much space for so many noro viruses.
I spent two months on Allure when it still being built in Turku, Finland.  I "technically" helped build it by putting in the point of sale workstations throughout the ship (there are literally over 300 POS terminals on that ship).  I had an AWESOME outside cabin, and made the crossing from Turku to Miami.  I hooked up with a nice voluptuous girl from Wales (great body, bad teeth) and got very drunk very often.  We even had a kickass Halloween for all the contractors.

But after seeing how the crew lives, there's no way in hell I'd live on that thing.  Three months was more than enough time for it to get old, even with all the amenities.  That being said, the food was amazing, the shows were amazing, the Steiners were amazing (those are the insanely hot "spa chicks") and the bars (there are 17 on the ship) were kickass.  We tested them all (luxury of being a POS guy).

RCCL is a great company.  They're NOTHING like Carnival.
 Can't wait to see Titanic II make her trip from Southampton to New York in 2016. Best of Luck to Mr. Palmer, Hope it all goes off without a hitch, I'll see you in NY.
It is the twin of Oasis of the Seas. Both same size... largest cruise ships in world.

TOOT, TOOT MOTHERFUCKER!
That... that is a big ship.
but...the bridge?
Took a cruise on this beast two years ago. I felt like i was on the Enterprise. Very nice. 
Alright, guys.  For real this time.  This boat is unsinkable.  
Creepy. 
The size difference is always impressive, but those ocean liners from 1900-40 or so were just so damn sleek and beautiful. Cruise ships are just so ugly by comparison. 

I miss me some genuine ocean liners.
But the real question  is how did they conquer that bridge?
I have a sudden, new respect for the Titanic now.
how big would a wave have to be in order to tip this thing? would it ever be in any danger to this type of event?

with that being said, looks like a ton of fun to be on.
The Titanic wouldn't have sunk if it rammed the iceberg head on.
Now we need a bigger iceberg.

Someone was going to do it.
There needs to be a new Star Trek TV series as classy as TNG was. It is almost painful looking at pictures of the current TNG cast, knowing nothing like it is on TV today.
Patrick Stewart is probably thinking "not this shit [again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QIsHQfKZ4g)"
Levar Burton looks like he doesn't have time for that shit.
Be still my goddam heart. Deanna Troi you are still the goddess of my wasted youth. 
What the hell is on Michael Dorn's finger...?
I love everyone's reactions, but absolute favorite thing about this picture is the "Brent Spiner is unimpressed" look.
[Damn, that's a really good facepalm](http://i.imgur.com/reg5O.gif)
Engaged.
Frakes, Burton, Spiner, & Dorn talked about this during their Q&A panel later that day. Frakes was talking about how confused they all were before he proposed then they all had that "ah" moment. They said it was one of the things they'll remember most about the con. The couple was in the panel and they had them stand up to get applause from 1000 people. Pretty cool.
What's the deal with Levar's and Brent's glasses holders? 
Sir Patrick Stewart facepalm a young couple in love?!?
How DARE you.
Look at the retraction in the muscles around his mouth and the slight upward curvature of his lips. THAT man, is about to cry for romance.
While he weeps for them, I shall weep for you. 
Burton and Spiner giving zero fucks.
Honestly Wils face is better than the facepalm.

Amazing you even *saw* it.
My SO and I rescured a baby turtle last summer from a bike path, and we kept him! Turns out he was a dormant egg from the previous year and was in rough shape when we found him. His eye was all swollen shut. We actually put him in a small water hole the first time we saw him, then next weekend we found him in the same spot, that's when we brought him home. Named him "One Eye'd Willie", but he goes by Willie now, or sometimes Will dog.

Here he is climbing!

What is that, a turtle for ants? 
I'm so sad today. I'm going to tell a horrible story.

I work as a mail carrier, and today I saw this HUGE turtle in the road, on a fairly busy road actually. So I put my mail in my bag and go to rescue him, all of the cars were changing lanes to avoid him (it was a two lane one way). I go in to grab him, and this white car comes up and isn't paying attention. He's texting and he doesn't change lanes.

I was one foot away from my turtle friend when he hits him going 45. Ruining my big little friend. He didn't die, but his body was torn in half and his shell was crushed. He lifted his head in agony and my heart broke. I'm a 25 year old man and I cried while I stood there. I couldn't save my friend from his fate.

Another car comes down within a minute or two and finishes him off. This time I was relieved he was no longer in pain.

I've seen it all, but today was a especially bad day.
Definitely post that here too: https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyanimalsonfingers

PSA: When you find a turtle on the road always help it in the direction it's going even if there's a pond behind them. They're going in that direction for a reason. 
My boyfriend is obsessed with what he refers to as "Wee turtles" 

When he saw this, he made the most adorable noises, so thank you for that, OP. 
Awww! My boyfriend saw [this little guy](http://imgur.com/PnxuC9c) in the road a few weeks ago. I was surprised he was able to see it, and yours is even littler! I'm impressed 
Wash your hands.  Small turtles have been implicated in a few salmonella outbreaks by the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-03-12/index.html).
The turtle isnt even that big.  I just have freakishly huge hands.

We found a little guy like that in our pool last summer (or maybe the year before). Now he's got a nice aquarium in our house. He's grown a little bigger than the palm of my hand.
Baby eastern turtle?

Where do you even start to deal with that?
This picture is from Lancaster, NY. 
You're going to miss out on a chance to dunk?
For anyone who may not know, Buffalo NY and the areas just south of the city are getting absolutely pummeled with lake effect snow. Some places, like Lancaster, where this was taken, have over five feet (at my house we have three). This all happened overnight. The I-90 is closed here (and there are tons of vehicles stranded on it), there's a travel and driving ban in the effected towns, and a state of emergency has been declared, at least in the county where I live. And it's not expected to taper off until Wednesday at the soonest. 
Also my snowblower broke this morning pls pray for me whilst I go shovel for the rest of my life 
Edit: saw OP is from Lancaster 
Good ol' Lake Effect
Jeez, where was this taken?
Go Bills

EDIT: Thanks for the gold!
It's always nice to stay in bed with that kind of weather =o. Just like with rain. Oh that melancholy.
You better shoot some three-point hoops to bring in the heat!
When I worked in the snow removal business we had drifts similar to these but at least 30 ft. tall.  Normally its not worth the time, energy, or fuel to even attempt removing drifts like this but they were blocking fire exits on an entire side of a 400,000 sq. ft. warehouse.  Me and the (only) other guy ended up being there for the next couple days, only taking meal breaks and sleeping for a few hours in my jeep (temp. was at least -10 degrees F).  That sucked balls.  Fuck iowa.
I'm just going to assume OP lives around Buffalo because I lived there for the last four winters and, yah, I'm pretty glad to be in Virginia for this one.

I proceeded to read down the comments, and was incredibly surprised to see that no one was freaking the fuck out over the fact that your postman entered your house. I came to the conclusion that you were in some amazing part of Europe (likely Norway or Sweden) where people are just that awesome.


Fast forward 32 seconds to now, while I sit here in my idiotic realization, typing this comment.
I hid my package between some pillows once.

I got a lot out of it, but she seemed sort of ambivalent.  
"Day one and the pillows suspect nothing."
THOSE! AREN'T! PILLOWS!
What package?
the left pillow looks photoshopped and its really bothering me
[Yes, sir!](http://imgur.com/22nQ18L)
I too remember hiding my package with pillows when I was a bit younger.
Plot twist.  The package was, in fact, a hideous pillow.
The Internet has ruined me to the point of thinking you just signed for the package, had the idea, executed it and took the picture. Nothing is fun anymore.
Why the fuck was he in your house?
Brother, nuts. Good job on the Front Page.
Why does american postal services just leave packages where ppl can just take them? Why dont they just leave a note and ask them to collect at the nearest post office or call to reschedule delivery?
expertly hidden in plain site, genius. 
My mail guy hid my package at the USPS shop. A package that was small enough to go in my mailbox. Fuck USPS.
Cushions man, not pillows.
Wife got a new pillow for the porch. ...seems legit.

As a geologist who got their start with finding this variety of fossil...holy crap man...hang onto that one.

No, you're supposed to put it on your face and it turns you into a hero with cartoon powers. 
Reminds me of a short story called "Swap Shop" by Nicholas Fisk.

Kids find a hole in a wall that whatever you put in swaps out for an alien version of the thing. All of these alien things have a small device set in them, a small spiraling worm thing, that will start slowly spinning when the item is broken, and repair it as if by magic.

Eventually one of the kids squeezes through the hole to see what's on the other side, and is returned hairless, with unnaturally smooth porcelain white skin, small slit mouth, no nose, and eyes that are worm spirals.
The truth is out there.

[Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_Caverns_National_Park)
Carlsbad Caverns! I was there few weekends ago. Make sure you head over to White Sands if you're down in southern New Mexico, too.
It's all downhill. Can you just let the wheelchair roll and see how fast It can go?
Excuse me, where is the non-handicapped stairway?

I DEMAND TO BE TREATED EQUALLY
It's gonna be a long journey back up though
Bye grandma! Hope you have fun in HELL!!
Where's my longboard? I'm going down this
Growing up in Carlsbad I've been to that pit on many occasions, seen the thousands of bats fly out of the cave in the evening on  a  few summer nights and even worked at one of the worst tourist trap restaurants in America, The Velvet Garter in White's City, a few miles from the Caverns a few summers in college back in the day.  If you're planning on visiting the Caverns one day, I recommend it but keep driving past White's City if you are looking for a place to stay or eat, you will thank me, I promise:)
Yep that's Carlsbad. From that angle you can't tell but it goes down farther into the darkness than that. Those are amazing caves if you ever get the chance to visit.
When you roll long into an abyss the abyss also rolls into you.
Oh you should be there at sunset: about 60 kajillion bats fly out of it:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a2/60/e4/a260e44c57aad36e4fac932eed2f9015.jpg

You've got it backwards. The terrifying pit into the abyss is not wheelchair accessible. The surface world is wheelchair accessible.
["worry not fragile one"](http://pbfcomics.com/270)
I volunteered at Carlsbad for 5 weeks 10+ years ago  through the student conservation association. 

Fun facts:

* visitors are only allowed to walk down the natural entrance, they have to take the elevator up  (rangers/volunteers walk against the flow, so to meet more people)
* there are lots of formations that they don't tell you about; like a ll the "lint-ites":  lint from people's clothes that get stuck on the formations.  volunteers come in the summer to clean the cave. (with hoses and tweezers)
* it's 59 degrees and 90% humidity downstairs, while it can be 95 degrees and really dry upstairs
* the best lighted formation in the cave is not labelled.  it's  to the left of the elevator in the big room, it's called the "virgin of guadelupe" (rangers are not allowed to point it out)
* it takes 90 years for something to grow as big as the tip of your pinky (from the last knuckle to the tip).  They know this because a passage was created between two rooms for a tour, and the stalactites growing on the ceiling of that new man-made passage (in 1920; well; now almost 100 years old) are that large. (for the kings-queens tour)
* lighting was done by professional stage /theater lighters.  Lighting for cave pictures is *really hard*.  if you go, I recommend just buying the post cards.

[Speaking of a wheelchair accessible pit into the abyss...](http://i.imgur.com/6ghcdDq.jpg)
I remember this place for all the wrong reasons.

Our family took a 3 week long road trip around America and we stopped here. It was myself, Mom and Dad, and 4 other brothers. 3 of my brothers went ahead while my other brother (call him Brett) stayed with me  (still ahead of my parents). I was 10 at the time and I just remember Brett wandering in a small circle in the middle of the path looking up at the top. I called out his name, he collapsed and I immediately ran and got my parents. People passing by offered and hand while I ran and got help from paramedics.My dad and Brett went back up while my mom and I continued downward (she physically couldn't walk back up the ramp). Terrified and concernced, we continued on the path with some of the darkest blackness we'd ever experienced trying to find my other 3 brothers. long story short, we find a ranger after a wn hour or so, describe my brothers to her and guides us to the bottom. Thankfully my brother recovered and we continued on our trip with just a 1 day delay.

TL;DR: On vacation here brother collapsed from a seizure and we lost 3 of my brothers in the cavern
Was there last weekend. Can confirm, there was a guy who almost ran over my toes with a motorized wheelchair 750 ft below ground. Probably took the elevator though.

http://i.imgur.com/KqouyEU.jpg
The second last corner towards the bottom isn't wide enough. 
*motorized* wheelchair accessible
The disabled are welcome in the abyss
I grew up in Carlsbad so I know that pit well.  I still remember being around 3 or 4, way to old to get away with this, and suckering my aunt into carrying me down into that pit:)  She was the best and must have know I was being a little bastard but never complained

Well, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[We're all seeing this, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEC_lkpD3rM)
Satan reeeeally got tired of everyone complaining the only way down to the next level of hell was to fall down a cliff, the demons had to spend more time sorting out the bad people from those who got curious and too close to the edge.
thats not for wheelchairs, its so the giant snake can get out

On your way home from where? Hiding bodies?

Cus it get cold like Minnesota.
It's a lovely picture, but a little editing would really help bring it out.  Some noise reduction, especially in the shadows, would help clean up the tones and a little bump in contrast and clarity would help it pop.

[I gave it a little play in photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/YWPZVHE.jpg) - mainly what I said and also straightening the lines up a little.    There wasn't a whole lot I could do with the low-res JPEG.  

Editing is a very important part of the photographic process.  Getting the image as correct as possible in camera is great, but editing is almost always needed to tidy it up.  

Another little tip, is that print you've had done on canvas?  Get it printed on good quality semi-gloss paper and framed (even a really cheap, basic frame) and it'll do the image the justice it deserves.  You could probably get it printed on decent paper for $10-15, and a frame like [this](http://www.therange.co.uk/fashion-black-box-frame//the-range/fcp-product/51577) - with the photo either window-mounted or at least with a white border between the image and frame.  

It's a great photo and definitely worthy of a little extra work so you can really showcase it on your wall!

Beekeeper here. This is a great example showing why honey bees die after stinging something only once. Their stinger/venom sac are attached to other organs inside the bee, so when the stinger's barbs lodge into something, everything gets pulled out, potentially including gut, etc and leaving a gaping hole in the bees abdomen.

Another interesting fact: the stinger that gets left behind is composed of the stinger/barb, the venom sac, a layer of muscle tissue surrounding the venom sac and a nerve ganglion attached to the muscle. Independent of the bee, that nerve ganglion continues to contract the muscle around the venom sac, pumping more and more venom into the victim even if the bee has run off.  This is why when you get stung by a bee, you want to scrape the stinger out ASAP with a flat tool. (Don't try to pull it out with your fingers, you'll just squish the venom sac and empty it all in at once).

Aid: "This is where Reagan and Gorbachev met during the cold war. Kennedy also sat here when negotiating during the Cuban Missile Crisis,"

President: "It's settled. *This is where I want the stripper pole*"
I like to imagine that the Obamas did a little moving-in montage like in the rom com movies, where they're painting the walls and Michelle jokingly dabs some paint on Barack's nose and then he chases her with his paintbrush...and one of the moving boxes breaks and spills books everywhere, and their hands meet picking them up and then they look into each other's eyes...and Michelle's standing on a chair to hang the curtains but she slips and Barack catches her and they fall to the ground laughing and then they kiss.

The oval office is on the ground floor? Im not American, but I always just assumed that the oval office would be on at least the second floor with a view.
I think this is right after Clinton moved out and they had to hose the room down with bleach.
Nice to see it before Trump gold plates everything.  
Deathklok posters over here.  Demotivational Kitten posters over there.  The thickest shag carpet that is made in America - in alternating puke yellow and faded black.  Flatscreens on every wall.  Popcorn machine in the back.  Fuck the desk, put a dart board in there.
Is this really true? If this is right before a new president moves in, why are there leaves on all the trees? The inauguration is in January.
Does anyone know what kind of special features the Oval Office has? I was surprised the glass on the windows didn't look overly thick. I imagine they're bulletproof but they look thin at the top, yet they look like they have something on the bottom of the windows on the inside. 
This is just what it looked like after they repaired all the damage from when Nightcrawler was there.
There's a really sad scene in *The West Wing*, my favorite TV show. It's the last episode and President-elect Santos is being sworn in. As they do that, an army of staffers descends upon the Bartlett Oval Office and begins to pack up everything. 
Many, including Obama opt for the Resolute Desk.

http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm
Maybe Clinton can recreate something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/z9xKG9y.jpg).
I thought I'd read somewhere that they all use the same desk, and something about an antique inkwell?  Correct me if I'm wrong.
So I guess Hillary wouldn't have to worry about spending four years sitting in, that chair."

He currently looks way cooler than any black cat I've ever seen.
My daughter has mild vitiligo.  I showed her pictures of Scrappy a few weeks ago and she really wants a cat with vitiligo now. Scrappy is the jam.
TIL animals could have vitiligo.

The same thing happened to my wife's dog, which started out as a black w/ dark brown markings Pomeranian.  Around six years old, the poor thing started losing her color, and developed significant food and skin allergies along with the vitiligo.  We tried medication, prescription foods, and nothing helped.  She would regularly have explosive diarrhea, and itched constantly.  When we got our boxer, we weened all our dogs to a more natural kibble, and she improved dramatically.  But her color was gone.

She eventually passed away while I was in Afghanistan, but that dog was incredibly sweet and affectionate.  And *loved* to fetch.  For hours and hours on end, only stopping for water and/or utter exhaustion.

It's cool but it isn't ancient.
You just know at some point when the civilization existed there was a really hungover dude walking up them thinking, "I'm so sick of these bullshit stairs."
For clarity's sake, there is no such thing as "ancient Inca" anything. They weren't around for very long - only from about the 12th century until the Spanish arrived.

I took this stick on the walk of June 6, 2014 it was a good walk. And this stick was from the walk of September 12, 2015 that was also a good walk.

Seriously though this is adorable 

Edit: my first gold, I hope to one day say that this was the gold token of October 1, 2015 that was a good day.
*[I'm taking you home](http://i.imgur.com/8QUpIVu.gif)*
Growing up I had an outdoor cat that would find sticks and deposit them in my front yard.

For the longest time we assumed it was the cat, but had no proof. Until one day the entire family came out of the house and the cat is sitting near the porch with a stick in its mouth. It saw us, dropped the stick and sat on top of it so we couldn't see it.

I'm not sure why he was collecting sticks, and apparently not want us to know he was doing it.
He's making OP.
"I'm contributing"

My dog does the same thing. I use his pile as kindling in the winter. He helps bring it in
Those are collectable sticks. You can all laugh now, but one day that 2015 oak branch with the twist irregularity from the September production run is going to buy him a new dog house.
Dude he straight collects firewood for you. Thats legit. 
He's working on the logo for his new [death metal band](http://i.imgur.com/MmvCZ5E.jpg)

ALSO ON A RELATED NOTE: FIRE HAZARD 
It's that a Hoarder Collie?
"I need this stick. And this one. And that one. Oh that's a good one too."
As a wise dog once said, "[Sticks are like tree bones](http://i.imgur.com/qBhRvys.jpg)"
Somewhere on his route there is a tree that is looking worse with each passing day.
That look of proud, hard earned accomplishment is a look that I've seen very few humans have. 

That, or it's just a dog thinking about normal dog stuff and I'm reading into it *wayyyy* too much.

Either way, shit is cute, yo. 
He must think he's a millionaire. Imagine how devastated he'd be if they were all gone. 
I think your dog is trying to tell you something by creating a large bundle of sticks outside your house and its not nice.
From an animal behaviour standpoint, why would a pet or dog do this?  I can see it thinking of it as a positive reward if it brings something back to it's pack (in this case, the owner).  Or maybe it just likes chewing on sticks (it could help dental hygiene, be entertaining, seem like a replacement for doggie toys or actual prey), and it drops them in the same spot near the house before it goes inside?  Or maybe it's akin to a nest-building tendency in other species to collect things from around their environment that could either provide shelter or potentially impress a mate.
I believe your dog is a hoarder. Best take him to a shrink.

A few years ago my wife and I picked up a [Comptometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptometer) at an antique store for her grandfather who was just retiring from a long career as an accountant. [It looked like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Comptometer_model_E.png), but the copper body was pretty heavily tarnished and almost black like a really old worn penny. However, it still worked. After taking everything apart (there were hundreds of individual parts: springs, levers, gears, etc.), lubricating everything and polishing the copper shell it looked even better than the photo above, like a shiny new penny. It was incredibly impressive to see how such a complex device was put together (and very satisfying to be able to take it apart and put it back together without screwing it up!). I took photos of the inside, which I don't have access to right now, but [here's an internet pic of the inside with the shell taken off](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/08/comptometer_interior.jpg). [Here's another angle](http://www.rechenmaschinen-illustrated.com/images/Comptometer_F_sn107516_2_st.jpg).

It's crazy that this thing would not only add and subtract, but also multiply and divide (and probably even higher level calculations which I didn't know how to test) all mechanically.

Damn these mechanical stuff with gears are awesome. I think we have missed out a lot by not learning calculations in terms of gears, gear radius and teeth (Atleast I didn't). 
I woke up feeling good about myself but after seeing that I feel inadequate.  

As a clock maker, this makes me wanna cry....so many C-clips.
I can't imagine debugging that thing.
This pic makes me feel vaguely uncomfortable. It's like something out of a nightmare, where this thing is broken and it's my job to fix it. I've taken it apart, but I can't remember where any of the parts go. :o
I used to repair these things, mechanical typewriters as well, then graduated to electo-mechanical adding machines and IBM typewriters.  The tools you need to properly work on them are just as esoteric as the machines. Cool pic to.
This overwhelms my mind.
Are you guys sure this isn't Robocop's foot??
As a software engineering student I often have a hard time explaining to people outside the computer science and electrical engineering fields what it is I do. I try to explain software and that in my head I see virtual gears and levers when I'm building a piece of software. It's always felt a bit flat as explanations go, but I think if I use an image like this it will help. The gears and levers are exactly what I see when I look at code.

A place where a crocodile and a shark are so close to eat each other is a place where I never want to be. 
Zoom in and look at the sharks eyes. That's what a surprised shark looks like. 
That's a juvenile bull shark, so it will give you a nasty nip but is not really dangerous. They are in pretty much every river and residential canal estate in Australia. Bull sharks are born and grow up in fresh water, entering the ocean when they are grown, where they are indeed a bunch of dicks.

There are two types of croc in Australia: freshwater crocs (aka freshies), and saltwater crocs (aka salties). Brutus is a salty.

Determining the difference is easy enough. Simply jump into the river. If the croc quietly climbs out on the opposite bank and gives you a surly look, it's a freshie.

If the croc surges toward you, grabs your leg and pulls you under the water in a choas of flailing limbs, rolls around a few times and drowns you, then swims off and plants your body in a mud bank,  returning to take a bite from your rotting corpse every couple of days, then it was a salty.
He stopped the shark from drowning. Brutus is a hero.
Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.
As the shark was valiant, I honour him: but, as the shark was ambitious, I ate him.
Call me dumb but I had no idea sharks and crocodiles lived in the same waters.
[I prefer this one](http://i.imgur.com/Nrxp5wG.gif)
The Shark probably made the mistake of considering Brutus his trusted advisor.
He's giant, how do they find him? Just listen for the clock ticking perhaps?
Et tu, Brute?
[Here's the rest of the pics of Brutus going full apex](http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/aug/06/crocodile-v-shark-tourist-captures-epic-northern-territory-battle)
Is that the N.T crocodile who is about 80 years old? Doesn't he have bullet-hole scars from being shot at many years ago? I saw him earlier this year, he's huge.
[Here's a close up](http://i.imgur.com/iZloADd.jpg) of the crocodile, and the article [source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2718627/Brutus-giant-croc-pictured-eating-bull-shark-star.html)
There's a B movie in there somewhere
Welcome to Australia.
I went on this cruise, you hardly see brutus anymore as he's a bit of a prude and doesn't like the crowds or tour boats. They thought he was dead for a while too as he hadn't been seen for a while, they had some big young males move into the area recently and they thought he got him

> While doing a survey of bison on the refuge in late July 2013, Wildlife Biologist Karen Viste-Sparkman noticed a bull standing by himself. On closer inspection, it was clear that he had been struck by lightning and burned over a large area of his body. Sparky was thin after the strike and wasn't expected to live long. Since a lightning strike is something that could happen to wild bison anywhere, the refuge let nature take its course. But two years later, Sparky is going strong!

It says "Still no terror attacks in France" with the terrorist saying "hang on, we still have until the end of January to give our new year wishes"
It must be noted that Charlie Hebdo has always made fun of all religions, not only islam.
Charb, one of the caricaturists killed today, said earlier, after receiving death threats from islamists: **"I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit. It perhaps sounds a bit pompous, but I prefer to die standing than living on my knees."** Source: http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/charlie-hebdo-charb-cabu-wolinsky-et-tignous-morts-dans-la-fusillade-07-01-2015-1894661_23.php

They apparently yelled that they were avenging Mohammed. What kind of god or prophet needs vengeance from a comic? These attacks don't show people's strength of conviction, they show the weakness of their beliefs. No one has ever strapped a bomb to their chest because of their belief in quantum mechanics or group theory.
Between the majority of media's decision not to show these artists' works uncensored, and Sony caving to North Korea's (partially successful) attempt to prevent the release of The Interview, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the way our culture has caved to the violent, threatening tactics of fanaticism. Free-thinking nations should not be shriveling up like this in the face of hatred and oppression of thought. What a shameful time we live in.
Jesus fucking christ, it's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated.

Some of you mentioned that you shouldn't do something that will offend all Muslims. I disagree. No group and no person should be above satire. Side note: A connect-the-dots of "TPM" would be fun if it was directed at the proper websites. 
You know, I'm extremely liberal when it comes to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and open immigration, but even I think it's time for Europe to tell Muslim immigrants to assimilate or expatriate. You want to wear hijabs and preach in the street? Fine. Want to convert old, unused churches to mosques? Groovy, awesome way to preserve architecture. Want to offer Middle East studies and Arabic in schools? Capital idea! Want to hold open iftars? Save a slice of baklava for me. Want to issue death threats in public protests, carry out honor killings and establish sharia courts? Well have fun doing that in the stone age shitheaps where that nonsense still flies, but you can get right the fuck out of my civilized society if you're going to behave like an animal.
Fuck that. I'm in tears. Sadness and anger boil inside.

My second favorite character from those movies. Pai Mei being my favorite.
Just watched both Kill Bill's for the first time last night, she was a badass bitch
Chiaki Kuriyama!
Kudos to the photographer as well. Great perceptive. 
This arouses me more than it should.
Anyone else find it weird when you are doing something and it appears elsewhere in the day. I am watching Kill Bill right now and Beatrix just killed Gogo when I open reddit and this is on the front page. Love the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

I came to Paris (while backpacking) just for Bastille Day. This display and performance blew any 4th of July celebration out of the water. There was a story, and a fantastic Orchestra, and a guy scaling the side of the tower in a glowing suit! 
This is what r/pics is for.  Not interesting stories, interesting pictures.  Thanks!

This is going to be my new wallpaper. Awesome pic. Merci!

I rarely get that 'holy shit that's amazing' feeling from a photo...but holy shit THIS IS AMAZING. Perfect timing, color, composition...do you shoot professionally? 
From one photographer to another /u/dishesRdone, this is totally bad ass. Very well done!

Great picture, OP :)
This is the best picture of the Eiffel Tower I've seen in my entire life.

Used to do this with a friend when I lived in the Caribbean. Find a good heavy rock, then one person would carry it out until the water was up to their mouth, drop under and run it out as far as they could with one breath. When they came up, the other swam to them, dove down and grabbed the rock and went as far as they could, until it got so deep, or we were too tired to be able to carry it out any further. Tons of fun. Fun trying to find it the next day and bring it back to shore the same way too.

You can't fool me. This is Las Vegas. You can tell by the giant pointy thing in the middle.
What are those columns under the arch at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower? Are they temporary/permanent supports?

I went to Paris in 2013 and they were there are the time.
Just for info, since this perspective of "Paris" is so common, but it's misleading. The photo is taken from the Montparnasse tower. You see a zoom of the Eiffel Tower in the foreground, and the Business district of La Défense in the background, but those towers of La Défense aren't in Paris proper. They're in the suburbs. Here's how the photo was taken: http://i.imgur.com/zwgGzUa.jpg

Just saying, most of what you see in the photo isn't Paris proper.
I would love a high resolution version of this.
Amazing picture.  
  
Why do all the rooftops in the foreground look like scrapyards? 
[This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Panorama_La_D%C3%A9fense.jpg) reverse view (La Défense in the foreground and the Eiffel tower in the background is quite cool too)
I was there for two days a few years ago. Fell absolutely in love with it. 
Truly a beautiful city from any angle. 
La Defense always looks so futuristic from this angle. I think it's because of it contrasting with the historic Eiffel Tower.
I see the beauty in that picture and then I remember the time a bird shat on my face under the Eiffel Tower.
I didn't know the Eiffel Tower had a football field in front of it!
Is that La Defense in the back?
The smog brings a nice ambient glow to the shot.

Caribbean cruise ships should install amphibious assault well decks so that passengers can swim like Marines and/or get eaten by sharks.
FYI this isn't a carrier. It's an amphib. Most of those guys are probably marines, not sailors. The sailors are probably in RHIBs for shark watch. 
Did you try to touch the bottom?
Y'know, for guys that spend months on end on deck on a boat out in the ocean they seem surprisingly pale
Who is the person in the life preserver, and how much did you harass them after you found out they can't swim in the navy?

Edit: changed to gender neutral

Edit 2: how can English be if theys no words?
Man, I love swimming in the deep ocean like that.  It's a feeling like no other.
You can see how happy the two gingers are to be out in the sun.

...Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, Bosun's Mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
Practically all people on the ship are black, practically all people in the water are white.

I've had my Dachshund wander back to the house after getting loose for an hour in the same pose with more of the deer leg than that.

Didn't look anywhere near as badass though.
This is bad-ass because the coyote is clearly doing it just to be bad-ass.  There is zero meat on that hoof.  He's carrying it around as a message.
*(Totalus Badassius)*
/r/shittyHDR
It certainly can be hard to appear badass when you are a scavenger. 
That coyote definitely did not kill that deer/elk. And it very definitely did not rip off its hoof. 
And it is most definitely a poser.





Can I get some wolf love up in this motherfucker?!? 
oh shut up, the coyote absolutely paid the photographer to help him fake this picture for his coyote friends.
Meep meep
Way more bad ass than most coyotes I see. They're skinny little shits eating garbage in Golden Gate Park.
I just ate some chicken wings and felt cool until I saw this.
Okay so I'm from a country with no wolves or coyotes or anything.  Can someone tell me how just looking at this you'd know it was a coyote and not a wolf?  Coz to me that just looks like a young wolf.

This was when Sony was an engineering company. It became a media company later. In other news, Sony Stores are closing across Canada end of this month.
I had one of those! 1984, I was 19, living in a shitbag studio guest house in NJ. My GF would come over and I'd be up and down all night, changing rekkids on the Sony "toaster". She was a Deadhead and brought a copy of the first "Kingfish" album. I thought it was pretty good! Smoking weed with her helped, I guess. 

BTW: I played Genesis "Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" a million times on that thing and I still have the albums. They're in good shape. The toaster did not eat them!

>If you're here, you've probably seen our "Text and Drive" billboard. And if you have, you probably came to this website to tell us what horrible people we are for running an ad like that. And you'd be right.

>It is a horrible thing for a funeral home to do. But we're not a funeral home.

>We're just trying to get Canadians to stop texting and driving, which is projected to kill more people in Ontario this year than drinking and driving. That's right. More. And while most people wouldn't even think about drinking and driving, over half of Ontario drivers admit to reading texts while behind the wheel. That's more than half of the drivers on the road today risking their lives, their passengers' lives and the lives of their fellow motorists and pedestrians.

I'm more interested in that awesome slide behind the billboard.

The irony is that anyone who texts and drives won't see this. 
look, funeral homes are looking for ways to increase revenues just like everybody else so they have decided to go from just waiting for people to die to actively helping them along. Next thing there will be a guy up there with a sniper rifle.
The big text's font doesn't look like Times New Roman. Anyone know what it is?

Speak the truth.
with summer almost here, I've been trying to walk more than drive recently, it is monumentally frustrating to see so many drivers with their heads aimed at their crotches, at one particular point of road,  just after traffic lights, I've noticed about 1 in 5 have accelerated to 40mph but are still finishing the text or whatever they started back when waiting for the red to change (bad enough already). I CANNOT WAIT FOR FULLY AUTOMATED CARS TO BE INESCAPABLE LAW. 
I'm tempted to call that a Pirates of the Caribbean reference.

My uncle was in hospital for a long time, and it was striking that the hospital in Scotland would spend so much money on fancy equipment, and nothing on small things which would improve the stay one-hundred fold.

An example: they had high-tech beds with televisions, and telephones, but they didn't have an engineering contract to service them, so noone could use them. My uncle was an engineer and planned to donate his services when he got out, but he never did. 
This is fantastic. I have always wanted to have this done at our nonprofit but never knew how to go about it. One day I will figure it out. Thank you for donating your time and doing this to help bring people a smile. It is appreciated.

Some people have been saying it is hard to build one and other have been wanting one. After seeing this post I went to walmart and got a container (acrylic jar) and ordered a fountain pump (210 GPH) off of Amazon. After about 30 minutes of work (and waiting for the pump) I have the following videos. [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2qxCGKeI4A) and [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQAnvFZ_oRs). I still have some clean up to do like build the rock platform (waiting on acrylic solvent), fixing the top rim, and gluing the tube in. 

My smaller scale version could definitely be built in a day (on a smaller scale) with the parts on hand and for those of you that like to build things I would suggest trying this as it is quick and pretty. So far I am about 30 dollars for parts.

The building was built assumed that another was going to be built along side it. Flash forward a few decades and a renovation in that spot created a room that needed a window for Cleveland building code reasons. Now there is a window.
Cleveland baby! Knew I recognized it, then zoomed in and was reassured. 
In the spirit of "I want a god damn window" I like to imagine the common office worker, coming in on a weekend with an appropriate rented saw and just did the hole himself, patched up a cheap window in there, cleaned up everything and came back on monday to his ordinary office, which is now the only one with a window.
It almost looks like another building use to be attached to that one? Or could it just be a shadow... 
No biggie, that's just room 1408.  
OSHA regs. That's the fire escape.
Sniper perch.
I knew that building looked familiar, Clevelander for life :3
One of the cool things that gets glossed over about Cleveland is that each of the buildings are old enough to carry some history. It may not be the caliber that Europe has, but over 100 years of development and change isn't paltry either. 

One of the defining statements of major cities these days are skyscrapers. If you think about it skyscraper technology isn't that old, only exploding in the past 50 years or so. 50 years ago, Cleveland was a fully functioning, top 10 US city. There was really no need to build up a brand new huge building (and you couldn't really). Excluding a few buildings in NYC, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in the world for 20 years and the US for 30. 

Unfortunately by this time the companies and jobs that made up Cleveland were being moved elsewhere and any new developments were quickly cancelled. That combined with the invention that is the air conditioner and Cleveland slowly lost it's status. We were still a top 10 city in 1970 which wasn't *that* long ago.

Regarding these tourism videos, yes I am from Ohio and I do currently live in Cleveland (what makes you think I'm biased?). I remember when these videos came out and laughing at how spot on they were. To some extent they still are. HOWEVER. Things are looking up and a lot of new social places are opening up. We've getting back into the skyscraper phase with a nice hotel that'll hopefully be ready for the RNC (it will but nothing will work). And finally, if this nuCLEus project goes forward, it'll be interesting to see what else spawns from that. 

Will Cleveland ever return to status it used to have? No, least not in any reasonable time frame. It's cold and that's something we can't change and compete with. Cleveland does have a distinct advantage of not having to worry about natural disasters. So who knows, maybe in 300 years we'll be relevant again.

Plot twist, it's a broom closet.

My dad used to know a guy that worked at the broadcast control room at the top of the CN Tower.  The room was all [concrete walls, blaring cooling fans, and TV signal displays.](http://www.roadwolf.ca/files/blogpics/CNTower/94538.jpg)  He said he was getting miserable, possibly S.A.D., from never seeing the sunlight.

So he asked management about installing a single porthole window.  He pressured them enough that they actually bothered to look into it, and they said it would cost $20,000, and that they were willing to pay for half if he paid for the other half.  Never did get the porthole installed.

Guy had some cool stories though.  Like [the Northeast Blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) - he said you could see the power rolling out from block to block - it didn't just all immediately shut off at once, it moved like a wave in the ocean.  Of course, he didn't have his camera.

He also got us in the CN Tower for free, through the basement security entrance, and we got to see the cool control room at the top of the tower that visitors can't see.  

EDIT: Since folks are interested, I'll share this cool photo:

http://www.roadwolf.ca/files/blogpics/CNTower/94536.jpg

From his control room, he was actually able to "go outside", although you still couldn't see any sunlight, that thin metal wall is the wall that people do the edge walk on.

There was a house that had one window on the side on my friends street, I always made fun of it to him and his mom. Turns out I met the people who lived there later in life and it was a strange feelings staring through that window. 
That window was covertly carved open, over the course of months, behind a sexy poster on the wall.

This is awesome!  But also for an entirely different reason--realizing this is /r/pics and not /r/aerodynamics, anyone not interested in aerodynamics turn back, move along, nothing to see here...

This is the first visualization in the natural world (i.e., not in a wind tunnel) I've come across that illustrates adverse yaw, the use of differential aileron to correct it, and the effect it exerts on the tracking of "wake" or wing tip vortices.  As anyone who has spent time near a major airport knows, the little whirlwinds that stream off wing tips or edges of flaps--and which the **[newish winglets](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/24/business/Why-Winglets.html?_r=0)** try to combat--descend after the plane has passed and can make a crackling noise or disturb the tops of trees when they descend to ground level.

If the pilot is skimming above cloud tops as in this photo, those vortices will descend behind the plane and the combined **["downwash"](https://tianyizf1.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/trailing-vortex.jpg)** from where the tip vortices meet will disturb the clouds--that's why we only see one "slice" caused by the two tip vortices in this image, but **[this photo](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/downwash.html)** of a business jet penetrating just the tops of the clouds illustrates the two separate wing tip vortices.

However, if you look closely, notice that, as the aircraft banks to the right, the slice is displaced to the outside of the turn, to the left of the aircraft track.  The reason for this is asymmetric induced drag--the downward deflecting aileron that raises the left wing tip causes a momentary increase in what is known as induced drag.  Simply said, banking to the right makes the left wing tip vortex stronger than its counterpart on the right.  The increased lift caused by the lowered aileron causes that wing to pull up and back harder than the right wing is "pulled" down, whose aileron is up.

That increase in drag would tend to pull the nose of the aircraft to the left, towards the outboard wing, which is a bad thing from an aerodynamics stand point--it requires more rudder to maintain coordinated flight, and thus, more drag to overcome, so higher fuel costs.  So a concept called **[differential aileron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/DifferentialAileron.svg)** is employed to cause the inboard (right) wing to raise the aileron more than the outboard (left) wing lowers its aileron.  But here's the key: the raised aileron results in more drag, but largely in the form of separation drag--that's when the air doesn't flow smoothly over the upper wing surface, but starts to get more turbulent.  This disruption in airflow causes more drag to be generated across the wing, but keeps the amount of outward **[spanwise flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:Tip_vortex_rollup.png)**on the upper wing surface lower. Spanwise flow is responsible for initiating wing tip vortices and winglets attempt to minimize it. The end effect is the generation of a smaller wing tip vortex on the inboard wing.

We're in the home stretch: when the two wing tip vortices combine, one stronger, the other weaker, their interaction causes the net downwash of airflow in the wake of the aircraft to track toward the stronger wing tip vortex, and thus as they descend, will veer to the outside of the turn.  Furthermore, the bank angle of the aircraft will accentuate this effect, as the lateral force component of the stronger wing tip vortex will bias the downwash to the outboard side. This is what we can see clearly from this otherwise picturesque, very cool shot.

**TL;DR: Perfect visualization of induced drag in a turning aircraft which biases the downwash to the outside of the turn.**

NOTE: For the pilots and perfectionists here, though the pilot eases up on the yoke/stick input that initiated the turn after the bank angle is established, a little bit of inboard bank input is held to prevent the natural stabilizing effect that aircraft with dihedral experience, which requires more lift on the outboard wing to counter the increased upward lift component on the inboard, more horizontal wing, which still results in a differential in induced drag between wingtips.  These changes in control surface input during turns are responsible when you see **[strake/LEX and wing tip vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:FA-18C_vapor_LEX_and_wingtip_1.jpg)** appear during airshow demonstrations more prevalently as hard turns are initiated, which then dissipate/disappear when the pilot establishes bank angle and/or unloads.

-Dr. Seuss, the Croc in the Yard
Gators gonna gait.
Interior crocodile alligator
I posted this elsewhere in the thread, but hey, maybe it won't get buried if I try again.

Lowcountry South Carolina checking in: the biggest risk we run with gators here is the idiotic tourists who come down and think they're cool to fuck around with. I've literally seen tourists on banks and docks casting fishing lines trying to hit the gator with their bait, to agitate it. And worse, I've seen (and stopped) tourists approaching a seven-footer to try and feed it *Chick-Fil-A nuggets.* 

The problem is, if it happens enough times, the alligator will get used to receiving food from people. And then they start to see people and think "food!" And then they start to approach people. And then they think, this person is holding out on me, being all coy backing away instead of giving me my chicken nuggets! And then they follow the person, who perceives it as aggression.

You can't relocate an alligator; they've fought other gators for the right to whatever territory they live in and they *will come back.* They will come back.

It *ruins* an alligator when they begin to feel comfortable associating with humans. I don't know of a single state that actually "removes" alligators--relocation doesn't work. Nine times out of ten, any pest control or park service you call will end up euthanizing any gator they've received a complaint about.

Here's a series of articles about a 50 year old gator who caused some ruckus in my town last June:

* First, someone saw him and complained. So he was removed.
* [Then he came back](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/03/3143848/whopper-gator-found-hilton-head.html) to his original location
* Someone complained that he was relocated rather than killed, so [an investigation started](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/04/3146663/large-alligators-release-to-be.html)
* A resident said that the gator [wasn't aggressive](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/07/3151999/hilton-head-islander-speaks-up.html)
* But the pest control guy lost his contract with the city anyway and the 50 year old, 1000 pound gator was killed.
* Some people [didnt think the guy shouldve lost his job](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/09/3203948/petition-supporting-gator-wrangler.html)
* That's when things got really interesting. Another alligator was hit by a car on one of our busy highways in town. The city, having just terminated their contract with the-guy-who-handles-this-sort-of-thing, didnt have anyone to go and pick it up. So, over the next few hours and in the ensuing traffic jam, all of our tourists and residents were treated to a delightful viewing of this alligators slow death in the median. [Article](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/03/3195631/maffo-critter-management-lose.html)


So, here are some tips for next time you see an alligator during your vacation:

* Respect them. Take photos from a respectable distance.
* Do not approach or harass them. They are not in a glass tank and they are not here to entertain you--you do not need to interact with them.
* Do not pick up, approach or harass their babies. Alligator moms actually do stick around their young and nurture them.
* Take care to look after your own young children and pets, as those are the most likely things an alligator will mistakenly see as food.
* Please don't call animal control just because you *see* a gator. Only call animal control if the animal is behaving in an aggressive way, or approaching humans. Gators who are minding their own business don't deserve to be euthanized just for existing.
* For the love of god, do not attempt to feed them chicken nuggets.
So what's the legal standpoint of shooting one that's in your yard?

Sure you claim it's a bar, but I know a sex dungeon/torture chamber when I see one.
There is quite a cool cocktail bar in Nottingham, UK called the Boilermaker. It looks like a shop selling household boilers, you go into a 'staff toilet' area, push the wall with the sink in it and enter the bar.

It does some cool cocktails as well.

There is a bar her in my town that is hidden behind a cigarette machine at the back of another bar. My GF and I were in the bar one night and I asked the waiter what was behind the cigarette machine, he looked at me as asked "what cigarette machine?" he then turns around and sees that the door is open, turns back to me and says "oh that cigarette machine" and starts telling me all about it and how you have to apply to get a membership to go there and you can only take 3 guests with you and then there is more hidden rooms inside the bar.

its like half life 2

I hope there's another Coca-Cola machine in the bar so people who go to the bar and look at it thinking is there another bar back there for vips ore something.

They have a few of these in London. One is called "The Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town". It's in a restaurant and if you go up to the bar and say "I'd like to speak to the mayor" they open up the fridge and it lets you into the bigger bar area.

Theres another one called "Evans & Peel - Detective Agency". If you go in the front door there is just a man sitting at an old fashioned desk with a typewriter and stuff. If you go up to him and say something like "I need some place to hide", they let you through a secret door into a jazz bar.

2nd time Croatia's been on the frontpage this weekend! :) (Other time: https://np.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/4az739/mrw_someone_asks_me_how_to_spell_the_croatian/)

Croatia big and stronk
I like how I zoomed in to read the lamps only to realize the zoom function doesn't teach me Croatian. 
If you go to Dubrovnik be sure to walk the walls - it's only 10 USD or so and an amazing experience. 
This the type of thing this sub should actually be for - beautiful and impressive pictures.
Holy hell, no crowds! Dubrovnik is gorgeous but it's SO busy.
I used to live outsid of Dubrovnik in a small place called Cavtat. The alleys and promenades in Dubrovnik are amazing. The city is so old and enchanting.  Be sure to try your luck with the kissing stone. I could only stay for a few seconds!
Visiting here in May,  I can't wait.  I got nothing specific in mind to do other than just wandering around and taking in this amazing looking place. 
I was a bit disappointed with Dubrovnik. It truly is a beautiful place to go and visit but what I found a shame was they they have turned the whole centre into a tourist trap. Not a single building in the centre wasn't crammed full of souvenirs to buy. It was either a souvenir shop or a bar /  restaurant. I Just found it a bit of a shame. 
Croatia is such a beautiful country, stoked to go again this year. If anyone is in sibenik around august hit me up! Just kidding ;)
CTRL+F `MAY`
  
WTF? A reddit meetup?
That's got to be Diagon Alley...
I'm going there in May, I can't wait.
That's Kings Landing. 
Was recently there, in the old town as well. Be sure to walk around the wall, it's awesome
I'm going there in May, I can't wait!

This is why I'm very suspicious that only 17 people have been killed.
That is a good 200metres from the impact area... Wow. The force was at least half a kilometre in diameter?! Poor factory workers...
That's a lot of the exact same model and color vehicle.
This is exactly what I imagine an apocalypse to look like
Holy shit, it's like a poster for an apocalypse movie or something. I'm finding it difficult to even comprehend the size of the blast.
Eyes up guardian. 
Do we have any idea where this was in relation to the blast site? 
Yes had no idea how big a deal this was
Here's news coverage from CNN on the situation: http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/12/asia/china-port-explosion/

i just cant get over how the dude looks like typical kid of a billionaire villain.

*IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!*

You've heard "fake it 'till you make it". He heard "fraud it 'till the audit".
[deleted]
Reminds me of when Ryan from The Office got arrested for fraud. Same kind of Douche-baggery going on there. 
So now that we know he's not in the apartment, can Bill Murray break in and steal the Wu Tang album? Or was that all fake?
Damn that cop looks smooth as fuck I bet he saw this pic and went "good thing I look suave as fuck"
They should set his bail, then raise it 5000%
http://i.imgur.com/QONVIyz.gif
Ha ha Martiiiin. You look like a bitch.
The RZA and the feds were in on it the whole time! Get the most hated man in America to buy the Wu Tang album, then track the money to prove it came from client accounts and finally get the evidence needed to take him down. Now it's time for Bill Murray and Clan to pull off their heist and release the album for free! Wu Tang saves the day!
Reminds me of a scene from a [movie...](http://imgur.com/GovShO2)
But he has money, so, "getting arrested" doesn't mean, "going to prison for his crimes" as much as it just means "waiting in a building for an hour until his lawyer shows up with the money". 
Just remember when they make a movie in 15-20 years called something like 'Hedge Fund Pharma Wolf', he wasn't the hero the movie will make him out to be.
I'm not seeing the shit-eating grin.  Where is the shit-eating grin?
5 years from now, he's going to realize he can make millions of dollars per year by going on speaking tours telling people about how he was a bad boy and broke the law. Then he'll pay someone to write a book about it and it'll get turned into a blockbuster movie that makes him out to be a roguish scamp instead of an anti-social, narcissistic sociopath.
Looks like the origins of the lamest super villain ever
I want SOO badly for this to be the start of a larger crackdown on these sorts of people and activities. But I know realistically he will either get off way to easy or be made an example of while his peers cover their tracks.
See Martin, this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass

tesla + 24 hour gym membership.. you dont need a home.


You can live in a Tesla but you can't drive a house!
I would assume the dude is just on a work site and eating lunch. He is eating from a tupperware container. 
That's why he had the money *to buy* a Tesla.
When the restaurant is full and you have to eat in your car. This is a pretty awesome solution to not mess up your car.
Hell install a tv there steal wifi from work or load up your favourite shows on your laptop at home and your are golden.
Best lunch breaks ever. No one blabing while you just want to eat and you dont have to share. This man gives no fucks about what others think or do and i respect that.
His life is a mesla
Ironically, [a 24-year-old Tesla engineer lived in a van parked at Tesla's headquarters for 5 months](https://medium.com/@Jason_Roesslein/silicon-valley-vanlife-95c03a761e8a#.blruu358k).
It's pretty obvious that this guy is an engineer. He has plenty of money but sees no reason to spend it at a restaurant and has determined that his hatchback is an efficient table space for his packed lunch where no one will bother him. Engineer.

I come home one particular evening
The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?",
I said, "No, can't find no job,
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent"
She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"
Said "I seen you today you was eating out of the trunk of your Tesla"
I said "But I'm tired, I've been drivin' all day"
holy fuck... he is a genious Listen guys, just because somebody bought an expencive car, does not mean their are wealthy. this guy probably saved up for it. good for him. and now he can enjoy his fruits of frugality in his car. wonderful. 
Well, I guess we can all assume who got the house... 
If its stupid and it works it ain't stupid

Or get divorced...
That's a really smart idea to live in a Tesla since the fuel is free.
Buying a Tesla in the future is the only materialistic goal I have in my life. 
This is the Tesla RV.  Cheaper than a Winnebago.  Needs a bigger crapper tho.

I gotta say, your painting gives even Bob Ross a run for his money. It's an excellent piece and I'm glad you've kept it. I really wish I could do that.

1.) Do you now have a perm?

2.) Are you still painting?
"The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe."  He always seemed like such a decent guy who legitimately cared about people and brightening their day - like Mr. Rogers with a paintbrush.  I really wish he was still around giving a new generation some happy little trees.
Knew I recognized that painting for some reason; TIL that a Bob Ross painting is the cover art for [Annuals' *Such Fun*](https://annuals.bandcamp.com/album/such-fun) album!

For some context, this note appeared on /u/ricktencity's appartment door in 2012 - https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12f0zr/awesome_dad_left_this_note_on_my_apartment_door/

As /u/and_what_army said then:

> This family has already been through hell. A child with seizures is hard enough, but by the time they go on a Keto diet it usually means traditional treatments have been exhausted and all the normal medicines (Banzel, Klonopin, Depakote, Diastat, Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, and probably others) don't work. Keto as a medical treatment is much harder than Keto for weight control. Fletcher probably had to go into the hospital for 2-3 days while he adjusted to being on the diet, and now everything that passes his lips must be weighed to the 1/10th gram. He probably can't even wear the wrong kind of sunscreen, because anything on the skin could affect the body chemistry for the Keto diet.
I ordered a bag of glow-in-the-dark toys for kids who want them or who can't take candies. I also printed signs that read, "**Toys available for kids with allergies. Shots available for adults with kids.**"

I spent more on Jameson and little plastic glasses than toys and candies, but it's probably a decent investment to build some goodwill for my first Halloween in the neighborhood.

Edit: Thank you, anonyperson, for the Gold. It's a real treat.
My son does not have medical restrictions on his diet.

Nonetheless, I eat his candy.

Because I am a responsible parent who goes the extra mile.
Here's what I do as a crazy irresponsible parent with a kid who is actually severely allergic to peanuts (I say actually because many people claim to be who aren't, seriously).  We go trick or treating and do not burden our neighbors with anything.  Fill up the bag with whatever!  Then when we get home we break out the safe treat bag and start the trading.  He couldn't care less because he doesn't know what he's missing and loves red-vines, skittles etc.  We can usually redistribute most of the unsafe candy back out to the remaining trick or treaters, and what is still left over goes to work with me (although it might not all make it further than my desk).

First lesson with allergies; it's on you to manage it.  I've had people actually say to him "no it doesn't have peanuts in it, just peanut butter."  He learned how to read ingredients at 5 and he's managed it pretty well.
I had a step child with PKU and a child with other unrelated food allergies. Our solution was to let them go hog wild on Halloween and get as much candy as they could. I would then pay them $1/pound for the candy and we would go and buy a toy the following weekend. I'd take the candy to work and then I didn't have to worry about the kids sneaking candy they shouldn't have, they got to experience Halloween the same way as all the other kids, and they got a new toy. It seemed to work pretty well. Just a thought for parents who would like their kids to have the experience but don't have the time to send out nice fliers with attached toys.
Plot development: One of the receiver of the letter bought an angry bird costume and introduced himself as Fletcher on halloween
This is the kind of thing my cousins family would do. Ever since he was an infant he's been deathly allergic to a long list of things (walking past a boiling pot of wheat-based pasta once triggered an asthma attack from the vapour). 

The family didn't turn the house into a bubble, they didn't ban anything coming into the home. They just made a little sign on the door informing people that someone with severe allergies lives there and to please follow some basic steps to avoid any issues (they'd always mention it to a first-time visitor though). Simple things like "Please wash your hands after eating or handling any food products", having a cupboard strictly for his dishes and food, no perfume. 

*He* was taught to watch for things, wash his hands religiously, and to bring his own stuff (like popcorn to theatres, letting the staff know of the allergies), not to rely on other people who probably have no clue. He's nearly 20 now and still very much alive.

In many ways it's comparable to a disability. Yes society adapts to a point but it's really up to individuals to learn how to live with it.

(Edits for clarity...and spelling)
Active vs. Passive parenting. Not trying to bash the other post, but *this* is how to properly handle your child's allergies/diet on Halloween.
This doesn't belong to me, but the 'responsible' parent who posted about her kids peanut allergy pissed me off and reminded me of this awesome parent. 

EDIT: Wow this really blew up! jumped 50 upvotes in 1 refresh! 

EDIT: Front page! thanks

EDIT: GOLD! Thanks!
This could just be an elaborate ruse to find out ahead of time which houses to skip over in order to maximize the Halloween haul. 

My record is 5 1/2 large pillow cases loaded with candy within the 2 hour window, but this type of info could really help me out. After all, I turned 37 this year, and my legs aren't quite what they used to be.
How irresponsible to name your child "Fletcher."
With all the weirdos, allergies, and special diets out there these days, it's really a wonder that trick or treating even exists anymore. 
I have epilepsy and had to go through this same ordeal. However, instead of parents handing out toys, my parents just said I was too old to trick or treat. 

... I was 6. 
Lame...A real parent would sue all the candy manufacturers and each household that gave him candy. 
Oh look, this post again this year?
So much parenting advice on Reddit, where my guess most people don't have kids.

All you need to know is that the Rhino tried to save the foal but unfortunately the foal died despite his best efforts.
Obviously a sad end for the Zebra... But poor Rhino.  He had such good intentions.   
Creationist rhino stops baby zebra from becoming a fossil.
The world tricks you into thinking shit is all right but then **BLAM!** the zebra actually got disemboweled.
I think these pictures are reversed.  The rhino is obviously putting the zebra in the mud.

Why is the Rhino displaying cross-species altruistic behavior? That's what I wanna know. 
What a waste that would be some awesome fossil in few million years...
ARTAX!!!!!!
Regardless of the outcome, this shows rhinos' horns are much better used by rhinos than by alternative medicine.
Can we finally stop the poacher hate? Every time someone poaches a rhino horn, he's really just saving the life of a zebra.

Party like you just do care...
YOU GOTTA COOPERATE. FOR YOUR RIGHT. TO PARRRTAY
16 yo me and a bunch of high school friends were hanging out in a park in Washington DC consoling one of our buds whose mother had just died. Sure we were drinking, Mountain Dew. Metro PD comes in with gusto ready to make an easy bust, we suprised them by just sitting there with sad expressions. Once they got the story they apologized to us and especially our buddy. Ended up adding some laughs to the sorrow.
Hooligans! Next thing they'll be forming a choir! >(
>150 youths

>most of the youths got into a vehicle

Was this some sort of clown convention?

*EDIT: OK, OK! I was just trying to make a joke, not start a grammargeddon! Get out of my inbox, you clowns! It's gonna burst!
My house threw a party where a cop showed up due to a noise complaint. As we talked to him, he looked inside and said "it looks like a sausage fest in here." Lolz
YOU GOTTA FIGHT. FOR YOUR RIGHT. TO PAAAAARTY.

AND RECOGNIZE, OF COURSE, THAT WITH RIGHTS COME CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES.
My friends all signed a lease for an apartment together which had a clause in it stating "no foam parties" (For those who don't know it's where you lay down tarps and stuff and fill your apartment with soap suds and bubbles, obviously there can be some serious damage)

We mused on the idea of filling our apartment with foam, and then all sitting and studying in the waist high foam. So when the landlord came and said "No foam parties!" We'd all act really mad and say "Excuse me does this look like a party? We all have exams tomorrow could you please leave?"

Fucking kids these days. When I was a kid I *knew* how to get in trouble
I threw a Halloween party at my house in college once, 300some people showed up (we had a big house and a big fenced in yard)  It was wild, DJs, bouncers, girls dancing on the bar, 3 floors of madness.  It was awesome.

Well at about 2am the cops showed up in full force expecting to have to chase down tons of underage drinkers and drug users.  Thankfully we prepared.  When the cops showed up we had the 2 "bouncers" greet them and texted us that it was time to break up the time. 

I got on the DJ's mic and told everyone that the cops were here and wanted the party to end, but they didn't want trouble.  So I urged everyone to NOT run, as it creates a panicky atmosphere where cops and students are freaking out.  

All the students left, no arrest or citations, and even though I was underage, the cops left us with a verbal warning.  The head officer then came to me, shook my hand, and said great party and thanks for ending it so calmly.

We got to party like animals for 5 hours and it had 0 negative outcomes.


*TL'DR - cops like a good party as much as the next guy, and thanked us for ending it when they asked in a responsible manner*
I love being Canadian.
Why couldn't they just let them turn down their music? 
This is actually amazing.
In high school my friends and I threw a graduation party with no alcohol. All the partiers were either in some music department or taking AP classes and headed to college next fall. 

We had the cops come into the backyard because of noise complaints/possible drinking/typical suburban problems. The first conversation they heard was about Cello and what it takes to play at a collegiate level between me and my friend. 

Literally the words the cops said to us were, "oh we can see you kids are  having fun, try to keep it down your neighbors are worried." 

That was a fun summer. memories. 
[Expectation](http://i.imgur.com/DyO8lrw.jpg)

[Reality](http://i.imgur.com/LAJgYB0.jpg)
For those note sure if this is Canadian. 

RCMP = Royal Canadian Mounted Police
RCMP, Sandy Beach, Calgary possibly? Also good on the kids for having designated drivers, being cooperative and cleaning up garbage!
[Youths.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzf7ahV5pg1qm2l53o1_500.gif)
Why was the byline and police officer's name struck out? Surely it's okay if the name of the person who reported the story is on the pic. 
Running from the cops used to be one of my favorite parts of high school and college parties. 
>youths

>had a sober driver

>implying drunk passengers

>No mention or slightest care about drunk youths.

Party on.
These guys need to step their game up for next time.

Like, throw another party, have the music bumping loud enough for the neighbors to get bothered by the bass, and get the cops called again.

Only this time when the police bust in, it's 150 kids, and they're all sitting in fancy chairs, wearing smoking jackets and reading newspapers, while Pachelbel's Canon plays loudly in the background as they [clear their throats and angrily jostle their papers at the rude interruption.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFHyZSXKMw)
Little did they know that the party they broke up was a diversion for the real party happening in the abandend warehouse only 2 blocks away!
You rarely see positive stories in the paper, where do you even live?
Why black out a public newspaper?

I just wanted to make a PSA as the mod for /r/InvasiveSpecies, for anyone seeing this photo and thinking it might be a good idea to play Wisteria in their yard... keep in mind that the two species of Wisteria commonly found in the US and Europe used in landscaping, [Japanese and Chinese Wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria), are both hugely robust invasive species, especially in the [Southeast and Northeast parts of the US](http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/map/img/wisi1.gif). While it is very beautiful and sweet smelling, its has the ability to escape its ornamental confines in vine form, and then establish itself in the wild, where its aggressive vines creep around the forest floor, choking and out-competing many native understory species. Furthermore, sizable trees have been killed by those creeping Wisteria vines. When these large trees are killed, it opens the forest floor to sunlight, which allows the Wisteria seedlings to grow and flourish even more. 

Also, anyone who wants to see a good list of invasive species that are often sold at garden centers you should *definitely* avoid planting in your yard (depending on your zone), see [THIS LIST](http://imgur.com/a/PCLez) I made. If anyone DOES want to plant Wisteria, I would recommend [American Wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria_frutescens), which is just as beautiful, but does not have the invasive predisposition the Asian varieties do. The reason the Asian varieties are favored in ornamental application is because they emit a very intoxicating fragrance, while American Wisteria does not.

Edit: clarity

per /u/DonTago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2nvdjn/bonsai_wisteria/cmhi32q)
Reminds me of Flumes album cover 
They must cut that thing hourly. Wisteria grows stupid fast.
If I thought I had any chance of keeping one of those alive...

I kill everything indoors. The only things to survive me so far are snake plants. 
I ordered seeds for this on amazon. After a few weeks I got a notice that they had been confiscated.  

Edit:  I gave no indication of wanting to grow a bonsai with them. I'm aware seedlings aren't appropriate for bonsai. I did not know they were invasive when I tried to purchase them, now I do. 
Desperate Bonsais, Wisteria Lane. 
I totally used this photo as the basis for a kids painting class.
shoutout to /r/Bonsai 
I pass by some beautiful established Wisteria on my commute, can I guerilla garden this? Sneak in get a cutting and attempt to cultivate this? Any helpful tips appreciated.
very beautiful
It looks like a cheerleader with her hands thrown back.
It also keeps the demons confined to an area if you plant it as a barrier.
OMG where did you find this? Did you collect this in the wild or someone garden?
How can I cultivate something like this?

Looks like the art on Flumes skin album 
Looks like flowers on the new Flume - Skin LP album
Looks like that Flume album cover
Such beauty. Bonsai trees are such an art form. Nature at its best.
Where can I buy one NOW.
I want one but I'd kill it :(
Sounds like a Harry Potter spell.
How tall ?
It never ceases to amaze me how purdy bonsai trees are.

That's a skill I intend to learn at some point in life. 
Is it possible to do a jarcanda tree bonsai? Anyone? 
bonsai are so cool.

Okay Bill lets spend 5k on a movie room.

Okay how much should we spend on the tv?


Id like to keep it under 150.

"Welcome to Michael Scott Cinema."
And just what every media room needs, skylights right by the screen.
I see a projector screen.  I can assume there is also a projector.
From this day forward I will be replacing my oft-used phrase "useful as a screen door on a submarine" with "useful as skylights in a cinema room"... Hopefully my kids will finally see me as being 'hip', or 'the bomb'.
Even the screen above the TV doesn't look that big either...
I got a job at a hotel near Seatac. Outside, we had a huge banner hanging from the side of the building "HONEYMOON JACUZZI SUITES! FREE BOX OF CHOCOLATES AND BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE!" So we'd get these newlyweds coming in, and they were handed  a 3.16oz bottle of champagne, a four-piece box of cheap chocolates, and it wasn't a Jacuzzi hot tub, but a Jacuzzi bathtub. I didn't work there for very long because I refused to sell the package. We had one guy get so angry, he jumped the counter, grabbed a bunch of chocolates and bottles of champagne, and left with his bride. Didn't even stay at our hotel.  We all just stood back and watched and didn't call the police.

My Zune had a bigger screen.
Right but all the seats slide sideways so you can see the Dinosaurs hatching in the lab.
They pass out headphones to everyone for 5 dollars if you want to hear the movie 
sky lights?
Those candelabras put them way over budget
Is that really a cinema room?

I mean it has very nice seating, but that is about it.

The tv and the projector screen are rather small, there are skylights and these strange candles in the front. It might be some sort of stage or chapel or something. It looks more like some place where someone would give a sales pitch about some amazing multi-level marketing opportunity or a sermon about how much god wants you to give the preacher money.
http://i.imgur.com/GhFBRxh.gif
That is AWFUL. 

"Let's spend 10k building the room, but skimp on the screen."

Ridiculous
the skylights weren't a good choice either.
I see a pull down projector screen. Still doesn't look like a big enough projector screen but I bet there is a projector in there, or was at one point and they don't want to replace it. 
It's like that awesome Office episode where Michael has Pam and Jim for dinner. 
What is this, a cinema room for ants?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkdhJNe505E
...and make sure you install skylights over the TV so our guests can see it. 
lol did they try to simulate the airplane movie experience but slightly pimp it?
Is that not a projection screen right above the TV?
It does look like there is also a projector screen.

I've always enjoyed this clip of [Moe Howard on the Mike Douglas show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_METTgPnSWY) teaching pie throwing.  This was just a few years before he died in 1975 at the age of 77.
HELLOO

Curly Joe ain't my stooge. Only Shemp and Curly can be the magical number 3

Billy West (Futurama) does the greatest Larry Fine impression ever.  This is a bit he did on the Howard Stern Show:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i16VL-eSFnY

Can't believe no one has posted this yet nyuk nyuk nyuk

https://youtu.be/FKAfXdb5LsA
Didn't they all essentially die poor, because the studio, or producer, completely ripped them off?
Those poor guys didn't make squat off of their amazing work. Tom Bergeron was on Stern a few years ago talking about when he was really young he interviewed Larry and he paid him like 30 bucks. While he was interviewing him he mentioned Moe and Larry called Moe and told him the kid had 30 bucks for him so Moe drove there immediately. He said they lived in shoddy houses and Moe's car was an old broken down mess. The studios ripped those guys off, for just the amount of hours I've watched their shorts and movies, they deserve thousands of dollars.
Correction, two Stooges and Curly Joe. 
Shemp > Curly Joe
With his moustache shaved off, I can't even tell which one is Groucho...
Curly Howard, who had a stroke and had to stop performing (died 1952) was the real comic genius and creative leader.  They were still funny (Shemp Howard, Moe's other brother, was probably the best fill in) but the original Curly ones were a cut above.
is  Curly Joe?
Curly Joe doesnt count
Why you wise guy eh?  Knuck--Knuck--Knuck.  
I believe the fourth man in the picture is the singer/actor Al Martino.
Is that Johnny Fontane?
This picture is more likely from some point in the 60's than the 70's. Larry had a stroke in January 1970 from which he never fully recovered and the Stooges act was pretty much over after that. He looks far better in this photo than he does in anything I've seen of him post stroke.
Moe is Hitler.
Just how old *is* Colin Mochrie?

Now all we need is someone from reddit to draw Lisa utilizing all of the no's.
I just finished studying animation and even on our final student films the directors of each project were encouraged to make sheets like this. Our teams were really tiny, only 5 or 6 people a project, but when you have multiple people animating on a film, all with their own distinct styles and artistic background, it's pretty easy for inconsistencies to happen unless you really peg things down! 

Even in a small team like ours, the style guide basically became like our bible during the project, I can't imagine what it'd be like in larger teams, if style guides weren't there! I love seeing ones from other series though, some of the do's and don't's are really interesting, things you wouldn't notice/think about otherwise 
It takes a little while to hammer out all these kinks and standardize the art style across the animation team. If you want to see an example of some of these errors in play, check out the first season of Family Guy, there are a few errors, but one that immediately comes to mind is the cutaway where Peter thinks Philadelphia with Tom Hanks is a comedy. When the POV switches from zoomed out to closeup, someone didnt scale the eyes correctly, so for a part of the scene Peter's eyes are huge 
As an animator, seeing everyone's reaction to something that is super common in the industry is cool. It's like "oh ya, what I do is pretty cool"
I played around with the image to see what was written on the back. Here are my results (someone more skilled would do better):

Can someone draw a character with all the no-nos or as many as possible 
Really cool look into the life of an animator.
I spot a Slurms McKenzie smile
I find these rules also work in real life. For instance, top teeth don't move up and down when you talk. And when I smile really big, my lips cover my ears.
The completed eye-circle makes Lisa look stoned.
26 years and I just realized Lisa and Marge's faces (bottom right) are the same as the main characters (Sheba, Binky, Bongo) from the Life in Hell series.
Oh shit I remember seeing this in The Simpsons Magazine back in the early nineties when I was a kid.

Is this in Baton Rouge or Portugal. If it's in BR, i'd like to go see it in person
It's an impressive play on perspective. Here's his [official website](http://www.odeith.com/) in case you want to see more. 
And I'm just sitting here drawing stick figures. :|
I really want to see more shots of the art from the "wrong" angle, to get a better idea of how it's accomplished.  

I'm not a very good artist with cans & brushes, but I do have a wide format printer and I'd LOVE to employ this technique by "figuring it out" in photoshop, printing distorted images and applying them to wall's/floors to achieve the same effect! 
The signature looks a lot more deadly than the alligator.

That's not Portugal.  It's in Baton Rouge, LA.  I ride my bike by it all the time.  We had a big street street art expo and a bunch of famous graffiti artists came and did cool pieces.

It's not often I look at a picture and actually go audibly "WHOA!"  I did here.  Whoa.
I know I'm late to the comments, but I live in Baton Rouge and would love to hear where this piece is located. Any help?
Good thing he didn't do this in Singapore, otherwise that would be a paddlin'.
Does anyone know exactly where this is in BR?
Brain: Still processing.....
how is this possible? lol. I am shocked that someone is capable of doing this. kudos to the artist
The coolest thing about this to me isn't the image itself, it's that they spray painted the ground orange to make the reflection more convincing.  Clever.
Wow
They project the image intro the corner from something like an overhead projector, then traced that on the walls and colored it in.  If you look at it from the very spot the projector was, you see the illusion. If you are just a little to either side, taller or shorter,  you lose the effect.

If you want, you can soak a pinecone (or anything else flammable) in the solution, then let the alcohol evaporate (or not), and it will burn pretty green/blue too.

The only known copy of the 1905 Woods Electric Queens Victoria Brougham sells at auction for almost $100000  in Denmark 2015
When you realize 110 years ago didn't mean the 1800s :(
I did a project in high school and mentioned that electrical cars existed when cars were first coming out. Everyone including the teacher dismissed me and thought I was ignorant.. Worst public speaking event I've ever had and I was actually right in what I was talking about. 
Anyone else see this on James Mays car of the people the other day? 
We had one of these where I worked once. Blew my mind. Very cool, and I had no idea electric cars went back that far until that day. 
And it has the same range as a BMW i3
[Jay Leno has a similar car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhnjMdzGusc). Although his is actually a 1909 Baker. He also owns a [1914 Detroit Electric](https://transportevolved.com/2015/12/29/jay-leno-prepares-to-bring-100-year-old-electric-car-into-21st-century-with-help-of-modern-parts/) that he is upgrading with modern electric car tech.
I wonder how the battery technology was then. And how it has held up, if it hasn't been replaced

Out there somewhere is a smug bastard drinking a soy latte and driving 3.64MPH.  
There's a similar car in the museum in Campbell, CA.

The driver would sit in back on a sofa and steer with a lever,  while "guests" would use 2 backward facing seats.  The idea was that the riders would be able to chat while rolling along. 
Still cheaper than a tesla.
Where's the wheel?

What I like about magnets is that you can keep cut one in half, then cut those two pieces in half, over and over again, and each of those pieces will have a north and south "pole" after you cut it.

Fucking magnets, how do they work?
[Damn, OP. Is Reddit your full-time job?](https://www.reddit.com/user/Noerdy/submitted/)
Very attractive.
I don't know whether to be attracted, or repulsed.
I was a TA in high school for freshmen science. There was a girl who legitimately thought North direction was always the way she was facing forward. She stood up towards the front of the room and said "ok so this is north" then turned 90 degrees and asked "now this direction is north, right?" staring at the wall.
I love magnets! Definitely one of my favorite hobbies
I just did a project on this for school! We just followed the magnet where the arrow pointed, and drew the field lines. The aim was to find the null points, on the equitorial and axial lines. It was awesome.
I prefer the iron filings version:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/3fd6c184d2025cd378ef35baa14dd99728b42492.jpg
I hate 2-dimensional representations of 3-dimensional fields. Like that stupid gravity as a rubber sheet one. Give me a visualization of gravity sinking in 3-dimensions around the entire object, not just underneath it.
As a magnetic applications engineer (actual job title) this post makes me chuckle. Ferrofluid is pretty awesome too, but there's lots of good sim software for visualizing fields in 2d and 3d. There is a nice JavaScript website that lets you put poles and field densities and you can even make halbach arrays and see how they look with no background field or with a global gradient field,...

Damnit now I need to go look on my laptop for that link...

Edit: pretty sure this is it http://www.falstad.com/vector3dm/ hard to get Java working these days 
This confuses me. 
Magnetic lines of flux travel in parallel lines.

Magnetic lines of flux cannot cross.

Magnetic lines of flux exit and enter a magnet at right angles.
Wow that magnet is really fucking shit up.
Fun fact: the reason that the North part of the arrow on a compass points "North" is because this direction is actually Earth's magnetic South pole. Opposites attract.
All those compasses are fucked
I hated this lab in physics.

I volunteered in a hospice once in the Midwest. We had a tornado coming through and were supposed to move residents into a hallway. One oldtimer named Joe refused to go. He told me, "I'm 103 years old and I'm dying. What the hell is a motherfucker tornado going to do to me?" Cusswords are so awesome coming out of a 103 year old's mouth.

Edit: Obligatory gold edit! Thank you to whoever gilded me for my first time!! :)
I lost my grandma this morning unexpectedly. We were discussing last night what was one thing she had to do sooner than later. She wanted to lay on the beach and watch the 'hunks'
She was so funny. I'll miss her. 
This picture makes me happy! I'm glad she has people that care for her. 

Edit: My highest rated comment by FAR.
If you wanted I bet you could find someone to photoshop that bag off her knee - I dont mean to imply that it's bad, just if you wanted it gone I've seen some great photoshop jobs here on reddit. 

awesome picture tho, I hope she's currently as comfortable as possible. 
Good on you for doing this for your grandma OP, the smile on her face is proof how much she appreciates you doing this for her.

As a nurse I work with a lot of patients who are terminally ill and frequently I'll ask them what were the most memorable moments in their life. 9/10 times people will mention family or memorable moments like these. Never once have I had a patient mention money or personal possessions as the highlight of their life. It's the little things in life that matters, make them count.
The most simple pleasures of life can mean a lot to some. 
Doctor here. This is the way it should be. Dying with dignity versus the medical torture we sometimes use to prolong the inevitable. Love the joy on her face. Congratulations to her for a long life. 
This is such a touching pic.  It brought both tears to my eyes as well as happiness seeing that smile on her face.  She looks like the Grandma everyone would want around them.  Sending big hugs to you and your gram.
Wat.
When my uncle came home from hospital to die (he didn't want to stay in the hospice, so his wife and my mother cared for him during his final 3 weeks. His bed was set up in the sitting room, his view out the window was onto the mountain range in our area. He woke up to the sun rising every morning over it. During the day and in the evenings his bed was wheeled out into the kitchen so he could be there with his family and be beside the stove. He could lie there and look out the double doors onto the bay. The view from the kitchen over the bay is unbelievable, many people at the funeral in the house were amazed at it. 
Before his remains left the house to go to the church we faced him towards the sea one last time. Something I believe would have put a smile on his face. 
Happy wat
Fuck yeah grandson! Not only are you sharing that fantastic day with her, and making her final desires a reality, you are there. And her face shows the joy and wonder of the setting and experience with you! 

To this day I regret missing my stepfathers final days, due to work commitments and travel constraints. All in all bullshit rationalizations. I just missed his death by @ 6 hours. Regret not being there just to say goodbye, hold his hand and thank him for everything he was to me. So kudos, it's hard to watch it happen, but being there for our loved ones is soul work. It is our responsibility and great honor to help them pass from this world to...

Edit: For assumptions about OP's gender!
Is this San Diego?

As someone who works in SD in some palliative/ home hospice care settings please listen to me when I say

You're all doing the right thing for her. HOSPICE DOES NOT MEAN YOURE GIVING UP ON SOMEONE. 

Edit: a word
Her joy is breathtaking. I have never loved a photo as much as I love this one!
This totally looks like Laguna Beach. We need closure, op!
I hope you grandma goes peacefully, remembering wonderful moments like this one.
My G'ma knew her time was near and wouldn't my wedding so I made her her favourite dinner and proposed to my wife in front of her so she could be a part of our wedding

This made my heart smile
I love this so much. I'm a geriatric nurse and its sad the number of elderly people who don't have family or don't have family who care enough to do things like this for them. You guys are awesome :)
Op, was that wheelchair rented or how did you find it?  I may be trying to take my mother-in-law to see the beach for the first time next year and worry about her walking on the sand.

Thanks.

This needs to be the response to so many things that seek out media interest.
Reminds me of a line from The Thick Of It. "We're not The Independent. We can't just put a picture of a whale on the front page with the word "cruelty" below it. That's just fucking cheating".
Very respectable. Rather than use a still from the video like a lot of other news agencies are, deny IS their sadistic pleasure by not showing any image of their atrocity at all. 
Sadly, my first thought was "Holy fuck, that's an expensive page of ink".

But, as a designer myself, I realize it serves its purpose, so it's worth it.
Quite the classy move. A picture of the gruesome act would probably sell more papers but they chose to pay their respects instead and report the facts. 
Glad to see this. From what I read about the poor guy he really did seem to have a big heart and compassion for people in that region and for the independent to print this on this front page conveys that sentiment. 
1. I dont know the name of the killer.

2. Didnt even see a picture of him.

3. They didnt show the video.

This is everything they should avoid to do and they did. Instead i know who was killed and where my prayers should be going. I like this, other news magazines should write down some notes.
i think this is getting more of a reaction...which is what the papers wanted anyway.
The Indie has a grand history of great front pages. David Kelly's death was particularly spectacularly well done as I recall.
ISIS guy 1: dude, you know what we can do to get people in our side?


ISIS guy 2: I dunno.


ISIS guy 1: We find an innocent man who is out helping people, and KILL him.


ISIS guy 2: You are so smart.


The fucking logic is non existent.
I feel this almost gives it a power in itself.

I still respect the independent for doing this.
Is the condemnation of propaganda just anti-propaganda propaganda?
Btw - if I ever get my head chopped off by crazy ANYONE... dont be scared. Be REALLY, REALLY mad... and drop MORE bombs.
What happened?
I'm completely taken aback by this. I've never seen a paper be so bold in a statement.
Today, my brother died. Not from anything this dramatic. But from an unexpected heart attack. I have no words. Or reason. But I know my big brother would've hated everything to do with bigotry. Racism. And overall revulsion of another race via biggoted views.  

You're all fabulous people, my brother was an artist, poet and writer who wrestled his demons daily... as we all do, we can all see the overall view here I'm sure... be excellent to each other and rase a glass.
#EPICFAIL A Loser's Guide to Social Media.

Wow, really poignant. 
Could have been so much more poignant were it not for the 30% top of page ads.
Should have used a helllo kitty background.
Are they implying they don't carry propaganda? 
That's a lot of black ink.
Any newspaper that claims it's not printing propaganda is definitely printing propaganda.
I feel like "#EpicFail - A loser's guide to social media" probably shouldn't be placed directly above this.
I think an all black front with no advertisements at the top would have been more effective. 
The shit at the top really cheapens this.

Not to spoil this (admittedly) beautiful picture, but keep in mind that these are often achieved with either sedated or dead animals bound to sticks, stiffened with glue or drugged or whatever.

Such a strong image of change - unrelenting and irrevocable.

I see this every day when I look in the mirror and there is no longer a young healthy 21 year old looking back at me.  I'm 54 now.  When I was 21 I was immortal.  At 54 I can now sense that I am not.  Unrelenting and irrevocable.  Time sucks.
I went to school here! That building just past the road on the left.
It's not all bad though, the area is being regenerated and there's new housing and a new school now.
It's a great shame to see communities like this lost from towns and cities across England but unfortunately it's a result of the times we live in. 

I live in Liverpool City centre and a comparison of the city centre 39 years ago and how it is today would produce an equally surprising yet positive contrasting image. The city Centre is amazing and is a credit to the hard work done by Liverpool City council.

As demands and cultures change some areas are lost to history whilst others flourish and grow.

Nice try, Wyle E. Coyote, but the roadrunner will just run straight through the picture.

Yes, one freshly baked loaf of art please.
As someone who knows nothing of glass art, how long did this take to make?
so you buy one slice for 5k then slice it in half and profit 5k? 
it's so early, i didn't notice it was detailed art.  i thought it was just splotchy colors and wondered why the fuck someone would pay 5 grand for a slice.

very impressive.
Here's a How it's Made that gives you an idea what kind of process is needed to make something like this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXtCqI-iMJ4

[Loren Stump's website](http://www.stumpchuck.com/)

More mind-blowing glass at /r/glassheads
But people wouldn't believe you if you told them that it's actually part of a bigger loaf unless you show them a photo of it. They'll just think it's some lame souvenir shop pendant.
I can't even comprehend how the artist was able to do this so perfectly. Really cool piece of art.
[deleted]
SO DARK THE CON OF MAN

Edit: And if you want to compare the glasswork to the original:

http://i.imgur.com/SHUEeBq.jpg
"each slice sold for $5000? Jesus, it's just glass! Slap an art tag on a pile of shit and I could sell it I bet!"

*opens link*

"oh.. Yeah, 5k sounds fair."
Every time I read a description about an art form I always think- "cool something for me to try"
I have to pretend I never saw this now
Professional glass artist here. This is how it's made:

The artist will pull very long strands of glass in all the colors that required for the picture he wants to make. They then arrange the long strands of glass into say a face or a foot or something. then melt them all together and pull that very long again. Then you can take the face you made and add that 'face' strand to a whole bunch of other strands to make an overall picture.

tldr: it's just like using one pixel at a time to make up the whole image.
[deleted]
Yeah yeah yeah that's real neat and all but you can't even smoke weed out of it.  
Fantastic stuff! I love this.
Cut it thin
Is there a discount for the end piece?
how do they slice this?
Calling these things slices makes me want to eat one.
If you're interested in glass art, there are two really good subreddits for it. /r/glassheads and /r/lampwork are both full of amazing glass art, artisits, and a copious amount of knowledgeable people in the art.
In the future, the one who can collect all the pieces and join them together will be granted a wish. Glassloaf Z!
When you slice the loaf, you can make a Strata-cut animation. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH42WFUNwfY) is an example.

Edit: Haha, though typically done with clay, not glass.
MACA!

Intentionally wavy? Interesting.
Note to self: find a desert map for Cities Skyline.
Those look to be the upper middle class suburbs, they tend to be on the outskirts of Vegas away from the strip since they overlook the desert mountains. High schools get built onto empty dirt lots and homes surround the area. Unfortunately, most of these homes get built around the outer edges more and more each year with less and less people buying them out. I'm only 23 and most of my friends have been able to *buy* these homes at this age from how cheap they are. I'm a Vegas Native and I can safely say this is only a specific view of suburban Vegas life. I'd even say Vegas has many different kinds of suburban looks since the city keeps growing immensely every year.

*edit from mobile* so thanks to savvy Vegas friends below this has been identified as the Aliante portion of Vegas, which is definitely a way nicer suburb of Vegas. I didn't meant to imply that these homes are foreclosing, but lots of neighborhoods that look like this one nearby are affordable to younger folks like me. 
Looks like future mars.
Nuketown

Made of ticky tacky.
Question for those that have lived in Vegas.

 In my many trips to Vegas I've noticed that most of the neighborhoods have brick walls built around them, why is that?
Reminds me of "The Goldfinch".  
[deleted]
Lots of comments from people saying Vegas sucks. I've been out here 10 years. It's fine. Every city sucks if you're looking for reasons for it to. It's just like any other place. Many of the complaints apply to any major city. Drivers suck, drug problems, crime, people are "fake" blah blah blah. I don't drink, do drugs, party, etc anymore. I have a decent career and life out here in this "party town". It's all about how you look at it. I think the desert is beautiful. Yeah, it gets hot as hell. It's a desert. We also don't have to shovel snow. This winter was cold for like a week in late December. Other than that, nothing more than a light jacket was ever needed. 

All of that being said, don't raise kids here unless you can put them in private school. Clark County schools are atrocious. Even if they graduate high school (~30% won't), the curriculum is so weak that they will still be at a disadvantage. Especially in an out of state university.

I have desert landscaping. Grass is dumb in the desert. Even outside of being a waste of water and contributing to the humidity, it just doesn't look right in the middle of the desert. I sure as shit don't want to be outside cutting the grass when it's 115 degrees out.
This looks exactly like the homes in Las Ventura's in San Andreas in GTA: San Andreas.
I live there. AMA
I live in a similar neighborhood on the south west end of Las Vegas.  It's kind of nice and weird knowing that across the street there is literally nothing but desert for hundreds of miles.

fuck i belong in vegas. I'm a dirt bike freak, trails are hard to come by in Toronto, Canada... 
Ah, this picture reeks of corporate interests and government unwillingness to stand up against the corporations. Notice how the colour of the area outside the suburbs is faded, signifying the death throes of Mother Nature herself. The grey, uniform tops of the houses signify the victory of the corporate agenda and the defeat of the common person, who is now powerless to stop the overreach of the 1%.
Looks just like my sim city. 
If you've got a good set of illegal binoculars, you can even see those dastardly fools over in Desert Bluffs.
This is right next to Shadow Ridge High School. I bought my car from a guy near here.
Reddit is weird. Space colonies are the future but trying to live in the desert is arrogant and unsustainable.
Ahh a good case study for gridding in Cities Skyline.
Honestly this does not look so bad.

I would rather grow up there than my own city.

Imagine being an 8-14 year old kid there with a giant desert behind your house to explore, build bike trails, jumps and just wander.

also there is an airport near on the bottom left corner to watch planes land and take off.

Then at 16 with a summer job and saving up allowances I'd get a small dirtbike to tour around in the desert.

Seriously, this place looks 10x better than growing up in other cities where you are locked in on 4 sides with shitty bylaws setup by old women city councilors.


Wow i got my subreddits mixed up, I thought this was a picture from /r/CitiesSkylines

Wheres the vicious alligators, piranhas, or jellyfish? Do you even know how to moat?
That's not HOA approved. 
I have a yard project to do now.
My City is offering something like a $2500 credit to build a rain garden right now.  I've seen some neighbors do it,  and it's pretty cool.  Might be adding it to my summer projects.
I am a bit lost. This  looks like it is diverting the water to another location the property. Wouldn't this be using landscaping to your advantage?

Or is the water really being trapped there and supplying the lawn?
In school for Landscape architecture here. I cant tell whats going on at the other end of this, but from this vantage point it just diverts water directly to the street. Using the rain water on site requires detention time. This image https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0b/f6/13/0bf6132c82091cf393b96dfa55dfe5c9.jpg has an exaggerated vertical scale, but it shows that water is retained by small weirs, that create micro basins, rather than just diverting water flow.
Portland?
It's called a rain garden. Source: I'm from Seattle, they're a thing.
Greenest grass I've ever seen
now take a picture on a normal dry sunny day...

Damn. You made the rain your bitch.
Channel it to a neighbors yard? ;)
Unless you live in Colorado. 
Nice!  Do you have more pics?
That is a great idea! Now do mine.
Cool! Where in California is this again?
Nice mosquito trench.
It looks a bit like a rain garden. The function of a rain garden is to increase infiltration rates and prevent runoff. They can also act to filter out pollutants. It's hard to tell by this angle but it looks like the intent is not to just run water from the downspouts to the pavement. 

Overall I like it. It probably helps reduce runoff and increase water infiltration. We should all build these in our yards to improve the water quality of our streams and rivers. Could use more deep rooted plants in it to make it better. 

Also as a side note, the city I live in will reimburse half the costs of a rain garden up to a certain amount. I bet many other towns do the same and few people know it. 
This looks awesome and yes it is the oldest method of irrigation! 
Am I the only person that thinks the pipe looks like an upside down bendy straw?
Y'all have them cool porches I like. What state is this?
Very beautiful. Thank you for the share gave me some ideas. Just wished it rained more in California. 

Nice way to do so.
Omg that is beautiful!  I'm stealing this.  It's mine now.
I collect mine in barrels and pour them on the gardens as needed.  Of course, when they are full, the gardens are wet, and when the gardens are dry, the barrels are usually empty.

One of the things that sticks with me about Amsterdam is just how easy it is to get lost. Loads of the streets and roads seem to be straight when you're on them but actually curve. 

I kept thinking I knew roughly where I was only to find out I was totally wrong and I have a pretty good sense of direction. It's now turned into a thing I do when I'm there because I found so many cool places I would never have seen otherwise.

If it would have been filmed by a discovery channel crew, she would be dead because that's what mother nature has choose for her.

Humans always gotta intervene. Just let nature do what nature does. 

Sometimes the lion wins sometimes the buffalo wins. Simple as that. 
I'd love to know what the animal is thinking during/after this.  It has a large hole in its side one minute, then a quick nap later it's patched up. 

Is the animal aware that it is a/the human which helped it? Is it aware that it's life was saved? Can it see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?

I'd like to give the clean shaven gentlemen an opportunity to get their debating beards from backstage...
 Some of our best politicians wouldn't be elected today because voters somehow confuse looking like a respectable politician with actually being a respectable politician.
make fun of it all you want, but we do just fine without the fake idiots who can barely pull off pretending to care about what the people want/need. somehow, even with all the crazies, we do pretty well. we're a pretty progressive place, have the first city powered entirely from renewable resources, and we're pretty decent as far as civil liberties go. i think most other state debates are much more of a joke, even though the people look more serious. 
Looks about right for a VT gubernatorial race.  From left to right:  Jerry Garcia in hiding, rich woman there to look at leaves, career politician, guy who moved to VT for gun rights, another career politician, housewife with no practical experience who thinks they need to get the "Washington insiders" out of Montpelier, and a car salesman.

"Kaleb Whitby, 27, who miraculously escaped with minor injuries, was sandwiched in his pickup truck between two trailers in the Baker City crash. The photographer, Sergi Karplyuk, helped the man out of his car. Whitby's injuries only required two band-aids and ice. Photo by Sergi Karplyuk"

Key quote: "Karplyuk asked Whitby if he could snap a picture of his steel sandwich, the farmer looking sideways at the camera with remarkable calm."
"Thank God that I'm still alive," Whitby said. "Now I've got to go figure out why."


Somehow that line really struck a chord with me. You never know how much you have until you almost lose it all. 
ITT: People expect a random bystander to cut this guy out somehow. What else can a person do other than take a pic and wait for the proper authorities?

My prediction is someone will photoshop an angel standing in front with it's arms out pushing each semi to save him. It will be reposted to facebook next week and my mom will show it to me next month. 
Can anyone figure out how he got in that position? Perpendicular to two parallel semis? 
As a former firefighter I have seen people live through much worse. I don't have pictures to prove it but it is weird how some people can survive crazy shit. The majority of them where not in great shape but they did live.

The one that I remember most though is a drunk that hit a mini-van head on. This was back in 1989 and the guys head punched through the windshield. The Sgt. went to support his neck and his fingers slid inside his throat. Took us all back for a few seconds and then we went back to the rescue.

Once we removed the dash both of his legs where facing towards his torso and through all this, he was breathing. Not with it, but alive.

He survived though.

Does anyone else find it unsettling that there is a skull like face embedded into the crumpled frame just to the right of his face?!
So this is actually my cousin, just got off the phone with him. He was coming back from a business trip in Oregon (he's a farmer in Washington) when this happened. According to him there semis in front of him hit black ice, and he then slid into them, crushing him like this. His airbag didn't go off (luckily) and he said he had about 1 ft. of room to move around in. He was able to get out of the car after about 30 minutes. Although he says he only has a couple cuts and a bruise near his eye, he did go to the hospital where he was checked out and everything was fine. He's now happy to be home with his son and pregnant wife. If anyone has any questions about what happened let me know and I can forward them off to him.

["Negro tenant farmer, rehabilitation client. Jefferson County, Kansas", 1938.](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1997003700/PP/)


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration):


>Initially created as the Resettlement Administration (RA) in 1935 as part of the New Deal in the United States, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was an effort during the Depression to combat American rural poverty.


>The FSA stressed "rural rehabilitation" efforts to improve the lifestyle of sharecroppers, tenants, very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture  that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.

Jefferson County, KS has an average annual rainfall of ~38 inches. In 1938, they got 10.5". I seriously doubt it was this green. It was called the "dustbowl" for a reason.
