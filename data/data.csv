He died protecting priceless antiquities from destruction, something he definitely believed in.  Sad for him to die but certainly honorable for him to die with his convictions.The man was 82 years old and brave as fuck. RIP.This is so heartbreaking. His love for the Palmyra Antiquities surpassed his love for his own life.

I hope that wherever he goes, he's rolling in antiquities and unbelievable treasures.  Here's a story. 

The New York Times: ISIS Beheads Syrian Antiquities Scholar. http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5JqtgyU...why can't the entire world be more successful against ISIS... the news about them is always so frustrating and infuriatingIt breaks my heart so much history is being destroyed. Especially since that area (Iraq, Iran, etc) is literally like the cradle of civilization and there's SO MUCH priceless stuff there. It's truly a terrible thing.When you feel threatened by ancient monuments, dead gods and archeologists, you're in the wrong and so is your ideology.[This is Tomislav Salopek, 31, father of two, Croatian] (http://static.klix.ba/media/images/vijesti/b_150813104.jpg), beheaded by ISIS a week ago, because, well, ISIS likes to behead peopleRIP Khaled Assad. You died a more honorable man than those who killed you. Thank you khaled. You're a hero to history.Most news stories failed to say why he was murdered. The man was a hero who sacrificed himself to protect his lifetime of work. 

It's long passed time for the surrounding Muslim countries, who have millions of soldiers in their armies, to come together and put an end to these monsters once and for all.  I know Isis are shitheads but why do they destroy ancient buildings and antiques?R.I.P. man of ethics and morality.Perhaps some of the powerful sovereigns in regions **SHOULD STEP THE FUCK UP** and save their culture and history before it's wiped out by these assholes.


It's hard for me to be upset about this anymore.

I'm absolutely shocked at the loss of priceless history and the barbarism to kill this man over this, but if no one in the Middle East wants to stop ISIS, then I say the West should pull out, and let them have their cake.

There's no way we, with a foreign modern military, can go into a region like the Middle East and solve these problems by killing people.

Our foreign military can support and assist in a force led by a local sovereign, but we cannot lead a war over there and come out the winner, nor accomplish anything effective.

People have the right to self determination. If those people in the territory now controlled by ISIS, and those sovereigns around them want to allow ISIS sovereign control, so be it.**NEW GAME:** No more need to hunt and kill secondary game like lions and rhinos.  It's time to drop all of the poachers into ISIS territory armed to the teeth and wearing GoPros with instructions to bring back their heads as trophies.  Poach for your life baby!Fuck You ISIS!Wow.

RIP.As a historian I am really feeling that it is time for us to organize and begin seriously defending these sites. This man died with honor. I hope he finds peace. Will somebody plz take out those piece of shit fucktards? I hope if I ever face my own death like that I can have half the balls this guy did and tell them fuck right off. This guy is a hero and died as honorable a death as any man could hope for, die protecting and defending what you love and lived for.I was talking with a lot of redditors yesterday trying to understand how ISIS is able to recruit and hold so much control if seemingly no one supports them. 

The common answer from Muslims was that ""more Muslims support ISIS than are willing to admit it publicly"".  And that ""even if they don't actively support them, they tacitly support them by secretly agreeing with their actions"". 

That was concerning to me, and as much as I hate to agree with GW Bush, I can kind of start to see the logic of his ""If you aren't with us, you're against us"" comment. 

Seeing people like this man, get beheaded for such a noble cause kind of highlights for me how terribly evil this group is.  If you even *remotely* support what these people are doing, fuck you. 

This truly is a point in time where everyone needs to clearly pick a side. This is the kind of shit that we as a society can't tolerate. I guess real life is not like a movie. I wonder if he spent his last seconds wondering if someone would come to save him. I hate when good people have to die like this. fucking savages

RIP, real manAlpha as Fuck. ISIS - Tell us where you have the shit hid. Kahled - Fuck You.
I hope that I would have the Balls to protect my life's work.It's tragic that it often takes such villains to show us who the heroes are. ","[0.918273, 0.067216, 0.812126, 0.044554, 0.055146, 0.0, 0.0, 0.472, 0.137, 0.028, 0.895, 0.627, 0.923]"

    Just who do you think you are to try to briibe me into an appearance on your
    'thing' with this gift of the most fantastic Cornona Silent typewriter made in 1934?

    You are out of your minds if you think... that I... wow, this thing has great action...

http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/nerdist-podcast-tom-hanks/Tom's episode of the podcast was one of the best in recent memory. Nothing will top the Henry Rollins episode, though. That shit was a revelation.Not sure if this was it, but in case I'm not the only one curious about what the [typewriter](https://www.smithcorona.com/blog/smith-corona-virtual-typewriter-museum/post-merger-office-machines-interwar-period/) looked like.Awesome post, but just curious... how in the hell does this have over 10,000 *net* upvotes??? The most I've ever seen is like, maybe 3000 or 4000, and generally the top posts on the front page have about 2000, right? Isn't there some sort of algorithm that balances out ridiculous amounts of upvotes with downvotes or something?That is classy sir. Straight up Classy.Im not even going to whore my username for karma, I just want to say Tom Hanks is the greatest American Actor to ever live.
We should print his face on money.Looks like your invitation was just his type.I call Shenanigans: That signature clearly says ""Tom Hanly"".

""No, they think it's a one-way mirror, which makes them less creeped out for some reason""

I have similar windows right next to my desk, every day a female cardinal lands on the window sill and looks at herself for several minutes, sometimes pecking at her image.  Usually the male eventually sees her and starts singing at her until she turns and they fly off.   I always imagine him yelling ""C'mon, you look fine!, We have to go, we're going to be late!""
We never got deer, but we definitely got a lot of people stopping to fix their hair, a few fixing makeup and one muscly asian guy who danced while staring at himself for about five minutes.

Probably the best and cruelest use of it was gluing a coin to the pavement.They suck when geese or swans nest by them, the dumb things see their reflections and think that it's a rival, and peck at the windows.

He would peck his reflection for hours and hours every day for weeks.My grandparents used to have a house in Tucson with one-way windows. Every morning we would wake up to a family of quails banging their heads against the window, I assume to beat up the other, identical family of quails who were invading their turf.

Quails are not so smart.[deleted]I worked in my university's print shop full-time, sweet deal, free tuition and they let me leave for three hours each day, with pay, to attend one class plus I was on campus for the evening class as well.  Anyway, our print shop was mostly underground but had these windows where you could look up to the sidewalk.  There was a railing just above and a lot of students would lean on the railing.  I had six student aides working for me and Jesus Christ did they ever stare up the skirts through that window all damn day.  I never did because I'm just not that type of guy.  I ended up taping cardboard over the windows between semesters so the next batch of aides didn't know any better, but sure enough those guys had already heard about the perk and tore down my cardboard.Expected two hobos fucking.  Was pleasantly surprised.Its great until someone stores their dildo against the window.That ain't no deer I ever seen. Where is this?

EDIT: First video taken down, [here is the video i was talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbvZNy7Bmw)I worry more about airborne debris than I do about a pressure wave.    My dad was a maintenance foreman at a refinery for many years.  They had just got on site when a grain elevator about 3/4 mile away exploded.  Not your normal little sheet metal silo, but a huge concrete structure on the ship channel.  They saw it go and could feel the heat on their skin.  One of dad's crew yelled ""Take cover!"" and they scuttled behind the cracking tower they were going to work on that day.  Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet.How deep does it go?So does anyone know why caused that massive explosion? Knowing my luck, i bet those tar filters i ordered from China last week were in one of those shipping containers.Only 50 people died? How many were vaporized?is there a before picture?That was the largest explosion I've seen that isn't a nuke.  I don't even think a MOAB is that big.To give you another unbelievable indication of the explosions scale, here is a ""before"" picture of the exact area affected from Google Earth.  The red circle is the now water-filled crater, the yellow is the area substantially destroyed by the blast.

http://i.imgur.com/JvmXti5.jpg

It kind of looks like the crater is filled with water --does anyone know? It's difficult to see the depth of the crater.Thank God the explosion happened in that giant craterIs that how it's going to be remembered from now on?  The Tianjin Crater.  Just level the ground around it and abandon the land or turn it into a park of something.  

I lived close by to a massive explosion that happened in Quebec.  [The McMasterville Explosion 1975](http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/faits_divers/clips/12049/).  That too made a huge crater in the ground and levelled an entire factory complex that belonged to CIL.  The remaining factory was demolished and scrapped.  [You can see for yourself the land has been abandoned to this very day.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/McMasterville,+QC/@45.5403273,-73.2314636,720m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cc9aa8c356f3055:0xadd1c7a969a383e4!6m1!1e1)  It's not a farm, the land is too saturated with chemical toxins.  It's not a dump because the toxins make it too dangerous to work in.  It's just fenced off abandoned land.    This is a [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&rem=&zm=15) to the ever-useful ""NukeMap"" website that shows the estimated crater and fireball size for a 3kT blast at the site.  

Same [test](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&fallout=1&zm=15), but with the fallout and radiation settings on.   

Edit:  Here is a third [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=0.02&lat=39.0388145&lng=117.7362823&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&casualties=1&humanitarian=1&rem=&zm=18), this time with a blast setting of 0.02kT, which I am being told is the more accurate value than the 3kT value that I grabbed from earlier in this thread.   (NukeMap uses google API, so you can switch to satellelite view and drag the point of impact around to compare.)It really does look like the aftermath of some type of nuclear fallout. Scary stuff.from Wikipedia:

>Chinese state media reported that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics,[5] a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.[3]

 

>The first to respond to the fire were unable to keep it from spreading. The Global Times reported that firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water, as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in chain more violent chemical reactions.

would love to swing again without my feet hitting the floor.I'm from Bogotá, Colombia, and this happened in my city. :) I like to think that this is more than just a few garbagemen taking a break at the swing set. I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. ""I'm afraid of swings"" he responds. ""Why"" his friend asks, ""did you have an accident while you were young?"" ""No!"" he exclaimed, ""I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing"". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, ""look how high I can go!"". 

Did that happen? probably not. 
Was there any point to that story? Nope!
 But did you read it? Well, only *you* can answer that question!Why am I only seeing Luigis?I always try to do this when I pass by a park.

So, I'm a huge Lego nerd, and I'm drunk. Drunk enough to open a sealed set I have from 1981 to see if there was anything like this in that set.
  
There wasn't. There was a note to parents, but it didn't express anything about gender.
  
But it was cool to see these Legos that haven't been opened since 1981. I mean shit, I was 2-3 when this was on store shelves. The brick walls are thicker than they are today. But the sets today are better by far. AND SPCAE LEGO!!! Shit, that brings me back. I mean, my whole Lego room brings me back, but to see ads in the booklet brings me back.
  
You motherfuckers want proof??? Here's the opened. box.

And you know what? Who gives a shit? When I have the privilege of having kids, Ima teach them to do whatever the fuck they want, but they gotta learn both jobs. My girls will know how to change a tire, and my boys will know how to make bathrooms smell like lemons. Pink Lego, boy Lego, fuck it! Boys play with Barbies, girls play with GI Joe, I'll make fun of them for playing with lame toys, not for playing with the wrong gender toy.
  
The fucking Danish got it right with Lego, and Danishes, and they're right. Who gives a fuck?! Maybe they thought by 1981, when this set was made, that they didn't need to insert pamphlets telling parents to not be assholes. Because rthe Danish weren't assholes in 1981.
  
Lego rules. Build whatever the fuck you wanna build, and don't be a dick parent telling your kids what to build. Fuck you and your dying asshole ways. WHO WANTS TO COME OVER AND DRINK AND BUILD WHATEVER THE FUCK??!?!?!!?
  
edit: you want more pictures of the box? just ask. I'll be up for a while.
  
EDIT: Okay, now I'm awake and sober, and can asses what I have done. The set isn't really that valuable, and I got it as part of a massive 390 set haul last year. I kept it for its historical value. The pieces are bagged in the perforated bags from back in the day, and they make that distinctive sound when you shake them. I love that sound. All I did was cut one of the seals to open it, and I don't regret it. This set is a time capsule and should be opened to see that booklet.
  
EDIT: The pictures of my Lego room were pretty old. Here's my room as of today. http://imgur.com/a/MrlX1[A helpful guide to picking out toys for kids](http://i.imgur.com/tcCnOdV.jpg).SPACESHIP?!??!!??Wish my parents had gotten this memo.  :(  All I wanted was legos and hot wheels and all I got were barbies.Source, but in German:

This is an English version of the 1974 German pamphlet found [here](http://www.redshift.com/~shifflett/lego/German_catalog_1974/). The English cover with the blonde girl can be seen [here](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?C=c74ukhom). The blurry numbers on the bottom match: 97880-Eng. This seems to be associated with the 1970s Lego Homemaker sets, which were Lego's first sets aimed at girls.

Other details: Although the matching German page is the third photo in the link, the position of the staple [confirms it is the back page](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2n1t47/70s_lego_had_the_right_idea/cm9o9wi?context=3). I am still unsure of the ""white house"" that OP mentioned, but perhaps he can corroborate the rest of this.

Edit to add: I found the [Portuguese version](https://plus.google.com/photos/+Blastemes/albums/5668495571434629281?banner=pwa), with [relevant translation of the ""To Parents"" letter.](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/a%20necessidade%20de%20criar%20e%20igualmente%20forte%20em%20todas%20criancas.%20rapazes%20ou%20raparigas.%20o%20que%20interessa%20e%20a%20imaginacao.%20a%20habilidade%20e%20a%20tecnica%20nao%20contam.%20Pode-se%20construir%20o%20que%20se%20tem%20na%20ideia.%20uma%20cama%20ou%20em%20camiao.%20uma%20casa%20de%20boneca%20ou%20uma%20nave%20espacial.%20%0A%0AMuitos%20rapazs%20preferem%20as%20casas%20de%20boneca.%20no%20fim%20de%20contas%20ha%20mais%20pessoas%20do%20que%20astronautas.%20uma%20boa%20parte%20das%20meninas%20prefere%20as%20naves%20espaciais.%20Sao%20mais%20excitantes%20do%20que%20as%20cases%20do%20boneca.%20O%20importante%20e%20porlhes%20ao%20alcance%20o%20material%20exacto.%20so%20assim%20elas%20poderao%20criar.) 
Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this. A Lego designer explains how the company survived: http://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1x6ldp/lego_franchise_infographic/cf8vdl3

Edit: You know, I'm really tired of older former Lego builders claiming Lego didn't produce pre-packaged sets with instructions in ""the good old days."" Unless your ""good old days"" were prior to 1978, those sets you sniff at, the ones that told you how to build spaceships with special parts? They were around: http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/year-1978 

Edit 2: Corrected the first link. http://i.imgur.com/afnTUMC.gifThis sucks balls. I tried to enter a Lego building competition at a local mall. I was a skinny little kid with long blonde hair. They told me that ""girls weren't allowed to enter"". I'm still emotionally damaged from that one, cos I was a Lego master.I'm a girl...and I wanted pink Legos. Why didn't they have pink Legos when I was a kid? Why is that so hard? Can anyone else make out what's written [on the back of the sheet](http://i.imgur.com/y5yLayE.png)?  

All I can make out is:

You're standing in an active minefield and you decide to take a picture for karma?!Not saying it must be the case, but to me it feels like someone just created this himself, but to put a more weight on his moral message he's claiming it's official message from Lego.

We got on the train, and all fell asleep pretty quickly. I was first to wake up and I was quick to notice that although we were still moving, it was very slow and dark. I looked out the window and down the train, and to my amazement the fucking train was being put into a big cruise ship. I quickly nudged my buddies awake, and as any engineering major would do, they all instantly sprung an infrastructure boner. We were flabbergasted. Our train is going into a boat this is insane. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any cooler, they let everyone out of the train to walk around the ship, grab a bite to eat, have a cigarette and stretch your legs. The best part though, was hitting the duty free shop and getting a bunch of booze for the rest of the trip. I don't know if that's a normal mode of transportation in Europe or even in the U.S. but it was the first time I had seen it and I was blown away.In addition to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel already described, the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel also has the same configuration.  Here's a picture of it [EDIT: actually, with thanks to /u/chasetwisters for the clarification, a picture of its next-door neighbor bridge-tunnel the MMBT, see below for the real image].

""Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridge–tunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels.""

So, if you like these, and you live in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area, you have your choice of two [EDIT: or, really, three] bridge-tunnels.

I caused the death of spider today and I've not been able to shake the whole ordeal from my head.

You see, I was driving in my car and I see something in my peripheral vision. It's a huge golden orb-weaver. A BANANA SPIDER! He's on my window, the inside, and he's looking at me and I'm looking at him and the cop behind me is looking at both of us and wondering why I'm not driving because the light is now green.

I rolled down my window but that didn't do any good. Spider just hopped down to my arm rest. Too close for comfort. I open my door a little bit but Spider can't take a hint.

WHOOP WHOOOOOOP. The cop is now pulling us over. I turn into a near by parking lot, spider clumsily bolts out of my car via the rolled down window, officer approaches my vehicle and says ""What're you doing, son?!"", I hear a crunch.

The Caiyuanba Bridge is an arch bridge which crosses the Yangtze River in Chongqing, China. Completed in 2007, the arch spans 420 metres (1,380 ft) ranking among the longest arch bridges in the world. The bridges carries 6 lanes of traffic and two track of Chongqing Rail Transit Line 3 between the Nan'an District south of the Yangtze River and the Yuzhong District to the north.

Greek student here. If anyone's interested, here's who they are. I should note, however, that the separate divisions of the muses weren't agreed upon till the end of antiquity.

In the center is Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. I'm assuming she's in the middle because they considered epic the highest poetic genre. Below her in the bottom right corner, Cleo, the muse of history. To the left, Urania, muse of astronomy. Then Polyhymnia, the muse of sacred poetry. Then Erato, muse of lyric poetry, specifically love poetry (her name is related to the word ""erotic""). Then Terpsichore, muse of dance and the chorus. Then Melpomene, muse of tragedy. Then Thalia, muse of comedy.  Then Euterpe, muse of elegiac poetry.
It looks like it was buried under white pumice from a volcanic eruption.

>The ancient city of Zeugma was originally founded as a Greek settlement by Seleucus I Nicator, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, in 300 BC. The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000 inhabitants.

http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/11/11/mosaics-revealed-at-ancient-greek-city-of-zeugma-in-turkey/I'm surprised by all the sediment/ (for the lack of a better word) stuff that ended up on top of it over the years. Although I know 2,000 years, plus or minus half a millennium, is a lot of time for the accumulation of sediment/stuff to take place, I didn't realize several feet/ meters could pile up that fast. [Touched it up a bit.](http://imgur.com/Z4SbgUO)It makes me so happy to know there are still things in the world to be discovered.I was excited when i tore up a carpet and found a hardwood floor. Now i know that was bush league.Wow, can't imagine the feeling you must get discovering this yourself. HOW CAN IT BE GREEK IF ITS IN TURKEY IM ONTO YOU LIBERALS DONT TRY TO PLAY ME I KNEW A MAPPLEASE dont let ISIS find it...

Edit: ok, folks, I'm not a novice when it comes to geography, history and current events.   I said that because ISIS is right across the border on Syria, and heaven forbid, they make their way into Turkey somehow.   We see Russians in the Ukraine so why is spillover totally impossible?  I mean no offense to Muslims in general, but ISIS has history of destroying works of art, monuments and historical sites in towns it makes a home in.   Man, reddit, you are fickle and easy to insult a total stranger.   First time I've been called a ""knuckle dragging mouth breather"".

Edit #2:  Alright, let me justify the comment/joke behind what I said.  Current (2 week old information) shows that [ISIS holds the boarder area of Turkey in Syria and the northern end of Iraq.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0).  [That's about 25 miles/40 km](http://imgur.com/E1PqDqE) to the site where that mosaic is being uncovered...Not really far.  Of course its a stretch to say ISIS will invade Turkey anytime soon.  But sheesh man, they're right there at the doorstep.  Chill out people.This will probably get buried but I work for the Biblical Archaeology Society and we did a short piece on this last week. This is from Zeugma, an ancient trading center that was the only point traders and travelers could cross the Euphrates. The name literally means ""bridge"". In the 90s turkey built a dam farther down the river and submerged 30% of the site underwater. They've been excavating since 2000 and this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. I think it's worth pointing out that these mosaics actually date to the 2nd or 3rd cent. A.D., so at a glance, they are about 1,750 to 1,850 years old, rather than 2,200, as has been reported in the media.
([Here is a good source](http://www.ccaroma.org/en/zeugma-conservation-mosaics) for more reliable info, if anyone's interested.)

There were definitely some very stunning and intricate polychrome mosaics in the Hellenistic period; it might even be considered the height of the craft.  But there are some stylistic differences that set the later mosaics apart.  That includes things like the heavy borders, the interlocking geometric patterns, the use of large(-ish) tesserae, the heavily rounded and shaded facial features, etc.
You can compare them, for example, to [these other 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics](http://followinghadrian.com/2014/10/15/roman-mosaics-from-the-national-archaeological-museum-of-spain-madrid/) from Spain.

Interestingly, it's thought that the interlocking geometric 'panel' designs in some mosaics might have been designed to imitate the elaborate panelling of the ceilings in the rooms where they were laid.

Gorgeous mosaics!  So nice to see that they've been spared the flooding that's overtaken so much of the site.

[Edit]  P.S. Also note some of the qualities I listed for 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics are common to Hellenistic mosaics, too (compare the Zeugma pavements to the [Alexander Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#mediaviewer/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) from Pompeii, for example (ca. 100 B.C.).  An art historian can probably add to this better than I can, but some of the differences are kind of ineffable to pin down.Oh man, crosspost over to /r/AncientCivilizations, they'd love this!They used sealer.awesomeIn Gaziantep, the closest major city to the archeological site, there's a state of the art ""mosaic museum"" that showcases finds from Zeugma. 

I was there a few months ago and had a blast. Southeastern Turkey is completely safe and refreshingly light on on other tourists, making you the recipient of a lot of warm hospitality from the locals.

It's just begging to be done.10 years later: ""Dad, why do I have a 4 point scar in my back?""Does bringing a child into the world automatically bestow a person with perfect balance? Seriously. I see moms/dads balancing a baby in one hand at my job, and groceries + a toddler in the other, like no big deal. I can't even carry a full cup of coffee. WHAT IS THE DEAL, PARENTS.Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. 

One daddy to another: please consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradle them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could get any sleep. 

If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. 

Also: take naps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing. Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. 

After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause both of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your wife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. 

Make sure you have infant Tylenol, baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infants, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all times* when you leave the house with the baby. 

You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. 

Keep a cloth diaper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed for work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the diaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean driveway. 

And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or professional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all just stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.

EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommending baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash cream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner ""<name of baby> has a rash on his/her ash"", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of being a daddy and you might as well get used to it now. id be scared shitless of dropping the baby, trying to catch it, forgetting i was holding a fork, and then stabbing the baby mid drop.A little bit of Velcro and you're ready for an infomercial.[deleted]My daughter used to be like this. Sleeping like a lazy leopard puts pressure on her tummy and lets the wind out. Try burping her for a bit longer after a feed, or massage her tummy, 20 circular rubs (clockwise to help digestion).

Also, I once saw a woman breastfeed both of her twins at once, whilst chowing down on a big ham sandwich. I was very impressed!I usually carry them the opposite way (because head is heavier than butt and it simply feels safer). http://imgur.com/f3Lt5I'm a Mom/Baby nurse.  The first week is definitely the worst.  Baby is programmed to eat every hour or two, mom's milk supply isn't entirely in yet, and you are so sleep-deprived you'd smack your mama in the face to get a 2-hour nap.  It will get better.  I admire your ingenuity.And people say men can't multitask!Try eating with a 32lb 1.5 year old on your left arm, and a 36 lb 3.5 year old on your right arm.  You have to depend on them to feed you properly, in this case.  So once they stop fighting each other, maybe they'll feed daddy.  

BTW, how do you fathers of multiple children deal with , say one is 1.5 years old, barely understanding things, but quite feisty.  Doesn't understand that the 3.5 year old has his toys that she cant touch.  But she doesn't understand this yet.  She only knows to give it back to him when he starts crying for it.  But he gets impatient and starts sacking her, at that point she will refuse to give it back and fight back.... how do I end this????  should i?  should I make him share? 

I've been telling my older son to give her one of her own toys whenever she wants to take one of his.  Or to trade for something he's not using doesn't want..  But he's still very possessive of his own toys.  Glad you weren't hungry for hot soup.My son is the same, only fall a sleep when i carry him on my arm.
Pro tip: Turn the baby around. Keep her shoulder as high up on your arm as you can (by the elbow, where her bum is now in the picture, or even higher up). 
This will be easier for you as all her weight is really in her head, and when she gets heavier you will feel the difference. 
Also it's safer (in my opinion). You can hold her thigh real easy with your hand. Instead of her head, so if she moves you won't have to stress her neck. 
Check this image: http://i.imgur.com/U3tm5.png
See how he holds the thigh? thats the secret to it beeing really comfortable, since you can have your other hand kinda free.
It's recommended that you put your other hand ontop of the child any way, but when you feel you got the hang of it. Youll notice how good it feels.Have you thought of swaddling? works like a charm for little babies. I had preemie twins and it was a life saver.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSYPqGtFBYQDon't let her get used to that bro, she'll end up one of those girls you can eat sushi off of...Man, I haven't laughed at a photo like that in the longest time. She looks like an awesome little chipmunk and I'm sure she'll appreciate you rocking that pic at her 21st birthday party. Congrats man.

A real man is not defined by macho bull shit.  A real man is a man who puts the needs of his children and family before his own.  The sacrificial man. I didn't figure this out until I had children of my own.

It is the innocence of children that forges a mans true strength. But I didn't need to say it. It is clear from the photo that you already understand.

What do all the buttons and levers do? Couple years ago when my son was a toddler he was obsessed with garbage trucks, absolutely in love with them.  Every Friday morning we would sit on the balcony of our 3rd story apartment and watch the big ole WM truck come empty out the dumpsters and my son was just captivated, no matter how many times he had seen them before.

Now my parents lived in a little town about 35 minutes away, and we would visit them at least once a week.  My folks are oddly generous and every week when the garbage men come through their neighborhood my mom will go out there and give them all cold bottles of water, gatorade or soda.  Its just a little thing that has endeared my parents to the garbage men.  

Well just so happens that my sons 3rd bday fell on whatever day of the week was garbage day in my folks neighborhood.  While we were at their house the garbage truck comes rumbling along.  I ran out there as my mom was getting them their drinks and explained that my son just loved the shit out of garbage trucks and offered them $20 to let us have a little ride around the neighborhood.  

The driver refused the money but took us around the neighborhood anyway.  I gave the money to his partner and told him to go have a few rounds on me after work.   For the next year everytime they saw my son and I they would give us a ride, all in all we had 3 ride alongs.   

There's not really a point to this story, other than OPs pic brought back one of my favorite memories of all time.  My son was so god damn excited, but also felt pretty special, which of course made my week.I see ""JAG OFF"" stickers...Pittsburgh? Do you like your job? I've been thinking about being a garbage man. What cool stuff have you found?i'm not sure if you're aware of this...but both of my children LIVED for garbage day when they were small.  they would loose it when they heard the truck and we would run out (no matter what state we were in) to stand on the porch and watch.  we would always say hello and chat briefly with the guys.  (never a lady on my route).  so i'm not sure if you know, but you are ACTUAL heros to many kids out there.  they love you.  what's in the bag?This guy has GOT TO BE from Pittsburgh.

That and ""the shocker""...So instead of giving my trash men beer for the holidays, I should just give them cool stickers for the inside of the truck? I can do that.""Stay Drunk."" Probably not the best sticker to have in your truck. How comfortable is it sitting in there?
lots of people like to think their jobs are important but aren't.  If I didn't go to work for a week who would care?  realistically....no one.  If a garbage man didn't go to work for a week....FUCKING CHAOS.[removed]what country? i used to work as a garbagetruckman in sweden and ours were a whole lot more modern than that, also ended up making them personalized, not so much with stickers but with other things.

remember hooking up a stereo-speaker system to the rear and connecting it to the musicplayer so we didnt miss the song/the radio speaker when getting off to work.

you make surprisingly much as a garbageman in sweden too. i made roughly twice the national average a month from the garbageman job and i finished so early i could have a second part-time job after. worked between 6-10 (rouhly, we got off work when finished with our route, also sometimes had slightly earlier hours) and then had a second work starting at 1pm.

ironically you end up making almost three times swedens national average as a garbageman that way, which is fun because everyone treats you as if you're below them somehow, if only they knew.

also, note to americans, we make very little money in sweden (made up for by a lot of things being ""free"" etc) so the national average monthly salary is ""just"" 2500 a month, however this is enough to have a lower middleclass lifestyle, so it is comparable with ""a lot"" more by US standard of salary.

however, if you have a high paying job in sweden (4000 usd +) you would be better off as an american, as the swedish system is less rewarding when you succeed but gives you more room to succeed.

anyway, just my story.

tl;dr

garbagemen can make 6000+ usd monthly, where as swedens national average is 2500 usd monthly.You from Pittsburgh?

Was it posted?  We occasionally get deaths from people entering the glacial ice caves here in Washington.[deleted]Kinda depressing story ...

When I was 16 I went on an Alaskan cruise.  I got food poisoning and was in bed or throwing up through most of the trip, but I was well enough to watch the cruise through and past a whole bunch of glaciers next to each other.  One after the other.  It was amazing.  It felt like they were SO close to me and the ship.  Totally amazing seeing them all dead end into a big body of water.

So this year I went on the same kind of cruise again.  I'm 31 now and decided it was time to go and not get deathly ill.  It was a great cruise this time, but when it came to cruise past those VERY SAME glaciers ... they were almost gone.  They had receded SO FAR back up the mountains that we were hardly able to get close to them at all.  I had to use my binoculars just to see the detail I was able to see just looking out a window last cruise.  

The amount of melting, just in the short 15 years I had been there last, was SO fucking depressing to me.

tl;dr:  Went to Alaska 15 years apart.  Glaciers are disappearing.  We're fucked as a species.In the years to come when this is reposted kids will ask ""what's a glacier?""This image reminds me of a documentary of Inuit mussel-gatherers waiting for the sea ice to drop so they can break through the ice and harvest mussels before the sea rises again. Here's the documentary by BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMZYDQ6v24How thick is the ice above you? Seems like sunlight can get throughI now realize if Superman had his ice fortress it would have melted by now.

GG global warming GGThat looks incredible OPI saw the picture and said ""whoa"" out loud.  This is /r/whoahdude  worthy.I wonder how the water tastes.Light blue helmet looks very happy :)Is that Mendenhall Glacier?That is so fucking cool and so fucking scary at the same time.That's a bit clumsy of you. They're huge!How dangerous is that? I went camping at some ice caves a few years back (not inside, just near them) and there were signs everywhere saying to not go in them and if you do to not make any noise in them. In fact, a few months back a person was killed and some injured due to back to back collapses in a matter of days.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlDxgo-L7DMLook out for Falmer.I remember a geology professor explicitly telling us how incredibly dangerous hiking ""into"" a glacier isHow dangerous is that? I mean, if they're receding so quickly, they'd be weak and thin, no? But thin for a glacier is much more than enough to fall and kill someone.  I didn't even know you could do that.

In America our elders just spend our money.  Then blame us for it.This is the way men were expected to act when they were growing up, and how people in general still should. You hear stories form the Titanic where the men would put on their best suits and usher their wives and children into the lifeboats and tell them they'd get on the next one and not to worry. They knew they were about to die, but they did it with dignity. Again here you have the old stepping up and taking fate with dignity to make sure others don't suffer.

I hope to god if a moment in life is put forward like this to me I'm not too cowardly to let someone else take the risk for me.This is called heroism. I read an article about this a while back.

Pervert frog is watching you.[deleted]I never would have guessed that a cute picture of a frog could hide such a shitstorm of OP-hating and drama. I wish I had an awesome shower frog :/He keeps the bugs down. I like it.Oh man, frogs are kickass. I remember when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old, me and a friend made some traps out of plastic bottles. We caught around 20 frogs and one trout in a single day. Ended up digging an old aquarium out of the basement and putting them in that. Made a lot of land space with aquarium sand, had a little watery bit and put the trout in there. Only problem was that my room didn't have enough space, so I had to put it in my 3 year old sisters room. Turns out frogs can jump *(Who knew)*, and will do so if put in a shitty aquarium. I awoke to the sound of my little sister laughing like a maniac and my mother flipping shit. Ran in to see the room, including my little sisters crib fucking covered in frogs. God damn that was hilarious. Then my mother found the trout. More shit was flipped, and I had to set the frogs, and the god damn motherfucking trout free in our garden. **I released a motherfucking trout into the natural fucking habitat of my god damn front lawn!** He had it coming though, that trout was a dick. Smug bastard. Watching 20 something frogs, and one trout jump around on the lawn was good fun. Me and that friend ended up having a lot of fun with frogs and trouts that summer.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, take good care of that frog, he might very well save your life one day. Oh, and trouts are dicks.He has licked your toothbrushI have never seen a group of people so concerned on the states of someone's else's shower in which they will never be. I think it's really cool that you have a little amphibian buddy in there, but the people who are bothered by him being near your toothbrush are right - frogs can carry salmonella and other germs that you don't want to get in your mouth.I like frogs a lot, he's pretty cute.  I can't help thinking he'd be happier outside.He doesn't bother you, but I bet he bothers all over your toothbrush.Frogs, like other reptiles and amphibians, can have salmonella on their skin.  Right next to your toothbrush *might* not be be the safest place to let him chill.I've got quite a few of this same species of frog living on my property (like OP, I'm also in Florida) and about two years ago we had a record breaking cold winter night. It pretty much devastated all of my tropical plants and killed dozens of these little guys. They were strewn about my property like little frozen frogsicles.

Anyway, that same morning I woke up to a frog swimming around my toilet. I had no idea how it got in there, but I calmly escorted him out of the house. On my way back in my wife shrieked, ""there's a frog in the toilet!"" To which I replied that I already got him out. But clearly I didn't because, sure enough, there was a frog in the toilet. And then another and another and another...

All told, there were around 20 frogs in the toilet itself and the pipes leading to it. According to the plumber who was hired to get them out, they crawled in there for warmth (and probably did so through the vent). It was one of the most bizarre things I'd ever experienced but the plumber disagreed, ""Nothing peculiar about it. Just got some frogs in your toilet.""

Gotta love Florida.you're gonna be pissed as fuck when he turns out to be a she and shits frog spawn all over your shower. Pissed As Fuck.

Got some great night shots on the tripod but no sun rise.Hey, really nice shot! [I got a similar result on Mt. Meru in Tanzania](http://i.imgur.com/QOMhvx4.jpg).

Here's an excellent explanation from NASA:

http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/30may_solareclipse2/

> ""Solar images formed by pinholes, crossed fingers, patches between leaves, all occur because of diffraction--a wave property of light. In the case of a pinhole, the light rays do not shoot straight by the rim of the hole, but bend around the edge. This wave effect creates a diffraction pattern of rings on the screen which resembles a bull's eye. That's for a flat wave single light source. If the aperture is illuminated by a scene, it acts as a lens to image the scene on a screen. With the right size hole relative to the right distance to a screen, a clear image is formed. That's the general principle of a pinhole camera.""
> 
> ""Applying this to an eclipse observation, the sun becomes the object to view. Point the pinhole camera at the sun and you see a solar image (projected on a screen) dim enough your eyes can enjoy.""
> 
> ""But the pinhole effect doesn't need a designed aperture. The solar image can be formed by any aperture if the shadow is the right distance away. The sunrays though tree leaves work to make a solar image on the ground below. Blinds on the window will covert a square opening into a round sun on the wall.""
> 
> ""The marvel is that diffraction doesn't need a round hole to form an image. A square pinhole will also work if its area is the same. Even for a random edged shape, the wave bending will average out to form an image of the scene contained in the incident light. That's why the spots of light through the trees are round; the gaps in the foliage are imaging the sun. ""I... Don't understand how the sun being partially blocked would change the shadows that a tree casts.Who's the dipshit building attack-speed Soraka?That's an amazing shot!

Think about all of the cameras pointed up at the moon when this was taken, and this smart guy is facing the opposite way.The last time a total eclipse happened in my area, I was 7 or 8. We were in school and we all went out with our two pieces of paper to see the pinhole effect. I was a hyper kid and my teacher hated me so as soon I started to get the least bit out of hand she sent me to sit on the curb in the shade and miss the eclipse. I was super bummed seeing as how I really liked science stuff. As I sat there I started to notice all the shadows changing around me. It was like millions of little pinhole eclipses all around me. All of the rest of the class was out in the parking lot with their shitty paper pinholes but I had my own personal light show. It was cool as shit. Thanks for bringing back that memory OP. It happensh here in Shcotland, too. My ash looksh like a shilver-birch! 
http://imgur.com/ZSbxkuLI know what's happening here! My physics teacher showed us an extremely similar photo. It's called a pinhole camera. The leaves in the tree have tiny little holes in them that the sunshine is passing through. This causes the image to be projected upside down on to the house like that.

Fun fact! If you wear glasses get a piece of paper and poke a tiny hole in it. Look through it without your glasses with one eye and you should be able to see clearly through the hole.Pretty sure if you had a staff with a gem on it you could stick it in the ground and use mirrors to uncover ancient secretsi saw this once in...1993 I think?  I was walking to class and saw half moons all over the sidewalk.  I knew right away what it was.

Luckily I was going to the engineering building and they has all kinds of stuff to look at it.  the best was looking through a compact disc.toenail clippings...everywhere.Looks like Porom and Palom just cast FlareAlso, during near-totality, overhead power and communication lines will throw sharp shadows. Normally they don't throw a shadow at all because they are much thinner than the sun's disk.Photographer and light enthusiast here. What you're looking at here is the camera obscura effect.

I am really excited that the US is actually going to be in the path of a total solar eclipse in August of 2017.

I wish I could see the signature, as I likely know the doctor in question!

My own GP hates requests for sick notes. I once called in sick a single time in a six month period, and was asked for a note. Spitefully, my GP wrote me off for three weeks in a glorious August, filling in the ""reason for absence"" section as ""None of your goddamn business. Confidentiality trumps bullshit policy."" That was the last time I was asked for a sick note.
 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! If you ever need health care in Halifax I'll be sure you get a real saline drip, not the bagged harbour water were usually use!Yep I just show up sick, do a really half-assed job, spread the illness around then go home. The American way.This is the perfect way to deal with that kind of policy.

Calm and understanding tone to maintain rapport. Expose the extra work and problems it causes. Mirror the absurdity by requiring an equally useless piece of work from them. Invoice them for the unnecessary cost. Appeal to the sense of community they (probably unknowingly) betray by outsourcing the cost of their organizational distrust for employees to other businesses.

Great lesson in diplomacy, right here.I do find it kind of silly that companies require a Doctors note if you are sick.

My company does this and I always cringe when I have to tell the employee that policy requires a doctors note if they call in sick more than a day or two.
If someone has the flu, stay the hell home. I don't care, we'll figure shit out.
Sure if you tell me you have a physical injury, I need a note and instructions from your doctor on what you can do when you get back for those who have positions that require physical labour, but if you just had the flu? Stay the hell home, I don't really care.
In the end most of them are paid hourly, if it isn't busy season...you are saving me money.
It's more of a deterrent for people who BS sick days, but it doesn't really work there either. Since they'll find a doctor to fill that stuff out regardless, so you're just wasting everyones time.

My dad used to work in an ER in Nova Scotia. He said it was completely fucked. So many people with very minor issues clogging everything up.Years ago I was a server and the flu hit me while I was working Handling food, drinks, silverware... GM sent me home seeing for himself I was really sick and said don't come in tomorrow. I was supposed to work the following 3 days. I did not show up the next day but by the third I was feeling better and came in. 

The MOD asked for my doctors note. I did not go to the doc nor could I afford the $150 to go to the walk-in clinic. She fired me on the spot leaving the floor short a server. 

The GM called 4 days later asking me WTF? I explained everything to him and he fired the MOD. 

EDIT: GM did not call me 4 days later but 4 days after the initial ""go home you're sick"". 1 day after the firing.Good on that doctor. Fantastic. I remember waiting with my wife in a walk-in clinic for four hours so she could be seen for 2 minutes so she could buy a note from the doctor's office for a flu. Biggest waste of time ever, but her company required itI got written up at an old job for refusing to give them a note. It was worth it to me- I'm not going to the doctor for a migraine, there's nothing they can do, it's just going to cost me more money on top of the money I'm losing by being unable to work.Whats even stranger is friends and family telling me to see a doctor. Its a fucking cold!That's the most Canadian ""fuck you"" I've ever seen. Bravo. Sick notes are for teenagers in high school, not middle aged employees. And they're nonsense anyway. I know what a 24hr stomach virus looks like. I know I don't need a doctor for it. Why the heck should I drag myself to a doctor's office unnecessarily just to appease my company's paranoia.I work in a hospital, and the policy here is essentially ""come in sick or it counts against you"".  Obviously, they don't say that, and they don't want us to work while sick, but they still ding you for calling out (even with a doctor's note).

So, we work around sick patients, which means we're likely to get sick, and we're less likely to call out, so we're likely to make our co-workers sick.  The whole thing is stupid.Instead of asking medical note because of abuse of sick leave benefit, why don't companies hire people they trust? 

If you trust your employees so little that you need to treat them like liars when they call in sick then you need to reconsider your hiring practices.Good for that doctor. I despise the sick note policies that so many companies have.  

I was once so sick with the flu that I genuinely couldn't get out of bed to go see my doctor to get a note, so I went back a couple of days later when I was feeling better to ask her for the note my manager required. I obviously wasn't sick anymore, so she just asked me what dates I was sick and wrote the note accordingly.  

So clearly it doesn't matter if I'm actually sick or not, as long as my doctor will vouch for me. But I have to be a drain on the healthcare system either way. I worked for a retail art supply store, and they brought in a new manager who decided to implement a similar policy of requiring a note if you called in sick.  I told him it cost money and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket for something like that, especially because I had already lost a days wages (no sick days), and was only making $8.50/hour.  He said that I wouldn't be re-imbursed, so I said ""no"".  Nothing more was said. I like the doctors note though, anything which put the responsiblity for such a paternalistic, and wasteful policy back on the employer. 

Its ironic isn't it, an employer generally wants a note to make sure the employee isn't being irresponsible and playing hooky; but the reality is that the request itself is far more irresponsible in its actual effect when you consider the extra strain it puts on the health care system.  

TL; DR= The dr. nailed it.I'm sorry, but screw demanding doctors' notes unless it's an extended illness.

""Oh, you're feeling sick today? NOW YOU MUST GO OUT OF YOUR HOME INSTEAD OF RESTING UP AND PAY A $50 COPAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING SICK.""

How about, if you don't trust your employees enough to believe them when they call in, you're a moron for employing them?I was home due to chicken pox this week and last week.

I work in IT, specifically as a senior DBA. I told them I would be out for 2 weeks but would be fully capable of working from home.

The following happened:

 - Boss required me to bring in a doctor's note with the diagnosis and expected return date.
 - Did not give me permission to work from home (yet made the expectation of such clear)
 - Made it quite clear that, in no uncertain terms, if I didn't have a note, I'd be dismissed for work abandonment.

I informed said boss that so long as I was chewing up sick time, I would not, for any reason what-so-ever, log into the VPN. At no point would I answer any pages nor emergency alerts. I informed him he was welcome to talk to HR / Legal about my stance and who was in the right.

This is the week that the cluster decided to have problems.

I can't wait to tell him that in another week I'm going to be out again for a gall bladder removal.

Like a dimestore hooker without any customers.If my job search is any indication this letter will never get read by any human person and the Dr. will get an automated reply saying ""thank you for applying but the position has already been filled.""Yeah that's bullshit. You're not a fucking child. Funniest part about sick notes is 99% of the time I'm sick because of the poor sanitation policies around your nasty work place.Problem is call centres dont give a fuck. Its an awful place to work the company knows it is so they do this to prevent people from taking stress days and such because not having every possible person on the phones hurts their business. Every call centre says that they are better than the rest but all of them eventually treat you like numbers and not like human beings.The best part here in the states is requiring a note when your company doesnt offer health insurance. Its such a big ""fuck you"" to your employees.

Basically a strongly emitting source of radiation is kept in a chamber with tubes leading through the chamber. Vials of samples get pushed into the chamber with an air shuttle kind of arrangement so they can get irradiated for analysis.

While the core of the reactor is housed in a heavy lead vessel, the rest of the reactor is made of cement with iron slugs used as aggregate instead of gravel. The iron chunks don't stop gamma emission as well as lead, but they do a better job than gravel.

One day, several trucks of cement were scheduled to begin casting of the walls of the core. The prof strenuously advised the construction foreman to only fill the trucks 1/3 full because the iron slugs would be considerably more dense than the aggregate they usually use. The foreman ignored the warnings, chalking them up as being the prattlings of an old naggy man and didn't give any orders to short fill the trucks. 

The trucks departed the cement plant charged with cement and iron aggregate and suffered eventual failure of all of their tires on the highway. They got stuck there loaded up with their massive overburdens of iron aggregate cement until their drum motors and bearings failed and the cement set inside the drums. They had to cut the drums apart off of the trucks  with plasma torches and jackhammers to clear up the heavy mess.Got any more details on location?

edit: Ok I got it. Look at the orange thing in the center of the white ""loop"", thats the Mallards mouth + nostrils facing TOWARDS you. then the little spaces in the bottom are its feet

The swan is facing left, the mallard is facing towards the camera basically.I'm going to disagree with the majority here. It's a wonderful concept but the execution is a little unrefined. The type face of the logo and the restaurant are not the same so it feels disconnected. I think if the designer had instead focused on drawing the animals to create the ampersand, rather than squeezing them in to the sans serif ampersand, it would have better reflected the elegance of the type face in *The Swan & Mallard*.

Walk of shameThis reminds me of my old 'triever, Ben. Like most of 'em he loved water, even when he was reeeally old.

We went to house sit for some friends in Dorset (UK) when he was about 12 and cracking on a bit (actually lasted till 16 bless him). One day I took him and my much younger german shepherd Sadie for a walk, and we came across this sort of drainage ditch/ stream that was about as deep as I am tall and about the same distance across, so pretty deep and steep. Ben smells the water and, with a speed I didn't realise he was still capable of, decides to clamber down to it. He sank up to his belly in mud. I went in after him and tried to haul him out but the sides were too high - the best I could do was hold him in my arms against the side of the ditch so he didn't sink any deeper. We were good and stuck.

The antics of my frantic younger dog and my panicked shouts eventually attracted the attention of another dog walker, and I begged her to go back to where we were staying, about half a mile away, and get my mum. She headed off after tying Sadie to the bridge over the ditch for me.

I waited for what seemed like hours, probably about half an hour, up to my calves in pretty cold mud, covered in more mud and a copious amount of hair, holding an exhausted dog. I was wearing a sundress, so my arms and legs were covered in scratches as well. 

Suddenly, firemen! My mum had called them after hearing the description of the ditch. I have never been so happy to see firemen. In minutes they had placed Ben into a large tarp and hauled him out of there and pulled me out. Mum and Ben got a lift back in the fire engine but they couldn't fit me and Sadie, and I was pretty much a mud person by then. I didn't want to ruin my shoes so I ended up walking back barefoot with a frantic germen shepherd stepping all over my feet on a gravel road with no pavement.

By the time I got back my mum had made the firemen (must have been about 8 of them at least) cups of tea. She then got the hose out to start hosing Ben down and the bastard started running around the garden to get away from the water with all the energy of a dog half his age.

The firemen did offer to pressure hose me but I declined.

**TLDR - elderly dog tried to swim in a 6ft deep, steep sided ditch full of mud, I got stuck trying to get him out, got covered in mud, hot firemen rescued me looking like a cavewoman, dog regained enough energy to run away from the hosepipe afterwards.**How hard did you laugh?[deleted]I thought this was a honey badger from the thumbnailThat's the difference from a Lab and a Golden.

https://secure.npca.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1391Well, fuck. What's Cali complaining about? I can see shit loads of water.[This is from a trip I made a few months ago, here's a link to more if anyone's interested.](http://imgur.com/a/08QJN)In Oregon, the entire coastline is public. You cannot buy it. California has many robust laws governing development, particularly in coastal areas.  Laws like the California Coastal Act prohibit restricting public access to beaches and make all development on the coast subject to government review.  The California Environmental Quality Act gives *anyone* legal standing in court to litigate against a permitting agency (City, County, etc.) if the agency has not fully disclosed, evaluated, and mitigated for environmental impacts resulting from a development.  CEQA especially is used by environmental activist groups to prevent development in pristine habitats.  It's not a 100% effective method to prevent development, however.  Usually the goal is to delay the project so long that the developer runs out of money or the investment loses its profitability and they give up.

A great example of a beautiful place in California that was slated for luxury development is the [Gaviota Coast](http://www.sblandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Gaviota-Morning-Tajiguas.jpg) near Santa Barbara.  The development proposed on that land was litigated for decades before the developer went bankrupt.that's definitely big sur.I'm a land use planner who, with my colleagues, manages the Local Coastal Program for a northern California county. The majority of my day is spent getting yelled at by landowners who don't understand why they can't develop their land however they would like. Thanks for appreciating the reason I get yelled at all the time! Speaking of protected coast, I just took a canoe ride down the Russian River here in CA. There were tons of spots on the shore that said ""Private shore, no stopping here."" Is there no protection for river access? That seems crazy to me.For those of us who want to preserve wild space in the Bay Area, check out [Peninsula Open Space Trust](http://www.openspacetrust.org). They use donations to buy up land and create parks and other protected open space. 

They help keep my weekends looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gm9pKRp.jpg). 

The people who protect California's coast from development already live on the coast.This image brought to you by the fine folks at Hearst Corp. Heres a picture of me enjoying some Pad Thai in the same exact spot that this picture was taken

""http://rebelsdocumentary.org/the-film/synopsis/Yep, its a pretty impressive place is Big Sur. The US National Park system is honestly one of the wonders of the modern world.

That's the most I've ever felt a commercial flight banked to one side.  My face was smashed against the window and people were holding on to the armrests to not smash the people next to them.

I'm not really trying to shit talk him, as Hal Taylor is easily one of the best chair makers in the country of this fashion (Maloof reproductions).  But if you build near reproductions for a living I think things can get a little funny.

A few different sized *Mammuthus* species lived in Siberia at different times, the Southern Mammoth and the Steppe Mammoth were both older and about twice the size of the Woolly Mammoth which was actually pretty small.

This was taken in Etosha National Park, Namibia [edit: detailed location removed, see comments below]. I waited at a waterhole for 7 hours from noon to 7pm. There was very little wildlife activity during the afteroon, and only a few springboks showed up to drink. At around 6pm the sky was still overcast and I almost decided to leave, but eventually decided to stay until the end of the day. The real show started around 6:30pm as the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.

I went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.

I travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience. Go if you ever get the chance!

Finally I have a [photography website](http://www.johangeorget.com) for those who wish to see pictures of this trip. I hope no one will mind me that I share the links here.

I love it!I wonder how the timelapse will end up now that this is posted on Reddit..I passed this sign on a hike of the top of at Mt Diablo last Friday. For anyone in the Bay Area it's a great time to go. The wildflowers are everywhere and there are some that have not been seen in 50+ years because the fire has allowed for the right conditions for them to show up again. Also the clear days we've been getting make for killer views where you can see the GG bridge and Lake Tahoe Mountains.I interviewed one of the people behind this idea. The phone holder is worth $1.50 and can be found at most hardware stores.

Pretty ingenious idea and a great way to keep across ecosystem regrowth after fires. Check out the interview [here](https://soundcloud.com/1233newcastle/monitoring-fire-regrowth-with-smartphones) if you want. I saw this today too, all over Twitter.

That's me in the pic! Check out www.operationthonapa.com for the whole story. Great fun and a crazy trip....never actually thought we would find what we were after Can you imagine spending so much time and energy on this, and then seeing it on the ground and picking it up. Probably a very surreal moment I've been following their [blogging](https://operationthonapa.com/) as they have found different items from the plane, human remains, etc. This is an amazing story to watch unfold and my hat's off to these awesome two dudes. Talk about having a goal and getting it done.

More info on the crash: 
[Eastern Airlines Flight 980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980)Dan Futrell and I (Isaac Stoner) got lost down a rabbit hole on on Wikipedia looking up unrecovered black boxes. Took some serious effort but now there's a smashed up flight recorder on my kitchen counter!  That's the orange box. They need to keep looking.Actually, they found pieces of the casing of the flight recorders, and some loose magnetic tape which, [as they themselves say on their blog](https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61), may be nothing more than tape from a passenger's home video.

It's far too early to say they've found anything substantive, regardless of how amazing it is that they've managed to find anything at all.I just got to the part of the blog where they talk about finding crocodile skins all over the debris field, and basically accusing Eastern Airlines of taking part in a crocodile skin smuggling ring. Interesting...maybe they'll end up uncovering more than they bargained for, which is like the beginning of every horror/thriller movie.Why didn't any of the various airplane crash investigative agencies do this?

edit: answered my own question, sort of:  The NTSB did send people but ""because the wreckage was spread over a vast area and covered by 6 to 9 meters of snow, it was not possible for him and his fellow team members to locate either of the ""black boxes.""""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980#On-site_investigationI set small goals like not losing a sock in the laundry and I can't even accomplish that.I had read their blog as they were doing this. The part where they were finding the human remains and burying them... super powerful stuff man. I teared up a little reading that. Congrats on finding the recorder!That's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Or a small box in the Andes...Holy shit this is awesome. It makes me want to find another plane crash that has missing black boxes and go find one myself... Talk about bucket list shit.I bet it was the last place they looked.This will be an over dramatized movie, I guarantee it. ""dood we fahkin found the blahk bawx bro""Notice the subtle middle finger in the picture.I feel like they could have found this faster by crashing another plane into the mountain and watching where everything fell.Send these dudes after 370. Was anyone else thinking of the flight that crashed into the Andes mountains in 1972 and everyone had to resort to cannibalism?

>It started while Kaszlikowski was shooting the upcoming documentary K2 Touching the Sky. He wanted a personal project to occupy his downtime during the weeks-long filming schedule, so he sent his DJI Phantom on a recon mission to scout shooting locations. The drone scoped out places around Concordia, the area below K2 where the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers converge. Kaszlikowski spotted a section of glacier that was melting away, creating a dramatic clone-like structure and a picturesque miniature river.

>“The place was special, making a very clean graphic frame,” he says. “It was disappearing, melting, changing its form every day. It was quite obvious nobody will photograph it again like me; nobody will see it the same way the next season.”

Here's a summary on the shot and the [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/david-kaszlikowski-k2-glacier/)Higher resolution mirror wallpaper [Link](https://i2.wp.com/www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/033.jpg) (2200 x 1352)Looks like where you'd find an Ice-Type Legendary.This clears up some issues of what why it looks like that: 

*The Polish photographer and a guide trekked to the spot at night to create a strange but vivid image that looks like it might be an alien planet. He used a 30-second exposure shot with a Canon 5D Mark III on a tripod. While the shutter was open, he “painted” the water and surrounding area with an LED, creating an eerie glow on the ice and sky. Although he was there during the summer, the temperature still drops to a frosty 5 degrees Fahrenheit up there at 16,000 feet, so his hands were plenty cold while working.*

*The final image plays tricks with size and scale, and the foreground doesn’t provide many clues. Although the bend in the river is 65 feet wide, the mountains in the background are some of the highest in the world. The region includes K2, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum I and II—all of them topping 26,000 feet.*Needs a Yeti.I'm going to need a gold Chocobo.Looks like the pool with the moon spirits in the northern water tribe in avatarThe boundaries between reality and sci-fi are now blurred more than everI'd love to check out what kind of rocks are in there. i thought it was a 3d model at firstAnd then [these motherfuckers](https://i.imgur.com/kogRcW0.jpg) trod everywhere through it.This was not* a ""drone"", it was an rc helicopter (or [radio controlled multirotor helicopter](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom) ).  I know it's another mags/clips thing, but if we all try, I think we can correct it!  
*Edit: As pointed out below, this model has a self-guided self-operation mode, so I guess it qualifies as a drone and an rc helicopter. _The more you know!_Bullshit. That's a bowl of rocky mint chocolate chip HagenDaas in front of a picture of stars and mountains. What is making drones so ubiquitous now that wasn't present 10 years ago?

Did we not know how to make quad rotored remote control helicopters back then?  Is it the small cameras?

So I go back to searching and don't find any thing else. So we get back to school and I ask for it back and she says ""no I'm keeping for the class to see, it's going on display"".

The popular opening parade runs for 12 kilometers and will consist of 50 tall sailing ships. Many of the vessels will have sailed there directly from Bremerhaven in Germany where another tall ships event ended last Sunday.

>In total, more than 1,000 vessels are expected to participate in the sailing extravaganza in IJ bay. Organizers expect up to two million visitors to attend the free event.

**Photo Details:**

This photo is a 26.6 MP photo  merged from two 24 MP shots from a Sony a7 camera. I had a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.4 manual focus lens (with a B+W filter for protection) attached. The two shots were merged using Lightroom's built in photomerge (which results in a single raw pano). Not much was done in Lightroom other than exposure changes, color changes and some healing brush to remove lens flare.

This photo was taken after I shot a 3 hour timelapse of the sunrise. I was just about leave, when I decided to actually take a few photos.

Now the other fucking post i was reading with the 2 army tanks makes a HELL of a lot more sense now.
I've been thinking about it for the past 20 minutes and couldn't understand why i was so fucking confused =sIf the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay was what it historically was, it would filter the entire bay's volume of water in 3 days. The oyster population is so low now that it takes over a year. Can the oysters also predict the World Series winner?Oysters are great. I organize an effort in my town to create oyster mats. These mats are chained together in specific areas of the river and foster new oyster beds by giving the larvae a place to attach to. If we get enough growth, it may have a positive effect on our river's water quality. Each oyster can filter 50 gallons a day of water and they are a keystone species of many ecosystems.This isn't as clear-cut of a comparison as the image wants you to believe. The water being clear isn't an indication of ecological health any more than being murky is. Murky could be pollutants, but it could also be algae. Algae are necessary to the ecosystem. The water on the right appears stripped of algae because the oysters eat it. That's good up to a point, and then it starts being a problem.

If I showed you this exact same image using lake water and zebar mussels, it would be a demonstration of the ecological damage done by invasive zebra mussels.That's where the flavour comes from.Question: Can I get oysters and put them in a fish tank with my fish and never have to clean the water again? Or at least not clean it so often?I can't look at this without being horribly reminded about getting norovirus from oysters a couple of years ago, and this pic kinda makes it a bit clearer just how easy it is for them to pick up bacteria from the water. I've never been so ill in my adult life and haven't been able to eat oysters since! From my intense studying and observations, the water with the oysters seems to be cleaner.

Turns out, he's never seen snow or experienced cold weather. He told me he had a jacket and showed me a paper thin Members Only jacket. I explained to him about the dangers of frostbite and the importance of thick socks, boots, gloves, hats,  and having a real coat.

I even drove him to Goodwill where he found the right clothes for a tough Ohio winter. For the next few months, he would smile and thank me for teaching him about how to stay warm with the right clothes. 

Edit: grammarI went to college with this girl who was Swedish, but grew up in Miami. Swedish family, spoke Swedish at home, etc. But in South Florida. She made regular trips to Sweden every summer to visit family there.

But never in the winter. One year she flies to Sweden in December and it's snowing. She reacts to snow the way most people in south Florida do--joy, utter amazement, running around trying to catch flakes on your tongue, etc.

Because of different grade levels there, he was actually a year or two younger than the rest of us. We became friends. One day he asked me about the leaves changing colors and I explained how they would do that and then they would all fall off. He then asked a very anxious follow-up question:

""Will they come back?"" :-)

I reassured him they would. It began to snow on the first day of a freshman undergrad class I was in. A classmate from India with a thick accent shyly admitted he had never seen snow, so our professor encouraged our small class to run outside so Mohit could experience snowfall. I'll never forget his big smile, total sense of wonder, and his first comment when we got outside: ""Oh my goodness! It is like God has really bad dandruff!""

After assuring him it wouldnt affect his drive home, he asked me what happened when it melted.i was confused. 

i said ""what?  what do you mean?""

""when it all melts what happen?  do they have to close the roads cuz they are all flooded?""

That's how i would react if I ever see snow. (I'm from California)My aunt is married to a man who had children with two other women before he met her. His first wife lived near them in New Jersey, but the second was in Arizona. When their son was a teen, he moved from Arizona to NJ to spend some time with his dad and get the benefit of the better school system. They had his mom up for holidays, and while she was visiting for christmas it snowed heavily... and she'd never seen snow before, she'd lived her whole life in Arizona. My aunt bundled her up in some winter wear and took her for a walk.

She knew it fell from the sky. She knew it was cold. She'd had a sno-cone before, so she kinda understood the texture. What she hadn't imagined was how *quiet* the world becomes when it snows, how the snow absorbs all sound and there's a beautiful silence.

I've only built one brick/stone wall, but when we did it we started at the bottom.> Just as individual blocks were prepared, so too were the adjoining stones already set in the wall.  In order to receive a new block, bedding planes were carved into those stones below or to the side of the block to be added. This is how the Twelve-Angled Stone took on its busy upper outline; the upper portions of the block were recarved several times over as five blocks — set in a left to right sequence — were fitted along the course above.

> Other blocks in the wall were similarly shaped, then reshaped as new blocks were added to the masonry mass. As stones of irregular size and degree of finish were inserted into the mural fabric with fastidious technical consistency, the wall went up as tectonic sculpture.

- Adam Herring, “Shimmering Foundation: The Twelve-Angled Stone of Inca Cusco,” Critical Inquiry, Autumn 2010.

**Edit:**  Several comments questioned my use of ""nearly a thousand years."" Here's where I got that figure: according to wikipedia, Cusco was founded in 1100, and then occupied by the Inca ""from the 13th Century to the 16th Century."" I have no idea when that particular stone was laid, but it seems to have been somewhere between 500 and 900 years ago.  I was intentionally vague with the date, since I don't know the exact century. I've also seen suggestions that it predates the Inca. If someone has that info, I'd appreciate you commenting with it!

**Edit 2:**  Just out of curiosity, I went through and counted: as of right now, there are 54 top-level comments jokingly asserting that this was aliens.  There are 17 top-level comments that are literally just the word ""aliens.""  In the time it took me to count, 4 more were added.

These guys were obviously getting paid by the hour.Ancient Aztec masons were agents of the Mexican Nuevo World Order as directed by the Illuminachos. I'm not saying it's aliens...But totally aliens.If there's one thing I've realised, it's that humans a thousand (or more) years ago were just as intelligent as we are today. Sure they didn't have anything like the technology we have, but they were just as skilled and had equally rich and complex lives as those we have today.Meanwhile, [last week...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O38QHzM0tzw/S-YAkoeP58I/AAAAAAAAB20/7FQ5sd8tv7k/s1600/IMG_1133.JPG)[there's no end to what you can do when you don't give a fuck about particular people](http://i.imgur.com/7R6PWWN.jpg)Quick Background before comment:  I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Architecture.  My thesis specifically focused on the integration of 3D printing technologies into masonry construction, using ancient approaches as a basis for design.

Now.  Something to know about these masonry walls is that they are not nearly as intricate and ""perfect"" as they appear to be.  From the outside (the face), the stones are chiseled using the surrounding stone as a basis.  On the interior of the wall, however, you will find that each of these stones is more ""wedge"" shaped, and is held in place with a plethora of smaller ""filler rocks.""  

From the outside, it looks impossible.  Once you look inside, you'll find that it's really just as simple as shaping one side of the rock, just along the edges.Peru was an amazing country to visit, I thoroughly enjoyed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. Some of the most amazing scenery. Anyone who has thought about going to Peru, fucking do it, spend at least a month there there's so much to see!

On a side note, I can't stand the ancient aliens bull shit. I don't think we give nearly enough credit to ancient peoples and their intelligence and ingenuity.

90% of dogs would be okay with a pet in that situation. 10% would not. Don't risk it. Sadly this is probably for insurance purposes. Most companies ask what type of dog you have and if it belongs to one of the groups they feel are an issue they will ask if your yard is fenced and if you have a sign. This keeps your premiums from going up much higher than if you didn't have a sign or fence. Some municipalities also require it as well. I have several GSD's and my insurance agent about died when I exclaimed I didn't intend to fence my entire property. I told him they're all trained and won't hurt anyone unless commanded to.

It was a miniature dachshund, I think her breed were known for being particularly nasty but this dog was the sweetest thing. 

She loved everything and everyone except one thing: The doorbell, her dreaded enemy. 

The doorbell going off was one of the few times we heard her bark. This dog was about 6-7 pounds at most but when she barked she sounded like she was the size of a husky.

It was the funniest thing, watching canvassers ring the bell and get this look of complete horror when the heard the barking. The look on their faces when they saw it was coming from a mini-dachshund was priceless.Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!I had a Siberian Husky that looked like a wolf. He was built like a machine, and looked ferocious, which was nice because I lived in a place kind of sketchy at night.

Twice my house was broken into with my giant direwolf downstairs & both times my dog barked & scared off the intruders.   
Instead of going to attack them, he was just saying ""Look at me"" then prancing towards him like a bubbly giant puppy hoping for head scratches.

People would cross the street to not have to walk near him, and he would bark trying to say ""Hey, I'm friendly please pat me on the head"" but everyone was scared of the love bug. Now I have a Shiba Inu & she's more of a guard dog than my Husky ever was.Seems as if he's trying to look at his own tongue and has gone cross-eyed.

I recognize Starry Night and The Scream, but what are the other paintings?As a salary-paid working artist I can't deny how exciting this is. Peoples first thoughts are obviously 'lol welp artists aren't needed', and to some very small corner of our industry, that may be true. But for me, I'm always looking for a new tool to speed up my workflow and this has incredible potential. A lot of times it's easier to stitch together photographs in interesting ways (called photobashing) instead of making a painting from scratch. I could see great situations where you spend time making one painting that has all the unique styling and flavor (a style frame or 'alpha' image ). Then spending the rest of your time making quick photo stitched illustrations not worrying about the final look, but focusing on the idea. When you've captured whatever ideas in your series of images, how cool would it be to input your 'alpha' image and let the neural network do its thing to the other photo-based illustrations. These are really exciting times!HA HA and the artist thought their jobs were protected from the machines.

If you want to talk about, share results, and develop image style transfer tools you're welcome to stop by:

https://www.reddit.com/r/deepstyle/What happens when you use the Van Gogh style on Starry Night? Do you get (Van Gogh)^2?wow this is my home town! If anyone is wondering this is Tübingen in Germany and it's taken from the Neckarbrücke.

The picture is actually taken from wikipedia:

Yay for our future distopia! Awesome!What does neural mean when it comes to this?This is a taste of the (relatively) new field of ""non-photorealistic imaging"" from computer science.  Computers can make things photo-realistic (see this [Morgan Freeman video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEdRLlqdgA4)), but it's very difficult to make images appear as paintings. 

There have been great advances in this technology.  Does anyone remember the Keanu Reeves ""cartoon"" movie, [A Scanner Darkly] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY5PpGQ2OWY)?  Here is a 2006 [paper] (http://kucg.korea.ac.kr/seminar/2008/src/PA-07-12.pdf) that describes how they do this in real time.  It's not that difficult for a computer; the basic steps are:

- Get the ""Difference of Gaussian"" line edges (find edges in the picture)
- Make a line drawing of the image from the above step
- Fill in the colors by doing a ""Luminance Quantiziation""; the simple explanation is the computer divides the colors up into, say, 100 different shades.  Then, for each pixel, decide which shade to ""round"" to.  This gives a ""cartoony"" feel to the image
- Done!

Again, this is something that can be done in REAL TIME; it doesn't take a lot of processing to execute (Source: I did something very similar for my graduate work).

The images posted above are more complex.  For paintings, it gets a lot more complicated simply because of the vastly different styles.  Each painter had his/her own unique painting style such that one image can be interpreted so many different ways.  It's impossible to list all the different work in this field, but here are some papers which describe how we got the images posted:

- [Mean Curvature Flow] (http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0729052)
- [Flow-based bilateral filter] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.5240&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- [Non-linear diffusion] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56205&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D56205)

There really are a TON more papers and the ones listed are relevant to the images posted.  Suffice to say, this is an emerging field, and while not ""perfect"", we are getting closer to non-photorealistic images.

If there's more interest, I'm happy to provide additional examples or (attempt) to explain the theory behind them!  This is an exciting time to work in digital images!

I bet the photographer got a ton of points from Professor Oak for that pic.My mom is obsessed with this animal. It's her profile picture on every social media platform. She makes me call her Pika sometimes and calls me Pika as well. It's confusing.

Edit: [yup](http://i.imgur.com/Hqi7vcb.jpg)I just read about this thing. It's more endangered than the panda. The Chinese call it a Magic Rabbit.>Native to the Xinjiang region of China, there are only 1,000 of these tiny, cute creatures, known as the Ili pika, left.

>Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat further up the mountain peaks.The name of it comes from the name of area where it's found, Ili Prefecture (which is actually a shortened version). 

There's so little information because of how elusive it is so we can't currently determine causes of its endangerment. The area is somewhat mountainous as you can see in the picture, perhaps they just fall off and die or some shit.Pika Pika.Imagine how lucky one of those feet would be...

* entire house addition on the right side. 
* front door relocated. 
* eavestrough added all around. 
* chimney appears to be moved further back, but that might just be perspective. 
* addional window added downstairs. 
* lighting added near the corners of the house. 
* siding is horizontal now instead of vertical.

Great on him for fixing up the house .At first I was like, *why didn't you take this from the same angle*, but then I realized the entire part on the right is essentially new. That's some serious renovation work. Very sharp lookingI love how the additions actually fit the architectural style of the house. So many shitty additions look like shitty additions.My uncle was only a carpenter as a hobby but his and my aunt's house is the same way.  It started out as a 1 bedroom house about as big a as a double wide trailer.  They've added 2 bedrooms, a den with a second story master bedroom above it, and a 2 car garage.  He's probably tripled the square footage.  Not to mention the couple of big storage sheds and deck he's also built in the back yard.That's a great looking house.I honestly really like the second window he added on the face of the house facing the camera You've got to be more than a carpenter to pull that off!

It's been in ruins for a thousand years and not like they had pictures to go offA little more info on the display:

This display at Carnuntum is the only one of its kind on this site. It is even meant as a temporary display since sooner or later the Heidentor (heathen's gate) is supposed to be rebuilt following original Roman building style.

They have a very nice museum at the excavation site nearby where they already have a few fully functional Roman buildings that were rebuilt in the original style and with original materials.

Carnuntum is a fascinating excavation site with a very cleverly built museum which constantly improves.

During summer they have some festivities there and at their sister site ""Bad Deutsch Altenburg"". They show Gladiator fights, Roman army training, Roman lifestyle in general.

The site is about half an hour drive from Vienna and definitely worth a visit. Entry fees are moderate and the ticket is valid for the three main sites: Museum Carnuntum, Museum Bad Deutsch Altenburg, and the ""Amphitheater"" Bad Deutsch Altenburg.What if ruins have always been in the state they are now?

I asked the vet about the behavior because I was worried about my dog (even though he has his shots) and they said that while it *could* mean that they're sick, some just like to do stuff during the day. so it doesn't necessarily mean they're sick.

Cal. Dept. of Water Resources is letting out so much water from the lake in order to keep salinity levels of the delta in check. When they dropped the flow down too far, salt water from the San Francisco Bay started to creep in. There are multiple reasons for this, one being environmental (the Delta Smelt...) and irrigation purposes. Although it's part of it, California, or rather, Folsom and Sacramento, are NOT drinking this lake dry.

Guess I won't be going back to Sacramento anytime soonThe kids can still play on the beach, just without the splashing around in water part...Looks like New VegasI'd be metal detecting the hell out of that place""No lifeguard on duty...*forever*""It's worth pointing out that people only used to swim there because some people dug a reservoir and dammed a river. It's not a natural lake. California has been living on borrowed water for a long time. No one should be surprised when the bill comes due.Drought is part of the natural water cycle in California. Yes, people expanded to where they shouldn't have, without better backup systems in place. Yes, we are have a particularly bad drought right now.

I don't exactly know how this cultural attitude changed, but people scoff at big projects these days. Covering the CA aquaduct with solar panels, for instance. Or William Shatner's proposed super-long pipeline. Folks should also look up NAWAPA, a plan in the 50's to do man-made water distribution throughout the western US. Hell, even William Shatner proposed a super-long pipeline of a similar nature.

Astonishingly, the notion of long pipelines immediately invokes visions of science fiction in people's minds. Then when you point out that the petrochem industry makes *colossal* pipelines all the time, that is somehow considered irrelevant.

I will immediately betray what I said above, though: this isn't a usual cycle, and we are seeing something change. The Salton Sea was left to die, and it is have a ripple effect in the ecosystem all along the coast. The desertification of the LA region was essentially halted with the creation of the Salton Sea 100 years ago. The existence of the sea sustained weather systems that made the LA region much more livable. Now that the sea is essentially gone, the greater LA area is undergoing a drastic desertification, with soaring temperatures and exposure.

The sea could be saved, too, but again, people scoff at it. A 90 mile seawater pipeline could be built from the Gulf of California to refill the Salton Sea. Cost estimates are somewhere in the $500m-1b range. Scoffing ensues, but you can look at school districts that issues bonds in the hundreds-of-millions range that are just absorbed into people's pockets. If you listen to Eisenhower and compare to military spending, $1b is a small investment compare to military build-up.

... and seawater is actually less salty than the Sea is now! The Sea is 200 feet below sea level, and the pipeline could be passive, if designed correctly. There is a huge dry lake bed in Mexico that could be refilled to an artificial sea, too, if the pipeline was properly built. A little tricky, since it is 80 feet above seal level, but by coupling it to to the -200ft Salton Sea siphon could also make this a passive benefit.

Even if pumping was added, solar or thermal collectors could be added along the length of the pipe, thus making it zero net energy. The economic benefit alone to both countries would likely offset the cost within a decade. The biggest problem would be dealing with Mexico, now that they are a essentially a failed nation.Kids these days have no imagination.

They come from my great-uncle, who did serve in the 201st squadron. I am just a distant nephew, and my uncle's family treasures all these memories, not just as memento, but also because they, and my family (my father served with them in a special forces group) still serve to this day with a lot of pride and honor, and with this legacy in mind.


You'd be healthily skeptic to doubt me in light of all the drug trafficking, corruption and violence levels in the country, even within the military; but boy, would I be fucking damned if I let anyone slip every Mexican soldier under that umbrella.



The stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.


The reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:


Mexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.

You can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.



But just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.


It could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.


Sure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.



Let's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.

I just got patriotic for a country I am not from. I guess propoganda works.Great post OP. On a similar note, Alot of mexican americans fought in WWII but at the time there was only ""white or black"" on the census. Natrually mexicans where considered white (and many still do idenfity as such).

 This is part of why i enjoyed fury because it really made effort to be accurate in what was out there./r/propagandaposters has tons of stuff like this.'Muric...I mean...'Mexica?!Notice the two mountains in the background? Those are actually volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. They are very important to Aztec mythology. Legend has it Iztaccihuatl was an Aztec princess who fell in love with Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl was sent off to war, she was falsely told by her father that her beloved had died in battle, so in turn she died of grief. When the warrior returned to find his lover dead, he laid her to rest and kneeled beside her body to mourn her death.Here's a good write up on the 201st squadron. [Strike of the Aztec Eagles] (http://www.airartnw.com/aztec_eagles_story.htm) I picked a up a print a while back with the signatures of the few remaining pilots. If I were a Nazi - I'd be wondering where the rattlesnake went.  As I learned from WWE, don't turn your back on a rattlesnake.Aaaaand.... I have a new wallpaper vMexico declared war on the Axis Powers in support of the Allies on May 22, 1942, following losses of oil ships in the Gulf, most notably the Potrero del Llano and the Faja de Oro, to German submarine attacks. Although most American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and Brazil were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.

Perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the Mexican military was the Escuadrón 201, also known as the Aztec Eagles. This group consisted of more than 300 volunteers, who trained in the United States to fight against Japan. It was the first Mexican military unit trained for overseas combat.

Crane must have bounced right offCrane operator here!

After a bit of sleuth work I've found the load charts for the crane in the accident. From the information I've found the crane is a Leibherr LR1300 with 555' of boom. 
https://www.coastcrane.com/docs/default-source/lr1300/lr1300---2316-luffing-jib-capacity-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=2
Looking over the manual, with the configuration this crane was running, it was a limit of 15 mph winds. Reports are there were easily 30mph gusts(probably more between this buildings). 
This is all based on speculation and none of it is a fact, just felt like looking into it. Glad it wasn't worse than what it was!

I lived in NYC for a long time, and this is one of those things that I just never think about.  So many buildings are always under construction, and so many cranes are just sitting above you.

It's terrifying to think about.

Somebody has painted an abstract mural on it. Two trolls are minding their own business at the north end.

\>Go north. 

The trolls have taken notice of you and draw their weapons. It took me a while to focus my eyes and see the bridge.No Man's BridgeReal Life Monument Valley.I don't ever wanna feel *~~how~~ like* I did that day.

I was in high school, and the rest of my family was away at some farming convention for the weekend. I was out on the back porch and placed a tab under my tongue. Based on everything I had read and heard, I had done some meditation and relaxation exercises to try and reach as calm and steady a state as possible. I kind of wanted a spiritual sort of experience.

About 45 minutes after I took it, I really started to focus on my breathing. I could feel my skin merging with the air, and everything felt very solid, and whole. Until, that is, I opened my eyes. At that point, the clouds seemed to part, and the sky split open. The sun became a giant pixelated Mario head, and tried to eat me. I ran back inside, but was lucid enough to realize I wasn't okay. I didn't want to risk making a mess of my parents house, so I went back outside and ran straight for the neighbor's house.

They were growing a bunch of egg plants out back. For some reason, I thought the egg plants looked kind of like old-timey bombs, and I felt like I had to disarm them. Of course, this meant picking them all. Their fuses were still burning though, so I did the only thing I could think of: I pissed all over them. It put out the fuses, but the neighbor's wife came running out and beat the shit out of me with a dirty pair of trousers.So, I actually *was* under this bridge a while ago, and for people wondering, it still looks fantastic. People have respected the murals around the city that this artist has done and it really brightens up my day whenever I see one.

>The landing caused the plane to sustain major damage,[7] and it was written off shortly after the incident.[8] A passenger on board the plane said that the aircraft broke into three parts after landing.[9] Later reports said that both the cockpit and vertical stabilizer had separated from the aircraft, and that the wings and undercarriage had both been damaged.[3]

I remember those days. I got so pumped to get a Princess Diana beanie baby. What's it worth now? Probably jack shit. Poor couple. 

Edit: Just to clarify,

""Pumped to get"" entails being 12 and having one thrown at me out the window of a car by the kid who's mom owned a local toy store. He had boxes full and to be one of the people to catch one was indescribable. It felt like I just got tossed a chunk of gold. I'm just trying to figure out which one's gonna get $14.56 and which one's gonna get the $14.57.This is a really beautiful photograph. It's so raw. These adults seem to have forgotten they are in a courtroom picking their pieces of their broken marriage. 

They look just like children, but all grown up. The gentleman challenged his ex-wife's custodial rights to their Tomagatchi when he found no less than 4 poops on the screen during his court-supervised visit.It would be hilarious if in a few decades Beanie Babies started auctioning for hundreds of dollars each simply because so many people threw away their ""worthless collectibles"". And everyone(me included) that made fun of them were mad because they didn't buy them when they could.Just wait till they get to the pokemon cardsNever thought I'd open reddit to see my aunt and uncle on the front page. It is just as embarrassing now as it was then. Buying Beanie Babies on eBay was the most 1999 thing you could possibly doFor the curious, [here's](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/beanie_babies_bubble_economics_and_psychology_of_a_plush_toy_investment.html) the article I found the picture in.Both must cringe at the sight of this now. Man, I know too much about Beanie babies, and it sticks in my head like a steal trap. A few years ago, a girl said to me, ""my birthday is on November 6, and I said to her, you share a birthday with Pouch the Kangaroo."" So, for anyone who doubts what I'm about to say, I think I have the ruinous resume for this.

This collection of Beanies is hilariously terrible. Almost none of these were ever of any value. I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, so it's clear that these two were collecting to strike it rich. They weren't collecting just to have them. I see a lot of Legs the frogs. They had a little bit of value at one point, and when Chocolate the moose retired (which you can see a couple of, it jumped in value a little as well. But they were not big money makers. It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow. Rainbow and Iggy were released with their tags switched and body parts all messed about. There were a couple releases of each before Ty got it right. That said, it's pretty clear that she knows what she's doing, and he might be a moron. In her pile in th elower left hand corner, she has a Flip the cat, and (I think though it's hard to say for sure) a Dotty the Dalmation. Those two were pretty valuable after they were retired. Probably the most valuable in this collection presuming that the Lucky the Ladybug sitting in the middle of the pile is a later generation version of the Beanie. Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time. If it's a Doodle, I'm guessing at the time, I'd grab that. If it's a Strut, I'd go for the Crunch the Shark. In the end, Crunch would have been better, but Doodle was what everyone was speculating on.Not even Beanie Baby collectors can stand to be around Beanie Baby collectors.Apparently putting your hand to your face and sticking your finger on your mouth was quite the fad in 1999.I don't even care.  I'll say it.  As a kid who loved stuffed animals, these things were the shit.  There was one for just about any animal you could want.  Played with these things every day till I grew out of them.  Think they're still in a box in a closet somewhere around here.Can you imagine the Judge going home after this?

Why are kids microwaving pot noodles in school?he seems kinda young to be teaching at a high schoolBe careful! There's a wet floor somewhere, now.I have a feeling were going to find out this kids name is Kevin.Not a coincidence. [Zoom in a bit](https://imgur.com/IHMtZeW)[deleted]""Instant Noodle/Regret Kid""

He has a name you know.....Hello! I know this is alittle late but whatever. So I am currently a student at said school and I'm not gonna say which one cause well I'm not a noodle head (hah good one) but as far as I know the story goes that this kid is one of the athletic coaches sons (not sure which sport, there are lots at my school) and one day during his dad's practice he decided to get instant noodles from our concessions stand that's open every day after school, kid gets the noodles puts some water in the cup and thinks ""30 secs for this bitch would be dope as fuck."" Kid pops open the microwave puts 30 seconds on the microwave and goes back to watching his dad coach. The only problem was that he put them on for 30 mins instead of seconds, forgets about them and comes back 28 mins and 50 secs later to find that his noodles became disappointmentles. He became somewhat of a living legend at our school and everyone loves and adores him. He even gave himself a nick name ""noodle-boy"" a ton of people call him that and he's kinda embraced the whole thing. Cool kid. Gave me some skin after my cross country practice once so now I can say that I literally touched a meme.Liar! The gray and black cords in the background are reversed!Everyone's asking about the kid,and I'm like ""holy shit i have that exact same stereo!""...What does he teach, Memes 101?is there still a fry in front of the microwave?[deleted]Is the kid still black?this exact picture was posted in a facebook group called ""post aesthetics"" yesterday. i think op jacked it and is a liar.

There were some pretty decent storms around last night, I was further east than that so they weakened a bit by the time they reached me.Why do you get all the karma, while I was fucking [on it](http://imgur.com/m10FqZc,B5g3ybz,82OzyDd)This us a good reason why flights are delayed or cancelled. Airlines and the military have strict policies regarding weather conditions at takeoff and arrival, and weather enroute. Flying through thunderstorms deliberately is a pretty big no no in most cases, and when squall lines can be hundreds of miles long, it can cause a lot of problems.

Remember that the next time someone complains about weather delays or cancellations.. ask if they actually want to fly in weather the pilots don't even want to.am i the only one who for a second thought this would be a Delta flight pic from 1889Hi All. I was on this flight. I assure you, it was not a fun ride. 
http://m.imgur.com/OLjcpcUAt least the front didn't fall off, then we would have to tow it out of the atmosphere In the meantime some poor maintainer took a look at the aircraft and is slightly pissed. Came here to see a busted up plane. Ended up learning so much about aircraft I could probably get a job in aircraft repair. That's gotta be terrifying. I wonder how calm the pilots had to be to keep the passengers calm. 

[Looks like they had to make an emergency landing.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3190510/Delta-flight-make-blind-emergency-landing-hail-storm-gives-plane-cracked-windshield-damaged-nose.html) That's some Day After Tomorrow shit.I like to imagine the pilot pulled an Ace Ventura and hung his head out the window catching hail in his teeth like bullets.That'll buff right out.Recording of the radio between Delta 1889 and ATC.

Now for sale on Craigslist:
Airbus A320 with mild paint chipping on the nose cone due to ish weather. Will easily buff out.

Get outta here Buzzfeed.This may be a stupid question but, can't they see oncoming thunderstorms/hailstorms on their weather radar and take evasive action, change course etc? I can't believe that a hailstorm like this just pops out of nowhere.You can see in this graphic that pilots tried to fly between towo super cells and one of them closed in quicker than they thought

as I sit on a delta plane over the ocean, fuck this shit.[deleted]I posted this 24 hours before and no one noticed it :(
What am I doing wrongHail can actually be encountered flying between 2 storms.  As it is can be violently thrown out of the clouds.  Now, couple that with the aircraft flying at say 400 knots and you can see the reason how and why this fucked up the plane so bad.  It's also highly advised to keep a safe distance between storm so this doesn't happen.

Source:  I am a pilotThus actually makes me feel better about air travel.As I sit on a Delta flight, getting ready to taxi, I find this less than comfortingAs an engineer myself, if I were on that flight I would write a well-thought-out thank-you letter openly addressed to all of the staff at ~~Boeing~~ Airbus for taking the time to design, test, and build aircraft to take this type of abuse and still get me down on the ground in one piece.

Then I'd write another letter to Delta, thanking them for hiring the calibre of pilots that will land a plane in this condition and get me down on the ground in one piece.  I know that the pilots also have a vested interest in getting me down in one piece, but that's beside the point.","[0.984637, 0.34562, 0.463114, 0.043212, 0.064535, 0.016, 0.0, 0.708, 0.423, 0.052, 0.4, 0.334, 0.896]"

A regular guy who selflessly brought joy to sick children.

RIP man.  I'm really sorry to hear of his passing.

I think it would be nice if the makers of the Batman games and movies gave him a nod.

He was a real hero.Waking up to learn there's one less hero in the world made me suddenly feel very tired again. Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.So he pulled onto the left shoulder, but his car was still partially in the lane and somebody hit him. I wonder if his hazards were on, because that car is jet black and would be really hard to spot at night.I met this guy last year almost to the day. My daughter has a leg length discrepancy and we were at a specialist hospital in Baltimore and he was there giving all the kids lanyards and huge coloring books. We were really looking forward to seeing him again next month when we went back. R.I.P.According to the stories I've read, Mr. Robinson would stop by the nurse's station before he left to find out if there were any children too sick to come out to see him, so that he could make sure to go in to see them specifically.

That's the key to his character.  This wasn't about attention or fame or publicity or promoting some cause of business.  We wouldn't know who this guy was if he hadn't gotten a speeding ticket and accidentally gone viral.  He kept right on doing the same thing after he got famous as he did before he got famous.  And the most important thing to him was that sick kid who wasn't able to come out to see him.

Bruce Wayne is a fiction; an entertaining fiction, but a fiction.  Lenny Robinson was a real man who is a role model for thoughtfulness, selflessness, and making a difference in a small way.

Batman was real, and his name was Lenny Robinson.Here is a video of Lenny visiting sick kids in the hospital.  He truly was a hero deserving of the name, Batman.  The world is a darker place without him.   RIP Batman.

https://youtu.be/fDDBJajLZwwLenny was in a documentary called Legends of the Knight that is on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/80014903) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/795787), if anyone wants to check out his story and see him in action. It's about people who use Batman as an inspiration for themselves or others.

Seeing the kids respond to him is incredible. The world lost a great man.Batman taken out by a Toyota Camry.  This world is fucked up.Too bad it wasn't [this guy instead](http://i.imgur.com/IMc8Kiv.jpg)A tad late to things, but Lenny was actually very close to one of my best friends and his family. A group of my friends (whom all play SSBM together, shouts out to /r/smashbros and the Melee Community) all learned of Lenny's passing this morning straight from our buddy. Although the loss was hard for him and his family, I feel its important to highlight the good that Lenny put into this world. Admittedly, I did not know Lenny nearly as closely as my friend or his family, but I do recall a very specific memory I had with Lenny a couple years ago. At my friend's Bar Mitzvah Lenny was there decked out in full batman attire. He was a class act by all definitions, and went out of his way to make sure every kid, myself included had a memorable experience. An entertaining, genuine, loving individual, Lenny aka Uncle Batman will be missed. RIP Uncle Batman. He was a hero this world needed.

Proof: My friend, the dopest Marth/Fox main in the world with his partner in justice Uncle Batman. Although they weren't technically related, Lenny was considered part of his family.

...so help me jesusIf there is an afterlife, he's going to the good side of town. He clearly lived a cool life if he had the money to buy a lambo and a batsuit. He then had the heart to use that for a greater good and in the process gave us all some laughs. RIP Lenny.Such a shame, my son was in a children's hospital and this gentleman was there with his 60's Batmobile that he had recently purchased and was driving back east with.  Got some pics of the [Batmobile](http://i.imgur.com/nKnRe63.jpg?1) and my son still has his [autograph](http://i.imgur.com/XlrPgMI.jpg) hanging up in his room.  
He not only put some smiles on the kids faces but also everyone at the hospital that went out to check out the car.  He was the Hero we needed that day.*batman voice* just here in my garage, with my new Lamborghini that I bought. Fun to drive around Gotham. You know what I like better than Lamborghini's...JUSTICEThats terrible. He's more of a hero than the guy he was dressed as and probably never realized it. RIP Lenny. You were a Batman among men.i live in maryland. i can not tell you how many times since i got my license over 20 years ago now,  the countless people that have been killed by their cars breaking down and them getting out and standing near their car on the side of the road, attempting to change a flat tire, or are under the hood checking the engine. 95 percent of the time these people are safely out of the driving lanes and yet people still manage to hit them. im telling you now for anyone who doesnt know about maryland: 

MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.

ive never seen worse drivers. and ive lived in huge cities. it is the worst here for accidents like this one. it is the reason why we have the highest insurance rates in the united states. if you have the unfortunate problem of living here or for some ungodly reason decide to visit here as a tourist im going to give you a little advice: 

- IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDIAN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE WALL, AND IF THERE IS GRASS BY THE MEDIAN PULL ALL THE WAY OVER INTO THE GRASS!

- NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR CAR ON A MARYLAND HIGHWAY TO CHANGE A TIRE OR LOOK AT YOUR ENGINE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  IF YOU HAVE A FLAT DRIVE IT ON THE SIDE MEDIAN UNTIL YOU CAN FIND AN EXIT. EVEN IF IT MEANS DAMAGING YOUR RIM. YOUR RIM IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE. 

- IF IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR CANNOT BE FIXED DO NOT SIT IN YOUR CAR WAITING UNTIL HELPS ARRIVES!! EVEN IF YOU ARE SAFELY OFF TO THE SIDE. PEOPLE HERE WILL STILL HIT YOU! GET OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE AND STAND AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENCING, BUT YOU'LL BE ALIVE. PEOPLE DIE IN THEIR CARS HERE ALL THE TIME SITTING IN THEM WAITING FOR HELP OR A TOW TRUCK. 

again i reiterate, MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.  take every precaution you can if your car breaks down on a highway here. And a positive light in the world goes out. sad day. Met this guy in person when a psychology practice with which I'm affiliated co-produced a batman documentary. He was a hero who happened to dress up like another hero.

Legit cried when I learned of his passing.*We die every day. A thousand times an hour. Anyone who does this work sees it. Death. Their own... their partner's... their loved ones. We go to work anyway. Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind. Death is powerless against you if you do your job.*
- Batman, JLA Vol 1 72Karma did the opposite here. What a shame. The person who caused his death needs to do the right thing and take over for Lenny Robinson as Batman.>Elizabeth later told him that she was being bullied by other kids at her elementary school. “They don’t believe that Batman is my friend,” she told him.  So, Robinson went to school with her, appearing in full costume before the student body. He told them bullying was wrong and called her onstage to give her a Batman necklace.  Elizabeth, he announced, is my friend.

> It has been said that the Ankh is the only river in the multiverse where cops can draw a chalk outline when a corpse is found. 

>There is a legend in Ankh-Morpork of an ancient drum in the palace that will bang itself if ever an enemy fleet is seen sailing up the Ankh, although the legend has died out in recent centuries, partly because it's the Age of Reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the Ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front.There's something alive in there!

Edit: I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but that flashy building behind is one of the many overpriced white elephants our corrupt government has built with money that should be put to better use, built especially for the Olympics.

I used to work at a coal fired power plant. The plant had tall stacks that peregrines would nest at every year, which was cool because they were endangered at the time. One day, I'm working on the roof on an AC unit and my coworker and I spot 2 peregrines flying past us. We stop and watch them for a second and we notice that 1 of them has something in his talons (a mouse or something we assumed). Then out of nowhere, right in front of us, the one with the mouse flies upside down, the other one grabs the mouse out of his talons, and then he flips back and they continue on into the distance. Makes me wonder how many people have ever seen something like that.

EDIT: Cool I didn't expect to get so much visibility on this!
Bonus Story: I took a break on the 10th floor and the falcons were nesting above where I was standing. They started gawking and divebombing at me because I guess their nest was nearby.Write a book about it called My Side of the SkyscraperFalcony?Humans can barely afford a walk-up with a shared bathroom in Chicago. How the Hell does a single income falcon afford a one bedroom with a nursery and a view?I like the how Hawks faces is like

Hopefully they'll be back next year"" sooo, is this going to be an issue or something?"" ""excuse me sir these are my fluffs and I'm going to have to ask you to take a few steps back""We have a peregrine falcon family that lives right above us in an apartment in Brooklyn. What I've learned over the past few years:

* The male (I assume) is as bad as a rooster in the mornings and will not shut up.
* They shit constantly. There are times in the summer when we pray for a good rain to clean off our terrace and there are often lovely white streaks down the sides of our windows.
* They are merciless murderers of pigeons.
* They do not like to eat the heads of pigeons. They are happy leaving those as little presents for us to try and keep our dog from eating.
* They will chirp kind of cutely outside a window from time to time.
* People like hearing about the falcon family that lives above you right up until they see a decapitated pigeon right in front of them that we hadn't noticed and cleaned up.
It's not the photographer's balcony, btw. The guy living there let the photographer and the photographer's girlfriend stay with him for a little bit to get the photos though.That is the fastest bird................... in the world.*LET'S GO HAWKS!*>The account caught the eye of Luke Massey as he lounged one night in his camper van near Venray, the Netherlands, scrolling through Instagram after a full day filming beavers.

Edit: NVM, it was *Twilight.*I used to work at bookstore. My proudest moment was when someone came in looking for a book... they couldn't remember anything except that it was pink. I found it.I worked as a librarian for a few years, and we got this kind of question quite often. 

""I forget the name, but it's yellow.""

Not sure what it's like now, but back then (20+ years ago... jeez I'm old) 90% of the time it was the book Oprah had talked about that day/week/month (I don't recall if she had her ""book club"" at the time or not, because I was a teenage male who did not own a television so 3 strikes against giving a shit about her show). 

If I recall correctly the ""green cover book"" was the Celestine Prophecy, the ""outside party after dark"" book was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Why do I recall these things... because I was asked the same question (more or less) a hundred times. 

This was before everyone had a cell phone, much less a smartphone, so there wasn't an easy way to ""look it up"" (this was when you still had to buy Netscape). I recall a particularly terrible manager of mine responding to my suggestion that we ""make an Oprah's books"" table to help people that I should instead ""expand my knowledge beyond the classics and computer books by watching Oprah regularly.""

We would be ecstatic if you could add a caption or comment to this post mentioning our name and our website bluewillowbookshop.com!!The Fault in Our Stars isn't  in there.One time I was at a fairly large Indigo book store looking for a book I'd seen before online.  Of course I couldn't remember the name of it or the author, so I was just skimming through the section I thought it would be in.  A lady that worked there asked me if I needed help, and I was almost going to just tell her I was fine because I thought there's no way she can help me find this book.  But, i thought what the hell, let's give it a shot.  So i told what I remembered about the book, which was basically that it was 'kinda sciency' and 'had a red triangle on the front'.  She took a second to think about it, then ""Oh yeah, it's over here""  and then she took me a couple rows over, reaches down to the bottom shelf and pulls out the book I was looking for.

Did she just know where every book was?

Was she magic?Twist, all those covers are just dust jackets for other booksOh hell no. This actually happened. Couldn't tell me the name, what it was about our who wrote it but they had seen their friend's copy and it was (kid you not) blue. 

45 minutes of talking about the types of books the friend liked and narrowing it down slowly I found the fucking book. 

They looked at it, said ""oh, yeah. That's what it was called. Thanks"" and walked out of the store without buying a damn thing. 

Fuck that person. If it's have had a weapon, I'd have gone to jail. As a former B&N employee I can concur. This happened way too often, or they would have oddly specific irrelevant information. ""I'm looking for a book. It's got a tree on the cover and is 357 pages long."" 

My other favorite thing was when they would just say ""I'm looking for a book."" I would then grab the nearest book to me, hand it to them, and walk off.

What they are doing is forming what we call a ""rub nest"". A rub nest is when 2 or more LBs come together and ""lick"" each others faces (fun fact LBs have tongues almost 1/3 the length of their bodies!) and mouths to share nutrients and more importantly, build each other's immune systems by sharing antibodies with one another. They will stay like this for hours at a time, licking each others faces until their immunity are bolstered and they can no longer become sick and die.

Long ago the 4 nations of ladybugs lived in harmony.....Red & Black... Yellow Shell... Red Dots... Solid. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Red Dot Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

But maybe there's some comfort in knowing he helped so many others, which would be a feat for anyone, let alone an 11-year-old. He was still a child, and it would have been absolutely understandable if he'd thought of himself first. Very powerful picture.Signing up to be an organ donor is basically the easiest thing you can do to help save lives -- everyone should be an organ donor. This little boy is an example to us all.holy shit, death being the catalyst of life. no better way to end one's journey than by allowing others to continue theirs. My sister passed away recently.  She was an organ donor, and everyone involved in that process was incredibly respectful, compassionate, and above all grateful for her decision.  She saved the lives of several people directly, provided organs for research, and tissues which could wind up helping 100s of people.  As bad as it all was, it's some small comfort knowing that her death wound up helping others.[More information about this great human being in case anyone is interested.] (http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/11-year-old-chinese-boy-donates-organs-to-save-others.html)I always thought you couldn't donate if you had cancer?Relevant XKCD :

http://xkcd.com/659/To see these people bowing to a boy donating his organs, is such a powerful image. I got chills all over my body. the respect they have is so immense.Much respect to this young guy.I find it amazing how something as simple as a few people arching their backs in your direction can mean more than a thousand words of thanks.  
It's like a primitive way of showing appreciation from before we were able to communicate with words.  
It's also great seeing such a positive piece about China. Seems to be in an almost permanent state of negativity these days.  
Respect.I'm not sure if this is relevant, but here goes: 

My close friend took his life three months after he turned 22. Everyone was devastated and so caught off guard. He was so loved. Anyway, during his funeral I was so upset that I didn't think there was anything that could be said that could take away my grief. Well, I was wrong. He was an organ donor. They were able to use pretty much every single organ from the neck down and his eyes. The pastor of the funeral told us that because of his death, his eyes allowed a child to see for the first time. Whoever that kid was is so lucky, his eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue. Miss you, buddy.

 There's nothing that can take the pain away, but I hope for this child's family, the knowledge that he has given others a new chance will help. This will probably get buried but when I was in high school I had a friend who suffered brain damage after being hit by a car while he was crossing the street. He lived for the following three days before his death. He, too, was an organ donor, and the day after his death a story was reported of an anonymous 18 year old boy who had donated his liver to save a young girl. We all knew it was his. Following his death he donated any organ possible, from his heart to his kidneys to his corneas. He was a healthy young man whose death made an immediate and powerful impact on other people's lives. It's a sad but bittersweet story that I'll never forget. Most of the school followed through and became organ donors soon thereafter. RIP Robb. fuck...its too early to feelHere's the whole story in Chinese with more photos, if you guys are interested in, I will try to give a brief translation

Edit: Very rough one, please forgive any typos and grammar mistakes

The boy’s name is **Yaoyi Liang**. He came to Shenzhen (close to Guangzhou) 2 years ago with his older brother and sister, who are seeking jobs in this metropolitan.

04/12/2014, his sister noticed Yaoyi was having slight movement disorder, and even fell out one time. Yaoyi was sent to hospital immediately next morning, the examination told that it was brain cancer. The family originally thought modern medical technology could save the little boy, however, after 2 surgeries on 04/16 and 05/08 respectively, things didn't get any better.

Yaoyi had been dreaming to become an astronautic scientist/engineer before he was diagnosed the illness. However he changed his mind, he hoped that if he could recover, he would try his best to be a doctor to help relieving the pain of others. During the period, he showed incredible maturity, never really complains the pain but tried to comfort his mother. 

When it came into June, Yaoyi himself seemed to realize it was coming to the end. He said to his mom:” if I can’t survive, please donate my body.” The family came from rural area in China, his mom who was under-educated, can’t really get what her boy was talking about. And then she realized. At the beginning, his sister was strongly against the idea, as per Chinese tradition, it is peaceful only when whole body is buried. After some time, the family understood, that was also another form of living in this world.

06/06, 11:45 AM, Guangzhou Zhongshan 1st Hospital, relatives of Yaoyi were called; 4:35 pm, Yaoyi peacefully passed away. 5:19pm, Yaoyi’s kidney and liver were collected, and would have transplant to others within 8 hours to save their lives. Yaoyi has become the 142th multi-organ donator in Shenzhen.
I wasn't aware that cancer patients could donate their organs. Are there not concerns about unknown metastasis, circulating tumour cells or circulating free DNA?

Edit: I read further into the thread and this is discussed, never mind! What was his name? This picture is amazing and this child deserves the dignity of his name being known Way to go kid. I'm very proud of youEvery day I come to Reddit for laughs and leave with tears. Reddit is the first ten minutes of Up in constant loop. My grandma received a heart from a young man who died when dove off a pier.  This was in the 90s and they told her she only had about 5 years to live with it and everyone else who did the program.  Thankfully she was given another 18 years.  This was enough to see me be born and grow up. Although she unfortunately passed away a year before I graduated high school, I am so glad I got to know her.  Without someone donating their organs that would have never happened.  Every year my grandma would have a second birthday on the young man that gave her the heart's birthday.  She would go to his grave and release a heart shaped balloon.  Powerful. I wish it was higher resolution so I could frame it and hang it up at my uni accommodation. Pictures like this push me through med school.An 11 year old makes the decision to save as many lives as he can, in the face of impending death. I can't get most full grown adults I know to make a reasonable decision if their life depended on it. This young... child, hero, saint... whatever you call him, had little knowledge and experience of many of the truly wonderful joys and experiences of life, yet was wise enough, and kind enough to ensure others to get a chance he never will. Its much too bad that with type of selflessness and concern for fellow man this child held, that he didn't get many more years to make the world a better place. We need more people like him.I haven't felt this sensation of moisture coming out of my eyes in a while. It's not sadness, it's more a deep sense of respect and admiration.

I was in Seattle for business last summer. The first 4 days I was there, the weather was what you think of as typical for Seattle: grey and cloudy.

On the morning of my 5th day there, the clouds cleared out and it became sunny, so I went for a walk around the building I was working in, as I had done every day. 

I turned the corner of this building and I was totally taken by surprise by Mt. Rainier just appearing on the horizon. I'd looked in that direction the last 4 days and seen nothing, so I was so shocked by the size of it. It looked totally fake, towering over the landscape by itself, and I just stood there, staring at it for about the next 5 minutes. It was one of the most beautiful and awe inducing things I ever seen.

The clouds can block it from view for weeks at a time.  Friends kept saying that Ranier hasn't come out yet. My response was ""how will I know when I see it?""
""Oh, you'll know."" You don't realize how huge the thing is until you see it for yourself!
so if Mt. Ranier is 60 miles away from Seattle, and a pyroclastic flow travels at 500 mph, and Bob, who is having lunch at Pike Place  stares at the beautiful exploding mountain for 30 seconds before running to his car which just happens to be right outside, how far can Bob get before he's suffocated by searing gas and choking ash as he watches the city disappear? Extra credit for what kin of car he's driving. Brilliant photo!

If anyone is wondering, you get this type of effect by using a zoom lens (like 200 or 300mm) and zooming in, which makes images in the distance appear much bigger. Photos like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/rEIhvQt.jpg) are also created with this method.

>""I feel that I should mention that this is not a normal living area. These houses are called ""Kolonihavehuse"". They are small houses, about 30-40 m^2, with a garden. People who live in the city sometimes have these to have a little undisturbed garden somewhere. The houses usually have a living room, bathroom and a small kitchen.

Seems only fair after locking him away for that long""Yeeeeaaaaah, we're real sorry about that one""He's the third Ohio man exonerated after being wrongly accused of the 1975 murder. Imprisoned after the testimony of a 13 year old witness who recanted his testimony last year, saying he was coerced by detectives at the time.

""Kwame Ajamu, 56, was the last of three men exonerated in the 1975 robbery and murder of a Cleveland-area money order salesman. Ajamu was originally sentenced to death, but it was vacated because of a paperwork error. He later earned parole in 2003."" Only now being exonerated of all charges. 

The two other accused, Ajamu's brother, Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Ricky Jackson, 57, were released from prison last month after 39 years. 

Defense attorney Terry Gilbert said that Cuyahoga County prosecutors took a courageous stand not to fight the dismissal of charges against the men. Prosecutors also said they won't stop the trio from seeking more than $4.1 million in compensation from their wrongful imprisonments, reported Cleveland.com.

Jesus. That is a looooooong time. Even if I was guilty of a crime I don't know if I could stick it, but *27 years*. I think I'd try killing myself after the first decade.Wow. this doesnt make it better but atleast its not
Oklahoma and he's still alive How people can go through something like that without coming out the other end nearly insane and full of hatred and blood-lust for the pieces of shit that put them there, I don't understand. How can you have 27 years of your life taken from you, not to mention spending those 27 years years in a cage with human scum, and not want vengeance? Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from ToledoThe look on his face says it all. Obviously it's great that he was finally exonerated, but this picture makes me sad. You know in those 27 years he has missed so much of his life. No amount of money could fix it, but he deserves billions. I'm 25, he's been in prison longer than I've been alive. No idea if he has kids, but he definitely has(had?) parents. Imagine losing your family for 27 years. Not to mention everyone you know thinking you're a murderer. So so sad.You would be surprised how many innocent are locked up.The face of a man who has been tried.The look on his face says it all. That's 27 years of pain and anguish for a mistake that wasn't his.That man's face. Holy shitI'll point out the case of Ronald Cotton since it hasn't been mentioned yet. He only received $111,000 from the state of South Carolina after being wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade. His case also showed us a few things about handling witness testimony in law enforcement. Firstly, the victim of the crime had said she dedicated all of her effort during her rape to memorizing her attackers face; she identified cotton with certainty as her attacker, and he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Second, the investigators of her case made affirming statements to her following her indication of cotton as her rapist, causing her to believe her choice was the correct one. There were also inconsistencies in the investigation such as the line-up procedure that was used and an improper alibi given by cotton during his first interrogation being the only other piece of evidence used against him. CBS made a documentary about this story called [picking cotton](http://youtu.be/-2oDRfj0vME)source:

Poor guy. I believe he will be compensated handsomely for wrongful imprisonment though. Won't get him back all those wasted years or ease the pain of missing out on a lot of his life, but at least it should help him restart his life or depending on his age have a nice retirement. Ohio: 
$40,330 per year (or amount determined by state auditor) in addition to lost wages, costs, and attorney's fees. So a minimum of $1,088,910.Wouldn't be surprised if this was another case of false accusation from ""eye witnesses""Has anyone noticed the look on this mans face, or was everyone sidetracked by money talks?  The emotions being expressed here are so complex that just this millisecond snapshot of what he was feeling sent shivers through me.  I'm glad this man was released.  I can't even begin to imagine what sort of indignities this man suffered through for 27 years, but I'm sure no amount of money will ever compensate for it.  wow. Im 28, he spent pretty much all of my life in jail. Ive experienced to much wonder and wildness....all while he was locked up. My heart hurts for these peopleI went to a play called ""The Exonerated"" once about people who were locked up for crimes they didn't commit. People would be shocked and disgusted how often this happens. 

I can't even imagine how this guy feels. Imagine, when he went in it was the '80s. So much has changed and he's just been sitting in a cell. The people who go back and work on getting these people exonerated are really heroes. This is why we shouldn't have a death penalty. Think of all the guys that were extinguished instead of exonerated.That is truly upsetting. Can you even imagine? You did not do this thing, this terrible thing - murder - that they say you did. And then you go to jail for life. The thought that you are going to rot in jail forever for something you did not do. How quickly would you lose all hope? And then 27 years later, maybe after you've relinquished any and all thoughts of a life outside of prison, you come to find that you will be freed. 

All of the emotions he is experiencing, I cannot even fathom. I just want to give him a hug. 

This makes me want to be a lawyer and fight for people who are wrongfully imprisoned. No money can recover what that man lost. 27 years is about how long I've been alive. Think of all that time. He lost his chance at a career. At seeing the rise of the internet and tech. He lost his youth. He lost his reputation, his freedom. He probably lost himself. You don't spend nearly 3 decades in prison and not come out a different man. The system didn't take away 27 years of his life. The system took his soul. The system took everything that he ever was and ever could have been.

What's a million dollars to all of that?As a corrections officer, this is why I treat every person under my care as though they are innocent. Because some of them *are*.Sweater vest.

Growing up near these birds I never thought twice about it.

However, I was surprised to find how many people didn't realize that these birds can fly.

[Here is a video of a peacock in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Gr_0cHlpM)

I've never seen them fly long distances however I have seen them fly to high trees (30+ feet tall).

I've never seen them directly fly to the top of a 30ft tree, usually they fly to the lower branches and I think they just work their way to the top.  

When I visited the Arcadia, CA arboretum, a worker said there is a peacock that can fly and perch itself up on one of its 60+ foot tall trees.

[Here's a very out of focus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaO1vhDyrk) but it does show some context of these birds flying out of pretty tall trees.Peacocks are not graceful, my school had them all over the place and it would really be stretching it to call what they do flying.

They flap their wings like a motherfucker, making all kinds of racket, just to get up onto the roof and then when they decide to come down it's like the god damned Hindenburg.  You hear this loud flapping followed by them crashing down and it's all Oh, the humanity.....""

Like a beautiful bull in a china shop.Ah, the majestic disco turkey! Beautiful!

Thanks for sharing!You gotta let me fly!I don't think I've ever seen one in flight before. They're glorious.Pretty sure that's a pokemonIncidentally, it's terrifying to see this coming at you if you don't know what it is.  I used to work at a zoo, and we had free-roaming peacocks everywhere.  One leapt down from its roost and buzzed over the heads of a group of high school girls, doing it's whole ""ee-AWWWW!"" cry thing.  Those girls screamed and ran like hell was on their heels.  It was one of my favorite things I ever saw at that zoo, heh.Such a  nice but rare picture considering they rarely bother to lift that feathery mass off the ground unless they are chasing a small child.

HOWEVER- personally as a book lover and collector, I would consider them precious. They are a family heirloom, and you can see they were well loved and frequently used. They were owned by someone who loved the words and thoughts inside. The pages are softened and mellowed by use and care. I would cherish them as priceless, whatever their value as an antique Shakespeare library.

No human, far as I could tell, just a german shepherd.

As soon as I walked in, that dog lept off the counter, growling, and ran over to bite me - I thought I was a goner, but it just stood there, holding my pant leg with his teeth.  Then it slowly pulled me towards the door, and I kinda said ""Okay"" and started walking to the door, dog leading me by the pant leg, when I got to the door, it started pushing me.

Still - the neighborhood hardware store is a wonderful place. Little old man or lady who knows where every thing is, even the gizmo they bought in 1947 and never sold. If you have one , cherish it, shop there. Because big box home stores have no souls and often no clue !I hope OP wanted a sprinkler hose, cuz they got one now.Good job pupper. 

Whoops, wrong sub. http://i.imgur.com/xxR7c6P.jpgThere's a gas station in a town I used to live in ran by some hilarious incredibly nice middle eastern dude. He trained his cat to reach out its paw and lower its head to show you respect for a tip, then when you give it a tip it puts it in its mouth (if it's cash) and brings it to him. Or pushes it off the counter into a little red cup if you use change. After that he gives it a treat. 

In Belgium, Wisconsin, the only hardware store in town is also the only liquor store in town.He looks like such a good boy :) I want to give him a treat.Now you can't shop anywhere else ever again. 
*Edit: Can I be someone other than GallowBoob?Do they sell anvils?I grew up in a small town. As a kid I needed a last minute physical so I could play sports in school. Our local doctor wasn't available so we went to an even smaller town nearby where I could see a doctor. The doctor's office had a giant lazy dog lying on the floor of the waiting room. He was breathing so you could tell he was alive but otherwise he gave no indication of life. The doctor was smoking a cigarette with the longest ash imaginable. He asked me, ""Are you healthy?"" I nodded. He said,""ok"" filled out the form and I left. That was the physical.I hope this is true, because that's fuckin' adorable.They used to have seven dogs and a wonderful selection of dark chocolate.Ask him a question please...

Reminds me of a black lab I saw walking with its owner down the high street here in Canterbury. There was an empty plastic bottle on the sidewalk just in front of them. The dog looked up at their owner who then slightly gestured towards the bottle.  Without missing a step, the lab scooped up the bottle and kept on trotting along.  I like to think it carried that bottle all the way home and then dropped it in the recycling bin!

Is it just me or is that one massive dick?Well one thing that is interesting is that Harrison Ford is an able handyman and carpenter. Early on after he moved to Los angeles to do Radio voice overs he became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two small sons. While working as a carpenter, he became a stagehand for the The Doors. He also built a sun deck for actress Sally Kellerman and a recording studio for Brazilian band leader Sérgio Mendes.

What landed him his big break is funny. In 1972 He was hired to build cabinets at George Lucas's home. who subsequently cast him in a pivotal supporting role in the 1973 film, 'American Graffiti'. Lucas and Ford became good friends after that. In 1975, Lucas hired him to read lines for the actors auditioning for the film Star Wars. It wasn't until he had done line readings for a couple months that George Lucas, with the studio's ok, gave him the role of Han Solo.

Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the behest of local authorities. During his assigned duty time assisting the Teton County Search and Rescue he has aided in two mountain rescues. On one of the rescues Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. The hiker boarded Ford's helicopter and proceded to vomited on him unaware of who the pilot was until much later; The hiker is quoted as saying, ""I can't believe I barfed on Harrison Ford!""

I guess she will have to be her own best friend now.Every time I see Harrison Ford, I get the feeling that we are all bothering him.

I would bang that like a screen door in a hurricane.I think I gayed a little...Argh can't believe he is 70..

Great to hear. Thanks for that. :)Credit to Burk Uzzle the photographer. He took a bunch of the iconic Woodstock photos. And if you're in Durham, NC he has a show up right now at the Nasher Museum (but no Woodstock photos there) http://nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions/uzzle/I'm so alone.

EDIT: To make this less of an awful comment, [here's a photo I took when I covered Eaux Claires last year](http://i.imgur.com/YDfpYAw.jpg). I love seeing moments like these...when two people are so intimate and comfortable with each other. I live vicariously through those glimpses of happiness.

EDIT EDIT: Here's [another one from the same festival](http://i.imgur.com/QeFQ612.jpg). I was shooting The National, and during their song 'I Need My Girl' this guy next to me turned around, got down on one knee, and proposed to his girlfriend. This is almost directly after (I let them have their moment obviously, she was sobbing!) and then I asked their permission to take it. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to ask their names, so I'm hoping someday someone recognizes them. I mean look at his face. That is happiness.She was my elementary school nurse and I went to school with both their sons. They are really great people.  They had a cockatoo that was a fucking dick that would attack people though. 

Edit: bad grammar

Edit 2 : I hate these posts,  these are two really great people that have had successful careers and raised 2 great guy's.  Dude's high as a kiteThat's adorableSuper nice people who raised one of the nicest kids I ever taught.  Thanks for the update!""Ha ha! We can't remember any of that concert!""

""We were so stoned!""

EDIT: Wow, Gold. Would have thought that this late comment would get burried. Thanks for popping my cherry. First gold.One of my friends studied in China with a bunch of people from North Korea. He said that they were amazed by the plethora of stuff you could buy in a grocery store. If you had been caught taking photos illegally, what kind of punishment would be typical?

I'd expect your camera would be confiscated or you'd be forced to delete the photos, but was there any threat of being detained or anything?Looking at your full photo series, these are some amazing candid photos of life in North Korea that I have never seen anywhere else.  The one thing that struck me was that any picture that wasn't in a city had food growing in it, and the hills were almost denuded of trees.In North Korea, there are places you can visit and places you cannot visit, and the latter are far more numerous. Well, this is one of them. Usually, we were accompanied by our guides, one in the front, one in the back. But at one point they were both in the front, which allowed for a literally 15-second long detour into this ordinary shop for North Koreans. That gave me maybe 10 seconds to take this picture, before being kicked out by the ""bad cop"" guide, and the atmosphere became rather unpleasant. I'm not sure if he saw me taking these pictures.

Also, I've got a photo album with the photos of my journey into North Korea, if anyone is interested.Nicely done!  Would love to see more of those ""staged"" North Korean areas to see the parity.My Chinese girlfriend has been to North Korea and had these pics to share.

Something always bothered me in all the pics of the last two Kims surrounded by their generals looking and pointing at things that I couldn't put my finger on...then one day I realized the flash of the camera was the light. Otherwise they were in very dim lit rooms. I want to say first that this kind of quality contribution to Reddit is why I love being on this website.  This is an example of a stellar piece of original content that is both interesting and informative.  I also appreciate the fact that /u/M1ckey took time out to answer other people's questions about his trip.

Thanks for taking the time out to post this to Reddit.  With all that said, I have a couple questions for you.  :)

First, did you ever have any experiences where you felt somewhat anxious or unnerved (guards acting threatening, eyeing you up, etc.)

Second, were there any Americans with your group?  I'm curious if they would allow Americans at all (I know they did in the past, but obviously they can change that at any time).  

Thanks again.  Love your pictures.  This is actually worthy of a publication like National Geographic picking up on this or maybe a story in the NYT.  Very cool.Staggering, beautiful, eerie and quite sad. Do you want to be thrown in a gulag? Because this is how you get thrown in a gulag. Why does North Korea allow people in to visit?Kimmy is not happy you took this, op.

Also, thanks very much for posting these.  Keep 'em coming.Can I get a price check on the veggies there on the counter?The guides were probably killed after this and you just started the new Korean war all because of a photo jkThank you for posting these! Great pictures and commentary to go with them. It is amazing to see inside the country, even though most of what you see is depressing. I thought all the produce in North Korea was fake..> Pro tip: You can override the firmware on your camera, so that the Delete button doesn't really delete the photos

Clever. Don't push your luck too much though, these guys are ruthless (unless you're willing to face the consequences). It's really sad that people have to suffer because one idiot was born with such powers to control the country and no one can change it.. At least for now..

http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/

Their most famous member is John Dobson, who apparently just died. He invented/popularized the telescope design that the OP's photo shows - it's called a ""Dobsonian"" mount.

There's a documentary about him called A Sidewalk Astronomer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sidewalk_AstronomerSo did you take a look at jupiter?We need more people like this who want to share the amazing parts of the world, just for the satisfaction of opening eyes to new things.Holy shit I would jump all over that.

Where was this?On our honeymoon to Hawaii, my wife and I went to a roof top observatory at our hotel.  There were about 10 other couples for that viewing and not one of them ever stopped talking and half the people didn't look through the fucking telescope.  Here was this super enthusiastic guide with a very expensive telescope and a super dark sky, trying to talk and these fuckers were completely ignoring him while having their own conversations (loudly).  It was $25 a person and absolutely awesome.  To this day I have no idea what the fuck those assholes were up there for.  Really Cool, not at all sad. lots of people have never looked through a telescope, ever. It's really something!!Some people just want to watch the world learn!Except he is blind, and the telescope is pointed at the sun.A couple years ago while camping my kids (12 and 10 at the time) and I set up our good set of binoculars on the tripod to look at Jupiter. While wasn't much more than a bright dot you could also see four of the moons quite clearly.

As we were looking a girl in her early 20's walked by and asked what we were doing. My oldest (a budding astronomer) explained in detail about the planet, the moons, distances etc. Pretty soon we had a line of people wanting to look with my junior astronomer giving lessons. 

People are hungry for this kind of thing. All it takes is giving them an opportunity. 

And my kid learned when to just shut up and nod when some drunk guy started in about some conspiracy about satellites instead of trying to correct him.the old shoe-polish-on-the-lookie-hole gag... *classic*I took this iPhone photo of Saturn through a telescope like that.

He sets up like 3 or 4 scopes for anyone that wants to look. One of them is a big Meade LX series. I think it's the 8 inch. That's a big heavy thing to lug around and set up and he does it like 3 nights a week. He's a real cool dude.This man and his telescope alone could inspire a child to pursue science and astronomy and that would be beautiful. My former neighbor (an astrophysicist) used drop fliers all around the neighborhood inviting people to come join him for skywatching out in front of his house. He'd set up his telescope and enthusiastically talk about the things we were looking at. Unfortunately no one other than my family ever bothered to show up. They didn't know what they were missing!In the tradition of John Dobson.. some good old sidewalk astronomy! :)I think that's awesome that he is so excited about it that he wants to share it with everybody.  Far worse ways to spend your retirement, like feeding coins into a one-armed-bandit.I miss my grandpa. :( This same fellow showed me Saturn outside a dark bar in New York City 20 years ago.  It changed my life forever.A good buddy of mine got his PhD in Astrophysics . . . while he was in his program, he was very involved in outreach.  He sometimes set up telescopes on the streets of Harlem, and told me about a mother who cried when seeing the reaction of her kid as he looked through the telescope. That's damn cool, and perhaps THE most expensive telescope you will ever see in your entire life. That model of telescope costs thousands of dollars.

The only more powerful ""commercial"" scopes available are the types that are ""fold-out"" (look em up - basically what OP posted but with additional tubing/magnification). You will typically ONLY find these the fold-out type available to the public during public dark site meetings. 

Usually the only people who get to use such high powered equipment are those who own them, those who are in the field, and students at universities that attend classes which go to dark sites (AND, those who attend PUBLIC dark-site meetings, which very few know about).

I had the great joy in my life of taking an astronomy class (a great interest of mine, but no where near my degree) in which, for a grade, we had to attend a dark site twice. It was AMAZING. I actually got to see Saturn AND it's rings through one of these ultra powerful type telescopes. I was even able to snap of a picture through the eye port with an old film camera of the rings and when developed you could still make out the rings. 

I strongly recommend you look up local 'dark sites', which is where you will find FREE use of sweet shit like this.

I just hope this comment gets a few views, instead of all the bullshit comments that are at the top.I would of spent as much time as he was willing to give, talking to him. A lot of people see older folks as a nuisance but I love learning and interesting talk so I often talk to older folks. Especially ones with awesome telescopes who probably share the same great interest in space like I do.The man who invented that type of telescope mount, John Dobson, used to do that exact thing.  He'd setup a telescope in public for anyone to look through.  He died this year.I set mine up at the local park during the last eclipse and during the transit of Venus. :)I was reading a post yesterday about awful it is when older people act more arrogant, greedy, and just generally more unpleasant as they age. The consensus was that a lot of these elderly folks simply reach a point where they say ""fuck it,"" and just don't give a shit anymore, which often leads down a negative route of insensitivity and apathy.

This fuckin' boss of an old man, however, has taken the ""fuck it"" attitude and harnessed something truly amazing. He's decided, ""fuck it, am going to take my telescope-in-a-red-suitcase-with-wheels, set up shop in a parking lot, and *give* something to people. A different planet every day. No, every hour. Fuck it, doesn't matter, because I'm the fuckin' guy in charge, and I'm the one who decides which planet my fuckin' interchangeable sign will display.""

It's a closer look at the universe, a glimpse into the past, and a bit of magic all rolled into one.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512512My parents own a restaurant near a state college here in California. Next to us is a Massage parlor owned by a middle aged Chinese woman. I always get people asking me if it's a shady place next door, and if the women there are pretty. I don't want to interfere with their business, so I just say I don't know. About the pretty girls, anyway, I didn't know if they did shady stuff. But the owner does get food from us often, so we have an okay relationship with her.

My mom and the Massage parlor owner were talking about their lease terms a few weeks ago and they were both complaining that business was bad and that we're all looking to sell our businesses and move elsewhere. My mom said bad business was partly due to being close to the college. The lady rants up with ""I know! And college kids they're the worst! They never tip! And they always ask for handjob, I say no handjob!!!"" It made me laugh but I guess now I know where she is with that business.

You wait a while and you see progress here and there. More discoveries are made about the nature of our universe. Machinery is sent to distant masses to search for signs of life. But there isn't any progress like what you imagined the first moment that your foot imprinted upon that fine lunar soil. 

You're aging now. You're getting older and that progress still hasn't been made. You wonder what landing on the moon really accomplished if it wasn't a stepping stone for even greater things, but then you hear whisperings of plans to colonize Mars.

*This* is why you need to be careful when buying a car not to buy a ""salvage"" title. Cars like this are bought from the owners by the insurance companies, and then some are resold at auction by increasingly unscrupulous people as the car goes down the chain. Soon it appears at a fly-by-night car lot, looking all spiffy... but if you check the title history (via carfax or similar) you'll find the ""flood salvage"" on there.

Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we say, love. 

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye, and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot has appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" 

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. 

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. 

Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear-Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. 

Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 

He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.

Those are sequences of sandstone, shale, and some limestone.  Shales are only deposited in deep oceans while sandstones are deposited near shore.  Limestones are deposited only in shallow marine waters.  You may ask, then why does the sequel switch or repeat? Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so ""floats"" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions.Almost 6,000 years of geological history right there!

It was a tough choice, tossing out a long accepted book's history for some painfully obvious hard data.

And an interesting bit form an interview he gave in December:

> ""You know what? I used to say, every day, 'I am so sick and tired of shaving.' I had to shave every day, every day, for 33 years,"" he explained. ""And even before that when I was working on local TV. And I just thought, the first thing I will do when I am not on TV is stop shaving. And everybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it,"" he explains. ""But it's interesting. I've kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I'm sort of enjoying. I can tell that people are off-put by it. And the more people implore me to shave, the stronger my resolve is to not shave.""

Edit: Holy turds, I've got some reading to do. Figured a comment about Muncie on reddit would get buried af. Even though I haven't lived there since 1982, Muncie still holds a special place in my heart. I spent summers with my grandparents there growing up. Now I have to get nostalgic for a minute. Lots of fond memories of Pizza King (I'd kill for a Royal Feast right now), the Baskin Robbins and the movie theater it was attached to, cinnamon raisins biscuits from Hardee's, swimming and learning to play golf at the Delaware, trips to Upland to go to Ivanhoe's, Aladdin's Castle at the mall and beef manhattan's from the MCL, the urine stenched slide at Mitchell elementary, watching the cooks make the pizza at Noble Roman's, the children's museum, I'll^just^stahp^here^onions.

Edit #2: Just thought of a story about the first and last time my sister got to see the house my mom grew up in. My parents moved the family to Texas before my sister was born. My mother grew up poor and things were tough for her as a child. Growing up, she wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Muncie and leave it in her past forever. My mother, sister and I had to go back to Muncie for a funeral several years ago. While there, my sister wanted to see where my mom was raised and asked me to drive by, though my mother wanted no part of it. Let's just say the house was east of Broadway and south of McGalliard. I warned her that this would probably only happen once, if it was even still standing. I pulled up and parked out in the street, but told my sister we would not be getting out of the car. We sat for all of two minutes before I sped off, my mom in tears and my sister terrified. ""Neighbors"" started coming out of their homes to case us, yell at us and were rapidly approaching the car to do who knows what. It wasn't a fun trip.Since for some reason no one thought to post a picture of what he used to look like, apparantly assuming everyone in the world has seen his show, I give you this image.

It appears closer in the photograph than it does in streetview due to the perspective distortion of the telephoto lens used by the original photographer. However, if you look very closely, you can see many of the same landmarks. You can also see the changes/construction made between 2006 (when this photo was uploaded to [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phuentsholing_Bhutan_Indien.jpg)) and 2013. Keep in mind this is an extremely humid climate.

This photograph just happens to be taken under the face of some construction that caused debris to fall into the as-yet-uncovered sewer. The sewer is now covered with concrete slabs, which now serves as a walkway with fencing and doesn't look that bad.

A further exercise would be to examine the nearby streetview on either side of the border. Then you'll see there is not such a disparity as is attempted to be portrayed whenever this photo is posted.They need to do the needful on the India side there. Couple things I noticed, learned, and saw when in India for business. I was in a city, so I can't speak for the rest of the country nor can I speak about rural areas. I did not live there, I only did work and left. And before anybody thinks I'm disrespecting India, I loved my trip and I'd go back.

1) Trash was thrown on street sides. Often people gathered it up and tossed it in large piles in more centralized areas. People rummage through the trash looking for food. Then animals do the same. Whatever is left either stays there or is taken by the poorest of the poor. During the rainy season, this trash often ends up in drainage systems which end up clogged so the streets flood. Then someone is sent in to clean the drains and that person often removes lots of trash and puts it back into the large pile. The cycle continues. While I was there for just under two weeks, three people died cleaning drains.

2) The most wealthy parts of the city look like most ""first world"" cities. They have very new high rise buildings which are well maintained, cleaned, and they employ lots of people doing lots of small jobs. When you have so many people to employ, things that are taken for granted in other places become a job for someone.

3) Everybody knows someone that can be paid to get something done. Here in the US you need licensed contractors to build buildings and you need licensed electricians and plumbers. You need to have a contractor or your utility company come hook up power, phone, sewer, etc. I experienced more pay-offs in my short time in India than I can even believe. Right down to my driver paying off the guards at my hotel to just let us through instead of stopping us every day for bomb checks. While this social system employs lots of people that take a small cut at every level, it's obviously rife with abuse.

4) The resources required to run a single unified nation with over a billion people in it is unfathomable. And since India is what many would consider a developing country, those resources are scarce and badly needed. Imagine trying to provide medical care for a BILLION people, many of whom make the equivalent of a few US dollars a year. Imagine the public works project that would be required to collect, sort, recycle, and properly dispose of trash for a city that has 20-20k people per square kilometer! Just the amount of trash produced is staggering and now you have to pay people to collect it and properly handle it?!


Again, I loved my trip to India and I'd go again in an instant. It really taught me a lot about the world and how I looked at it through the lens of my own daily experience. I saw human beings eating plastic bags for food. I also saw the Taj hotel. I saw things that made me uncomfortable like the tourist traps set up around the Mumbai terror attacks, and I saw beautiful city streets with big box stores and the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen. I think that extreme contrast changed me a bit for the better, but I can say that not every part of India looks like this, but I suspect a lot of the areas not chock full of rich people do.[deleted][California | Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Border_Mexico_USA.jpg)I wish we can see more left side tho but thats quite disturbingLooks like my gfs side of the bed vs mine.

[deleted]Late to this and is probably going to be buried, but I have lived in Bhutan for approximately 3 years (2002, 2003, various summers) because my father was posted there (Indian Army has many projects in Bhutan). The Bhutanese are very clean, neat and organized people. They are warm and welcoming, but this is the border with West Bengal (Which is a shitty Indian state that other Indians hate too). While a lot of India is dirty, this specific state is known to be the absolute fucking worst. Also what you're looking at is just one aspect.

In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options. Often you're immediately emasculated. Females look at you as a man doing a historically woman's job which makes them wonder why you're there to begin with. Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience. Now working as a traveller and agency RN, i sometimes work in multiple hospitals a week with all new faces and people to get to know which makes you all the more intriguing to the staffers if you don't suck. I am a female RN but my youngest brother is an LPN. He says his nursing school experience was just terrible and working with 99.9% women is less than ideal for him.I'm a male and I've been an RN for about 7 months now.  Out of taking care of hundreds of patients.. only one has had a problem with a male taking care of them.  All the others had nothing but positive things to say about males being in nursing.  When I starting nursing school I used to be afraid to tell people my major due to the negative stigma.  That stigma does not exist and I am now proud to tell people I am a nurse.  Patients, doctors, and other nurses all treat me with the utmost respect.  I am not a male nurse.

This is in Ladakh in northwest India, and is in the outer Himalayan ranges. Ladakh was part of historical Tibet, and so the culture up there (while uniquely Ladakhi) is more Tibetan than Indian. It is also a part of Kashmir, though (or really, abuts it), so it's a mix of cultures. I think the average altitude of Ladakh is somewhere around 14,000 feet.Looks a bit like a Metal Gear Solid V village :D

It would take you almost 8,900 years to drive there at 60 mph.

And in terms of our galaxy, that is microscopically miniscule.  Our universe is REALLY big.How far we have come. From bashing each other on the head with a stick to gather food to exploration of our solar system. I sincerely hope we're entering a golden age of progress and understanding. It feels like Pluto is taking a bunch of extreme selfies of itself all made up and doing unexpected things in an attempt to make its ex ND Tyson super jealousGreat post of picture...and not to wax too scientific in /r/pics, but this isn't really a ""sunset"", because Pluto basically rolls along its orbit with the axis tilted on its side (120° specifically) with regard to the plane of its orbit.  This means the ""north"" end of Pluto is constantly rotisserieing in sunlight, and the ""south"" end away from the Sun is in constant darkness.

So think of these as the mountains lining the way into Modor, constantly in twilight.Interesting to note the lack of crater activity. what are those layers in the atmosphere, and what's causing these mountain ranges to crop up? why does pluto have mountains but, say, the moon doesn't?for scale:

http://imgur.com/20TwnclThose mountain ranges look massive Question for any science-savy person: 

What are the causes of such enormous mountains? Plate techtonics? Impacts? I would love to know how tall those mountains are.Absolutely amazing. Less money spent on war and more spent on giving NASA it's budget back.  Now we need a new edit for one of my favorite wallpapers https://i.imgur.com/p5fLTnB.jpgMeh.  You should see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion.  Now that's something.The title of this picture in /r/space is simply “Close-up of sunset on Pluto”.

It really shows how sensationalist /r/pics has become.If that doesn't convince the Flat-Plutoists nothing will.Do we have any idea how tall those mountains are? How do they take such wonderful pictures with so little light? How big are these mountains? Ballpark it or something i just need an answer.Earth is prettier...I officially call Dibs on Pluto.

Not that I don't agree with the sentiment expressed here, but it is true that the petrochemical industry is one of the largest sectors of our (Louisiana's) economy, so any big museum, park, etc. will usually have large donations from those companies.That's some slick marketing skills. The Whitest Kids U' Know said it best:

United Petroleum Rep: ""You know they say that Oil and water don't mix""

United Petroleum Scientist: ""But dammit if we're not trying""

Reminds me of the [insectarium](http://imgur.com/5NqIXkg) at the St. Louis Zoo.[Google's street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.9507235,-90.0632551,3a,37.5y,87.62h,71.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swAEkZd2KUbI-LF6AgfavxA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)By far my favorite moment from visiting the New Orleans aquarium was pranking a little kid.

There was a concave viewing window in the big tank, but head on, you could tell.  There was a little girl sitting head-on but a bit far away.  It seemed she didn't notice that she could poke her head into the concavity to look around.

I went up to the window and said, ""Hey, watch this,"" and placed my hand, mime-style, on where she seemed to think the glass was.  And then *pushed.*

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""  And she ran off.

I later saw her frantically pointing at me to who I assumed was her mom as I was leaving.I love how that whole take is supposed to show how those oil rigs provide a great undersea ecosystem.  Fish love Big Oil!They gave us the aquarium so that we dont have to worry about the real ocean anymore. It's also of note that the tank's design and layout are intended to simulate the bottom of an oil rig, so their sponsorship (while certainly eyebrow-raising) DOES sort of make sense.

As a New Orleanian, I know they have the money. I don't like it, but I know it. And I'd rather the kids see it, while the adults roll their eyes at the irony.I thought the same thing when I went there for the first time. 

I always imagined that one day they would put on a kids presentation, showing that there is no way that oil can harm sea life, because water and oil separates. There for, the fist are fine. Or some other BS like that. I was working offshore on a Shell platform when they accidentally pumped 80bbls of Biocide into the Gulf.... ""Oops! My bad...."" 
Reported? = Nope""We're sorry...""The lone survivors.Look at all the fish we kill!they spelled ""destroyed"" wrong I fucking HATED this when I went to NOLA Aquarium.  The entire exhibit is about how the oil rigs provide substrate for coral to grow and create habitat for fish and other marine life.  Yeah I get it that there are fish near oil rigs but not a fucking WORD about the oil spill or cleanup or anything.  Twisted.""Nature - sponsored by corporations"" [deleted]Y'all laugh, but after the oil spill we had a big problem with people marking the BP sign. People would use anything red to cross out that sign: crayons, pencils, markers, sharpies, and most commonly lipstick. After it was all said and done and everything cooled down, AAOA had to buy a new sign. Someone usually stayed by the sign on busier days.

The whole Gulf of Mexico exhibit is geared towards promoting oil companies because to some extent, they actually do help. The right side of the exhibit shows a barren seabed. A few scattered rocks provide minimal cover for small fish, so normally you only see medium to large fish and sharks. On the left side, there's a quarter scale model of an oil rig, which provides hiding spaces for smaller fish which in turn attract even more medium and larger fish. In recent years, reef balls and pipes have been added to show other ways of promoting smaller fish to move in.

Oil rigs, when properly maintained, benefit everyone with perks that are not just about oil. Although making sure you don't spill tons upon tons of oil into the ocean really helps.

Edit: Look, I'm stating this as what they teach their volunteers and how it's presented. This is what they taught me for the years and thousands upon thousands of hours that I worked there and this is the image that AAOA wants to present to the public.

And if you think for one second that I feel that the Horizon disaster was an afterthought, then you have another thing coming. I watched those struggling pelicans with the same sense of hopelessness as I did upon ""the grand pre-open tour"" after Katrina when we basically had nothing alive save for a few animals who could breath air and a couple very stubborn fish. Having gone through nearly a complete aquarium's worth of animals in 2005, if you were there working and if your house had been damaged, you had to develop a very dry sense of humor.

Edit edit: OK, I get it. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was very bad. Y'all act like this didn't effect me, my family, my friends, my workplace, or anything. Please, stop PM'ing me nasty things. Y'all are worse than the lady who thought that penguins were fish and that I couldn't be possibly be right in saying that they were bird and followed me around the rest of the afternoon trying to have a debate to defend her penguin-fish platform.Reminds me of the song Big Yellow Taxi:

*They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum*

*And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them*

*No, no, no*

*Don't it always seem to go*

*That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone*

*They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot*
And that, is, irony!If only we could fit the entire gulf in a tank, just think about all the extra oil we could drill out there in the new desert.Remember when it was sponsored by itself and doing just fine?","[0.934911, 0.192616, 0.318165, 0.053192, 0.050344, 0.049, 0.0, 0.69, 0.265, 0.089, 0.613, 0.595, 0.818]"

Really fucking weird movie. Lonely dude pays random actors to pretend to be his family for his birthday. I recommend a watch, if you're fluent in Spanish.Hardly a new idea. Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did something similar on his famous painting 'Las Meninas', in the 17th Century.

The painting depicts the Royal Spanish infanta Margarita Teresa with her maids and other aids, taken from the point of view of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana who are at the same time posing for a portrait that Velázquez himself is depicted painting (left side).

The only clue we have about who is Velázquez painting in this scene is a mirror hanging at the back of the room, where the reflection of the king and queen can be seen.

Ohio post offfice refused to deliver it because of the smell and made the addressee come pick it up. dead armadillo received. 

a few weeks later my friend, the guy who shipped the dead armadillo, got very ill and was in the hospital for a couple weeks with some kind of stomach infection that descended further into his digestive tract. he had to have part of his intestines removed and was touch and go for a bit in the hospital. Negative comments aside, that is pretty darn cute. Look how happy that kid is with that thing.

Who wants a tutorial?

Edit: I'll make a tutorial tomorrow, sorry but it's not a straight forward filter like you're hoping (I was too!). Some people have asked if you just fold the image, that's certainly possible but as you've all seen it creates major artefacts, due to the warping. It's a great place to start though as it helps to establish what you should be aiming for. Those of you familiar with Photoshop this technique is essentially a matte painting especially with more complicated images. 

Basically you don't bend the image, you duplicate, rotate as necessary and then mask the connecting line with any techniques you can. Such as using the clone tool or selecting objects and spreading them across the connecting line to conceal the stitch. Oceans and beaches work well because our eyes are expecting to see repeated patterns which can hide the appearance of repeated sections. 

I'm pretty sure you chaps who are familiar with photoshop will get the idea. I think it does look better than the original because of that slant on the left. And the contrast between the land and the sea makes it even better. Amazing job! This one looks better! Good job!I thought this image looked familiar. I've used it before in my work

They have a height of 110 metres (360 ft) and 76 metres (249 ft) and will host more than 900 trees (approximately 550 and 350 trees in the first and second towers respectively) on 8,900 square metres (96,000 sq ft) of terraces.

Was just there a few days ago. Beautiful. But. .... what about roots? I like it!Fantastic!Super cool shot, thanks for sharing.  I really like how unique the vertical view is in terms of re-framing our relationship to trees.  Seeing the forest 'deconstructed' in a way, one apartment = one tree, really drives home how connected we really are, when cities tend to obscure this aspect by removing trees, turning that relationship from direct to abstract by completely separating the cityspace from the naturespace.  And you know it's far more than one tree per person to supply your oxygen.How can I get this in Cities Skylines?

The [Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome) is the first domed stadium, and has been sitting unused for about a decade. 

I personally think this is a great idea. Houston is a huge metro area (4th most populous in the country) but lacks a world-class amusement or water park since Six Flags closed. And the summers here can be unbearable, so going indoors is a great idea. Now who's paying for it? That'll be an issue of course.This is not an *old* airship hangar. The building was finished in November 2001. It belonged to a company called CargoLifter that wanted to build freight airships but went bankrupt before any airship was built. They basically only built the hangar and a few hot air balloons for testing.  
  
After that the hangar was re purposed as this waterpark.

[Edit: Looks like it](https://vimeo.com/61845373)This hangar was actually built in 1998, and has nothing to do with the nazis or hindenburg. it was built for an airship project called Cargolifter, which would have been used to transport extremely heavy things into and out of berlin. Before they built the zeppelin they noticed that this could not work, because as soon as the cargo would have been released, the airships high bouyancy ( to lift the several-ton Cargo) would have catapulted the ship up. But the hangar was built anyway. I cannot recommend the park in it, its horrible because there is no sky, and very non-tropical lightingThat middle part could be turned into lazy river. Not really old. It was built in 2000.

Then my parents took us to the local grade school to get our polio vaccine, it was squirted onto a sugar cube. The whole town turned out. I remember the long lines of people. My memory is that we did this twice, perhaps? 

And my smallpox vaccination, still have the scar from that. [Vaccines made the iron butt obsolete.](http://i.makeagif.com/media/10-28-2014/ZLHQK1.gif)Remember when you got polio?

My great-aunt got polio when she was pregnant with her second of four children. She was a bad-ass but she was never able to move around again with a wheelchair or her ""sticks."" 

Her older sister, another great-aunt, died of diphtheria at age six.

This is only a stone's throw away in history. VACCINATE.

P.S. If you want to learn more about what life was like for polio survivors, there's a wonderful memoir by Peg Kehret called Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio. I read it aloud to my son and we both thought it was terrifically interesting.# #BringBackIronLungYou're killing your father, Larry!Am I the only one that wants to turn that in to a bed, like a cocoon bed with wrap around memory foam with cooling gel beads.  Actually modern ventilators and endotracheal intubation made this obsolete because we still need to ventilate people. Still get vaccinated though. Makes me think of radiohead. I work in public health and I still can't believe this is an issue. Parents come in explaining how they aren't gonna put that ""poison"" in their kids. That they're going to just boost the immune system through diet.

One thing to note about this photographer is that he actually dressed up to go to the wedding.

Having been to quite a few weddings now, a shocking amount of photographers turn up dressed like it's a hacky sack tournament on the college lawn. Dear all men (and/or women): take everything out of your suit pockets before the photo session. I am sorry I am not staring at you, I am taking your picture.My best friend is a wedding photographer/videographer, and it's honestly amazing the more I watch how much angles, lens, filter can change a shot. My sisters wedding was outdoors, and it happened to be overcast when it was supposed to be sunny and an unprecedented rain actually moved in later in the evening (damn TX weather), but you couldn't even tell in any of the shots. He made sure all pictures were taken from angles where the little bit of sun was in the background, made amazing use of the natural lighting, and always panned the video to pick up the most natural light etc. It looked so good and made my sister so happy. That guy has a great eye for photography. He's going places!For a split second I thought he was dead and I thought of Rick and Morty :(

https://www.flickr.com/photos/caseyrbrown[deleted][deleted]^^^^Some ^^^^assembly ^^^^requiredHave to wonder if there is a bunch of these sitting in the corner of some Army base warehouse because of long forgotten clerical error. I had a teacher back in high school who was in the Vietnam war.  His job was to blow up bridges so the VC couldn't follow them or use the bridges to resupply.   Well, this meant he pretty much spent most of his time hanging around ""bases"" which were no more than commandeered villages.  One day, he takes bricks that were just sitting around and made a gigantic barbecue pit.  A villager had given him a pig for some reason or another, so he decided to throw a gigantic party for everyone stationed in that village, as well as any villagers that wanted to come.  Not surprisingly, he got into huge trouble, and was removed from the village and stationed in the worst, most degrading job there was.  They made him guard a junk yard in the middle of the jungle.  It was mostly jeeps exactly like this one.

Well, as you can see from the picture, these Jeeps mostly just bolt together. So 12 hours a day with nothing to do, his boredom got the best of him, so he started bolting these pieces together from various junked Jeeps to see if he could make a functioning Jeep.   He said he got about 90% there. The only thing he couldn't do with the parts he had was functioning brakes.  So he did the best he could, he bolted a gigantic pole to the side of the jeep that he could shove into the tire and pull as hard as he could to slow the jeep down.

He ended up driving the jeep around that little area for his remaining time in Vietnam, sometimes even driving around officers and other dignitaries, no one even questioned whether he was supposed to have a Jeep or why he had to use a gigantic pole to stop.The ultimate example of ""its worth more in the box"". http://imgur.com/a/5ZgEX

Army vet here, I was stationed in South Korea back in the early 80's. I worked at the base HQ but was all enlisted were required to pull motor pool duty one week a month. I reported ""as ordered"" to the Motor pool non-com and was assigned the duty of tearing down and repacking two Korean War era jeeps. They looked very much like the picture. They crates had a jeep size fold-out cloth with actual sized spots for each individual parts with pictographs of where to find the part on a jeep and how to remove them. The entire process could be done without reading any words. It took me ten days to complete the job. It was a most satisfying task.
Fragiiiillllle.Does it include an allen wrench or what?Are these the ""jeep kits"" that where offered for sale for $450.00 in the back of old magazines? First thing I thought ""Some assembly required"" I kinda wish that I could get a modern car shipped to me like this.  It would be fun to have to put it together before you use it.  Like the adult version of Legos!

**Edit:** I completely forgot about kit cars!  So I guess this still is a thing.They did this with larger vehicles too, I have a M35A2 and they were designed to ship in crates as well.  The tops disassemble with simple tools, windshield folds town and the highest point on the vehicle is the top of the steering wheel.I believe they were a lot more effective after they replaced the square wooden wheels with round rubber onesJ.ust

I actually stayed there two years ago. There is a small hotel on the island (on the side closest to land, next to the bridge). 

Here are some pictures of the hotel : [Image 1](https://d1p98clqffzjxh.cloudfront.net/lazareto/L13405.jpg). [Image 2](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cc/0f/c7/tower-and-stone-cottage.jpg).

I ran up to the top of the island every day of our stay. There's a church up there, and a couple of lookouts, one of which can be seen in OP's picture (top of the island, closest to land).

What hasn't been mentioned here is that the island and town is pretty much uninhabited - a lot of the building have been restored for historical purposes.

Currently much of the town is closed off to the public - buildings and areas that are open have been converted to tourist shops, bars and hotels. It's a pretty cool place. Perhaps when the restorations are fully complete there will be room for more people to stay in the town.

Without a doubt, my favourite part of Monemvasia is the little enclosed ""pool"" on the side. I couldn't find any great pictures, but here is a [pretty decent one](http://www.mediterranean-cruise-advice.com/images/IMG_0082.jpg), showing the little enclosed natural pool, which curves around and continues beyond the picture. I really enjoyed staying there.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that [in this conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2tupdd/the_hidden_town_of_monemvasia_greece/co2i6zr?context=10000), /u/woohalladoobop points out that the building OP is talking about is a city-owned home for the mayor to live in, and claims that he lived there. I'm calling out his bullshit.

The full comment, as it has since been deleted:
> I actually come from Monemvasia. That house is owned by the city for the mayor to live in. Fun fact: Mayor Spiros Anagna was thrown out of a window over the cliff by some townsfolk in the 1920's after he was caught having an affair with an underage girl who worked at the house.

The house isn't a house, it's a church, named Agia Sofia (pronounced ayia sofia). [Here is a picture](https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/38470106.jpg) of some tourists next to it (not my picture).

* The stairs that lead you underneath and outside the town walls, to a platform facing the open sea (The Myrtoon Pelagos (pronounced ""Mir-to-on""). People could dive in, the waters are amazing, and there are some steps to help you back up. In the summer, children would joyfully sit on the platform and let the waves wash over them. 
* The view from the center of the town square facing up towards the rock and the steps leading to the top is beautiful, brings to mind something out of a fairytale.
* There are some great coctail bars up there (it helps that I spent my summer there with great friends as well)!

**EDIT: cannot format....This town has an awesome history. For the Crusade buffs out there, when Constantinople was displaced from the Byzantine Empire after the 4th Crusade, many various Crusader kingdoms were carved out from Greece. Monemvasia held out though for the longest time as a pirate town/raiding point and proved to be a headache for the occupying Crusader kingdoms. Even when the entire Peloponnesus was under Crusader control, this one seaside enclave held out. Its amazing.**[Spanakopita!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wgR_4TwHOQ)**

My dad is in no mood to get into some street race with a bunch of yahoos or whatever they want. He ignores them and continues on, but they follow him, honking at him, meet at the next light, ""Yo man! Heyyy!""

Finally he's like ""WHAT?!"" 

""Hey man, you got a cat on your car, man!""

Poor kitty was clinging on for dear life and of course as soon as he pulled into the nearest parking lot, it shot off into the bushes to kiss solid ground. 

The lowrider followed my dad into the lot and all five young guys piled out and spent the next 10 minutes shaking bushes, crawling around, making kissy noises, and helped my dad catch the cat. Once they caught the cat they told it: ""no more car surfing, man!"" I like to think he's making [this](https://i.imgur.com/4XiFgJp.gifv) face as he clings on. [deleted]I'm actually know these people, it was on Facebook a couple of days ago. They drove about ten miles with the cat on the hay, and then another driver got their attention.

He continued running across campus and everyone who had been staking me out ran after him.  
&nbsp;  
I waited two minutes and then walked quietly back to my dorm.I was in a dorm where there was a girl who looked just like me, dressed like me, and even had the same major. 

She even walked and talked like me. It was rather unreal. Our names sounded similar, just one letter off, so people would call out to her and I'd respond, and vice versa.

My mother was visiting me once and I went to take a shower. At around the same time, my doppelganger got done with hers and began walking to her room. My mother saw what she thought was me going somewhere not my room and called out to me and she answered. I came out to see both of them talking and my first reaction was 'mom, that's not me!'

We've stayed in touch and she's now a researcher in the same area as I am. When I was quitting my earlier job, I referred her to that team and she got hired. My old colleagues say it's like I never left.

Edit: I saw her parents at graduation. They look nothing like mine, though the resemblance to her is clear. I'm also the spitting image of my mom except for my father's jawline, so I'm not adopted either. That made it genuinely cool for me.I read ""10 years ago I went off to college"" and thought, man, you must be old.

Then I realized that I started college 11 years ago. 

:lI am a neuroscientist. In biology/medicine, we use [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to find articles, and authors are listed as ""LastName, FirstInitial SecondInitial"". I'm listed as Thompson CK. And since Thompson is such a common name, I'm not the only Thompson CK. In fact, there is another Thompson CK publishing in neuroscience, and occasionally I get emails for him, because his name is Christopher K Thompson, my exact name. 

Every year, there is one big neuroscience conference with 35,000+ attendees, and last year I emailed him to see if we can meet up. He comes to my poster, and I am just shocked at how similar her looks to me! I have two brothers, and he looks a lot more like me than either of them! Even more, he also happened to grow up in a town about 8 miles from my hometown. We both have degrees from the University of Illinois. We both really like pizza and beer. I mean, what are the chances...

Here is a [pic.](http://i.imgur.com/yoLulp0.jpg) I'm on the left. Funny enough, I had shaved my beard about 3 months prior to this pic being taken. If I'd left it on, we'd almost be twins.

And I never forget faces. Eventually I was like ""No, I never met you!""

And the response was ""Yeah, we met earlier, you are Sean from Baltimore"". And I was from Baltimore.

Turns out, there was another Sean from Baltimore staying at the hostel and meeting loads of people. 

Yeah, and he looked *exactly* like me. When we ran into each other in the hallway I instantly knew this was the dude. He looked at me the exact same way since he had been dealing with the same issue since we were both very outgoing people.

We talked for about 3 seconds and then both ran in different directions. I guess we were both freaked the fuck out that we were both Sean from Baltimore, short hair, same facial structure, same clothing style, same height, same build, same social personality...

Hopefully all these new links hold after DropBox crapped out.Wiki on the Greater Tokyo area http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area 

More people live here than the countries of Canada and Iraq [Reminds me of this picture of Mexico City](http://i.imgur.com/FPO3S59.jpg)I visited Tokyo once, and one thing that stuck with me was how I've read a lot of science fiction that I thought was original, but no, it's just describing Tokyo.  Pretty much everything that's written about a giant city-like planet is really Tokyo inspired.

It definitely made me think about how there are surely some people who have never left that city in their lives, and just what you imagine the rest of the world to be like if you're one of those people.No wonder it's taken Godzilla so long to destroy it.It kind of looks like a sci-fi concept of a planet-wide city.For perspective, [this is the greater Tokyo area superimposed onto the United Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/Eqfme.jpg)See that EA? This is what Sim City should be about. Let me build (or at least plan and manage) THIS. 

What's so hard about it?  I just essentially need Sim City 3000 on today's hardware. No real 3D is even needed.I live in Tokyo... this is just one direction... If you go to to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building, Mori tower, or Tokyo Sky Tree on a clear day, you just see... cement as far as the eye can see. You'll see Kawasaki connect to Yokohama, and then it just fades into the distance. Then you'll see Chiba and Saitama (which we consider the sticks) wall-to-wall with buildings. Then you'll see all the way to Takao-san with nothing but buildings until you get right to the foot of the mountain. It's absolutely insane...

At night it is breathtaking, though.

http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-gigapixel-roppongi-hills-mori-tower/#0.00,0.00,90.0Definitely not as big as Tokyo, but [São Paulo](http://static.theglobalmail.org/cache/37/13/3713345cd59dc2ed9ec915e33f3e5c96.jpg) is also worthy of consideration.Neo-Tokyo is biggerTokyo is literally the population of Canada, in one city. It took me 8 days to drive across CanadaWorst city to survive a zombie apocalypse in.[Google Maps 3D view from roughly the same position](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Tokyo,+Japan/@35.6490331,139.533142,3087a,20y,79.5h,74.73t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x605d1b87f02e57e7:0x2e01618b22571b89?hl=en)

From this it's easy to find the big landmarks. 

Shinjuku is group of skyscrapers on the left side in the middle, which is said to have the busiest subway station in the world. At the right side of the big green park you find Shibuya, you know the shopping district with the [worlds busiest street crossing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2685/4458168800_2727610646_b.jpg),  and the cluster of ""dark"" skyscrapers, guess they are just being shadowed by a cloud, is just beyond the imperial palace and gardens. 



It is in fact the only city large enough for my mother.  When I was visiting Tokyo I thought I would go out to the bar one night. I never thought about the fact that the trains might stop running at some point. So when I came out of the club at 2-3am, I realized I had to walk back to my hotel. Five hours later, after walking in a straight line, I got there. ### it's a **MEGALOPOLIS!** I think I made something like this in SimCity once. The city barely lasted a week. That traffic must be a blast to drive in I like that one green spot. Like that. That is where I shall live!Awesome shot. It always blows my mind when I see non-US cities (as an American). I think Chicago or Charlotte or LA are huge, but they don't hold a candle to the size of some foreign cities. 

EDIT: 

Been getting some responses that seem to be questioning my inclusion of Charlotte. Please note that I included it because not only do I live here and love this city but I figured size-wise it is about the same as a lot of other American cities with the exception of the big three and would make a good reference point when comparing to non-American cities. 

Here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown:

http://i.imgur.com/IEaqYw5.jpgOver 2000 7-11 stores are in Tokyo alone.I'm from New York and everybody here talks about how amazing New York is and how it's the ""greatest city in the world"", but Tokyo easily gets that title in my eyes.  I went to Tokyo a few years back and it was absolutely amazing.  I was in Shinjuku and it was so nice and clean and beautiful.  I've been to NYC numerous times and it was so dirty, the streets were disgusting, tons of homeless people, just total noise pollution from cars hoking etc.  During my stay in Tokyo, over i think it was 4 days, I heard a total of 3 car honks.  3 Car honks in 4 days.  I can hear 3 car honks in 3 seconds in New York City.  So many international cities just outclass NYC, yet apparently NYC is a pride of our country.  Joe Biden's comments about LaGuardia airport a while back is really a microcosm of NYC as a whole, it's dirty, disgusting, and inefficient.  Tokyo's so great because it's like a nicer NYC, but far larger.  Looks like a giant computer motherboard.

I see Mr. Bean.This was the cause of my British moment ever: Today I was held up in traffic due to a bobby on a motorbike who was escorting Mr Bean. I swear I levelled up. Mr. Bean came out in 1990? Weird, I always think of it as being an 80's show. By far the greatest Electrical Engineer to graduate from Oxford. ([not joking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson#Early_life_and_education))Best episode, in my opinion.The first time I ever saw Mr. Bean was when a short episode played in a movie theater before Tim Allen's *The Santa Clause* in 1994. 

It was [the one where he meets the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JizFAhEpiEc), and at that point in all my 11 years, it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.[new whip](http://imgur.com/zfQ3xOx.jpg)I have always loved mr bean. Both my parents are deaf, and would always watch this show. Not only do I love it cos its a super funny show, and Rowan is amazing, but I always loved the fact my parents could watch it and understand everything! 

I wish I could let Rowan and everyone involved know just how important this show is to me.Better put a padlock on my car just to make sure no one steals it.

Teddy This scene is one of my earliest memories in life. I remember staying up late watching tv with my parents when this came on. I was so excited when he was going down that hill losing control of the brake pedal with his broomstick. The second he drove into the madras van, causing the HUGE feather explosion, I had my first case of laughter cramps! I laughed so hard i fell down the from the couch onto our coir rug. Thinking about fact that I fell down due to uncontrollable laughing multiplied the laughing with a factor 10 and made me lose track of time and pain from the fall. My dad had to pick me up to make sure I could breath. I like to believe that this is what shaped me into being the guy I am today, always trying to make people laugh and have fun.
PS. Screw Rupert and Hubert!So who is really controlling the car? That's so Bean... at least he's buckled and using a mop responsibly.Rowan, you beautiful bastard...Mr. Bean was awesome.

Our school carnival had a raffle and there were many prizes. I won the ""grand prize"" which was a GIANT Toblerone bar. It was all one bar, weighed 7kg (a little over 15.5 lbs.) The triangle shaped pieces were at least 2 inches thick and about 5 inches tall. It was the best day ever!  I shared it with all my friends, and my mom made the most awesome chocolate chunk cookies for at least a year off of that thing. It doubles as a cane for when the the diabeetus takes your legs.It's a Cesaro Toblerone. They're both Swiss. Think about it.http://gfycat.com/WaterloggedPiercingFugu

These are, indeed, German turrets, called pillboxes, that were designed to overlook the small town of Saint Malo and defend it against a joint American/British attacks.

Now, if you don't know anything about St Malo, here is a picture to set the mood:

https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&rais=1&oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.letriskel.co.uk%2Fimages%2Frsz_st_malo_june_09_052.jpg&sp=d4f6453f5ef9ca2a9434f0309d0103d2

Now, St Malo is an old medieval city, surrounded by enormous walls. The Germans built a fortress in St Malo proper, along with a series of bunkers in a small hill overlooking the city, the only visible part of which are these gun turrets.

They also built another series of bunkers and AA guns on an island (called Cezembre), which is about 25 minutes away from St Malo, effectively turning the city and its bay into one enormous fortress.

In 1944, shortly after the Normandy Landing, the Allies were faced with a difficult task: either ignore St Malo and risk that the German fortress would attack their rear lines (as it is fairly close to Normandy) or try take the city and suffer heavy losses.

The solution taken was dramatic: the American and the British air forces fire-bombed the city and the Cezembre island for several days, essentially destroying pretty much every building within the city walls, and turning the island bunkers into a pile of rubble. I have seen old German AA guns on that island, and they were warped from the heat.

The final operation saw British ships shelling the German gun turrets from the sea. Pretty much each turret is pockmarket with these shells, and you can actually put your fist in some of these all the way inside the turret itself. The poor bastards inside did not stand a chance.

American ground troops then swept in and the Germans surrendered pretty much without a fight. My family is from there and my father and grand-father used to tell me stories about this battle.

You can look up Saint Malo on Wikipedia, and there are also tons of other sites that talk about the place, which is very beautiful and interesting. The real shame is that the original German bunkers are now closed.

EDIT: well, my first real comment on Reddit, and I got Gold! Thanks!!That particular gun emplacement overlooks the harbour entrance at St-MaloCrazy and saddening to look at that, and think ""Wow, look at those holes! That must have been intense!""

But then to realise I'm 30yrs old, and in all probability it was guys a full decade younger than me sitting in there utterly terrified wanting to go home.

That line between ""well that is certainly interesting"" and ""jesus fuck, this actually happened..."" is a complicated one.Bullet holes make it look like a slightly melted chocolate.Good grief what kind of gun made the holes?

Cause im thinking of this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtopxCjs518

Obviously its not the same quality steel but still.Is that a shell you can see stuck in one of the holes? About a third of the way from the top towards the left side.I went to Normandy 2 years ago while in France for work and two things really struck me:

One, you'd have to be insane to storm that beach. It's wide and deep and it was easy to see the massive advantage the gunners had over the invaders. I knew this based on everything that I have read or seen, but nothing prepares you for seeing it in real life.

Two, while you could still see and even walk into the pill boxes and other fortification that the Germans built, they were starting to be overcome by nature. That was amazing to me. In 50 years those scars will be gone.

*From my mother’s sleep I fell into the State,*

*And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.*

*Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,*

*I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.*

*When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.*This is crazy, I visited France a few years ago and spent a couple days in St. Malo. My friends and I camped on the hill across from the city that had a handful of these pillboxes. I was actually *just* telling my parents last night about how of all the historical landmarks I saw *these* pillboxes were probably the most awe inspiring. All of them were absolutely covered in bullet holes, you could actually find plenty of bullets that had been fused into the metal 70 years ago.

> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).

> The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

How do the waffles taste with home-field advantage?Belgian here. The sugared waffle and strawberry combo you'll be able to find at pretty much every local market. Most will have a waffle stand.

Places to see when visiting:

* Ypres and the entirety of the 'Westhoek' especially nowadays with the 100 year anniversary of WW1. There are plenty of memorial sites here so you might even find a family member. Well preserved remnants of trenches, and some very nice museums.

* While you're in this area the coast isn't too long of a drive. It's a huge tourist trap but if you want try Belgian mussels then you'll find the best on the coast. All sorts of freshly caught fish and seafood can be bought on the dike at around 4-5 pm in the afternoon, when the boats come back in.

* Some of our cities have a very rich history. Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp for example were economical powerhouses in the medieval times and you still get to visit old guild houses and the like. Tongeren on the other hand is the oldest Belgian city and dates back to Roman times. Tongeren has a nice Gallo-Roman museum that sheds light on both cultures living together and merging within Belgian borders.

Local cuisine to try out. Most of it has a very countryside and homely feel to it.

* 'French' fries. Really, these things are Belgian and every town will have at least a few 'frietkoten', places that specialize in only selling French fries and other deep-fried stuff that goes with it. I recommend asking the locals for a good place. It's tough to find a place that sucks but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference in quality.

* Chocolate. If you find a chocolate shop you should definitely go and buy some real Belgian pralines. High price, but worth experiencing.

* Mussels. Best place to order this is obviously the coast, so you're guaranteed they're as fresh as can be. Most often served with fries, a bit of mayonnaise, and a special sauce just for the mussels. The mussels are basically cooked in a stewy vegetable soup with lots of spices. Shrimp are also a very loved local seafood.

* Beef carbonnade, locally known as 'stoofvlees'. I personally dislike it but most Belgians freaking love it. The sauce is often prepared with some heavy beer like a Trappiste or Tripel.

* On that note, the beer. There's a huge variety here. Some people love Jupiler, others the heavier Duvel. We have all sorts of white, blonde, and dark beers as well as fruity 'chick' beers. I'm not much of a beer guy myself but I fucking love a cold Stella Artois. Some places especially in the city will specialize in serving as many different beers as possible and they'll even serve them in the correct glass. Worth asking around if there's such a place where you're visiting. You can drink an afternoon away just exploring tastes if you're not careful.

* Other stuff I can't be bothered to describe anymore: *waterzooi, paling in't groen, pensen, ...*

* My personal favourite: *kiekerenbloed*, literally chicken's blood, which is exactly the main ingredient. It's a *very* local dish that's made by (as far as I know) mixing chicken's blood with bacon grease and baking it, then serving it with a sandwich and a dollop of mustard. [Some gentlemen enjoying a pint and a plate of kiekerenbloed.](http://i.imgur.com/ZO3UeHm.jpg)Fucking Bruges.Someday I'd like to retire to Belgium and live entirely on waffles and fries.

""Yeah...totally""Looks amazing...but this is reddit so let's spoil the party.

It's not functional, piping goes straight up, meaning most of the heat goes up the chimeny. No baffling. Dangerously hot to the touch. No ceramic tiles below it means if you open the doors your house will burn down down. Couches are too close with a fabric throw that will go up in flames. Uneven bottom will mean it will be difficult to start a proper fire. Limited (no) intake control (EDIT: Draft, I had a brainfart on that). If it's a real surplus mine it will burn through pretty quickly, constant heat will ruin the integrity of the metal. A season of maple will destroy it. Good luck opening the hatch with metal handles. Also the fire looks fake.

It's an art piece. Pure design without any function. It's a concept, and one I do really like. Looks really great.

Comment thread in the Dutch subreddit[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2nv3gx/you_will_not_be_arrested_for_using_drugs_in/) Avoid the classic Pulp Fiction situation. As a graphic designer, I love how practically everything in the Netherlands is professionally designed. Isn't it usually possession that's illegal, not the actual consumption?In Australia, at school and university I was always reminded that no matter what the person has ingested, legal or not; it is always safe for them to ring an ambulance. They will only ring the police if there is a dangerous and violent situation.

Paramedics are there to save your life, not to criminally charge you.Little story about some of the victims involved in this.

2 British tourists collapsed on the street after buying and using cocaine that turned out to be white heroin sold as cocaine, both got brought to a hospital. 

After they get some medication one of them decides he feels fine and bails. When the hospital staff realizes he's gone they inform the police who eventually track him down that same night, he was quite easy to spot since the first responders cut open his clothes to get to his chest and he was wearing those clothes. 

He refuses to go back to the hospital, the police have no choice but to detain him and put him in a temporary holding cell where they continuously check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know the exact details on this but he stops breathing/heart stops, the EMT starts CPR. Gets picked up by an ambulance and dies on his way to the hospital.

Meanwhile, at pretty much the exact moment the other guy stops breathing too and survives because he decided to remain in the hospital.

TL;DR: 2 tourists use white heroin thinking it was cocaine, one of them dies after leaving the hospital and the other lives.That's a PSA you will never find in the USA. Where in the world do you get arrested after going to the hospital for an OD?The red-light district in Amsterdam has some pretty dodgy characters. I found the tip is to never stop moving, do not even acknowledge the existence of people trying to sell you things and above all do not show how stoned/drunk you are. What are the three red X's in the upper left corner of the notice? A way of indicating urgency?Which shoulder muscle?Smartest public health sign I have seen in a long time.  Many people will read this because of the ""Cocaine Alert"" and most of those aren't planning on buying cocaine.  But, they will remember it if they see someone with those symptoms and know what to do.  Right on and keep it up!And these huge signs help also

http://imgur.com/l9dmmQ0There's electronic signs all over the busy tourist spots conveying the same message. It's quite comical sometimes how dealers approach you so openly around the common bar areas like Rembrandtplein.Its amazing to see that they actually care and not just let drug users die.Here is a little story from personal experience if you feel like reading something. I currently work in the caregiver field for developmentally disabled adults. Upon starting the job, you find out that the mental illnesses you're dealing with are really just the extreme end of a spectrum that a lot of totally normal people with high IQs are also on. They're really not that different from us besides the fact that for a lot of conditions, their brain cannot resist the urge to do something even when it knows it's wrong. We can know better and learn and resist urges but no matter how many times I teach a client something, when the situation comes back up, the chances of them retaining the knowledge are unfortunately pretty low (but not impossible). With that being said, the following story is about someone with dev. disabilities, but the reactions their brain are having to the events in the story are totally normal and something that we all experience.

You quickly realize that the #1 trick to stopping acts of defiance in your client is to not give them something to defy.

For example we have one girl with oppositional defiance disorder. There is a set time for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, snack in that order. She constantly will cause a scene or have a documented behavior because she wants food at the times that aren't set for food.

Now she is an adult, and she should be allowed to have food any time, but we realized that it wasn't even about eating, it was that she HAD to break the rules. There was something about a rule for her that caused her to want nothing more than to overcome it and break the rule. It has a lot more to do with wanting personal control over your own life, but we call it the forbidden fruit effect.

So we solved her issue by taking away all snack times, dinner times, lunch times, breakfast times, and letting her tell us when she wanted to eat. When she wanted a 3rd or 4th snack we gave it to her. We weighed her after a week and she had gained 10 pounds in literally 1 week.

She was very upset and we explained to her the natural consequences of eating too much. We taught her how to eat healthy and feel healthy. We told her she can still eat whatever whenever she wants.

""No I want to eat healthy, I don't want to be fat.""

From then on she asks for one snack or no snack after dinner. She doesn't go crazy anymore trying to get food at times that she isn't supposed to have it because we totally took away the whole matrix of scheduled times and calories and all that stuff. We took away all of the rules to break and replaced it total freedom coupled with personal accountability.

I really believe a lot of the things people do, especially teenagers, are done 10x more because you're told not to do them. No one wants to be told by another human being with just as many flaws and shortcomings as them that they're not responsible enough to handle their own shit around some food or a drug or whatever else it is that's being forbidden.

**TL;DR A recount from an experience I had working with those with developmental disabilities that relates to the whole idea of the forbidden fruit effect. We took a girl with oppositional defiance disorder who consistently wanted to defy all the house rules and removed every rule and let her control her own life, but showed her the natural results of eating too much or not being responsible. She learned that being in control means it's on her and no one else to make the right choices, and she started making them.**[Gotta love Hamsterdam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHkrZECnfs)at night there is a LOT of coke dealers in the streets of amsterdam, most of them African (as in, actually recently from africa) ","[0.941726, 0.117224, 0.961212, 0.057378, 0.059729, 0.723, 0.0, 0.112, 0.261, 0.079, 0.761, 0.681, 0.795]"

I did not take this photo!! I found it on /r/newsokur. More people needed to see this.

This seems to be the source! but I am not too sure, anyone speak the language? : http://nurullah.net/article/Keske-Hep-Cocuk-Kalabilsek.htmlI know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it.Survey says...""This is not a camera""I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it?Those hats are adorable.I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this ""camera"". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. ""excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?"" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were ""taking pictures of people in their homes"" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police.I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, ""take my picture!  take my picture!""  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a ""hey, come here and look at this..""  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.  That is so fucking cute.I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were ""Are you guys about to widen the road"" and ""Don't take my picture with that"". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.  lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses. I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. ""Oh taking pictures, smile!""

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave. We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, ""It's actually not a camera."" Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, ""Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures."" With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole. I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!  Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks ""how do you ride that thing?"" I replied with ""I clinch my cheeks real tight.""Aw thats adorable!Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background.I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: ""I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera"". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off.I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.

But then again Im super high The reason the lake is clear is because of zebra mussels and other invasive species filtering the water. Its devastating to the eco-system, killing birds and fish. Its cool to see the shipwrecks but its extremely bad for the great lakes.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/vanished.shtmlFour years ago I spent a couple days in the Dolomites at Passo Brocon in northern Italy. I took a long day hike up the mountains above the hotel and found a WW1 gunnery nest. It was mid-September and already pretty damn cool up there. I jumped inside the nest and looked around. The soldiers had a nice view of the area, but they were also totally exposed. The wind whipped over the little hilltop. Then came a sudden thunderstorm. I had nowhere to hide and got completely soaked. As I high-tailed it down the mountain to my hotel, I thought about those soldiers who were stuck in that nest in winter. Holy shit, that would have SUCKED. 

I got hot coffee and drove the 17 miles to town to get new shoes (mine were muddy and filthy). Those soldiers couldn't. They were stuck in the frozen mud for weeks at a time. And now some of them are unearthing. >the remains of two Austrian soldiers found on the Presena Glacier in 2012. Photo: Office for Archaeological Finds, Autonomous Province of Trento

Just dead, nobody knowing for sure whether you died or just never returned, nobody knowing how you died or where you were; and when your body *is* finally discovered, anybody who would've cared is dead now too.It's kind of crazy that when that guy woke up that morning he had no idea he would be killed and begin a 100 year journey through a glacier that would end in 2015 where his picture would be posted across the world for people to look at on their phones, computers, at the bus station, a restaurant, or even sitting on the toilet. I bet he would have stayed in bed had he known that. Captain Italia looks like he needs a little time to readjust They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and terrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Otto von Bismarck had ""ended"" (after a hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army to aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir of Bismarck. And my hunt for Captain America has just made a little bit more progress. Just imagine that was probably some poor woman's husband that she never heard from again...Grim? Check. 
Frost bitten? Check.
Death? Absolutely.

I temp'd at the Boston Beer Company's headquarters in Southie when I lived there for a few years, and this would have been in October of 2014. As the front receptionist, it was my job to sort through those postcards that came from the brewery and make sure nothing vulgar got through. Probably so that the many, many fantastical drawings of penises didn't wind up on places like Reddit and get associated with Sam Adams brand... 

I used to put stickers on dirty messages and still send them through because it made me laugh. Occasionally I even added a note of my own to the postcard if it was really funny. It was a really annoying part of the job because they come in huge bags, but it was also pretty fun because of hilarious messages like this one. 

You'd be surprised how much this occurs. Thanks, dad.

Looking at yahoo finance, their stock price has been below $1 since September, meaning they will be delisted from the NASDAQ soon. Heading for a bankruptcy very soon.  
[Fly you fools](http://i.imgur.com/zCZLR1n.jpg)I work in one of the Wet Seal stores this is happening in and it's awful! Our sick time is not ""given"" to use, we have to accrue it like vacation days. My staff was given 24 hours notice before their last shift and my assistants and myself are having to work in the store by ourselves so corporate can avoid paying out extra money to associates. I also have an associate in my store who has been with me for over a month, her pay card was not activated by corporate and when we called about it we find out the lady in charge of that department had taken a vacation and literally tons of other girls were not receiving money on their pay cards either. This whole situation is crappy for all people on the bottom of the totem pole and I'm honestly just glad to be done with this company. Same story here in [North Carolina](http://imgur.com/j8b4jHn).  I know a store manager over there who has been told nothing but lies over the last month when questioning why their store wasn't receiving new inventory.  Classy company.  That's pretty fucked up. Not getting paid for your sick leave is par for the course... Most retail employees don't even get paid sick days. A $95,000 raise for the CEO is legitimately undetectable in terms of corporate cash flow. That being said, giving your employees one day to find a new job is absolutely awful. My girlfriend was a manager at Borders, the book store, when before they went bankrupt. The employees were strung along for quite some time, but eventually they came clean and said ""we're closing in 3 weeks, liquidate everything"". Most of the employees stayed during that time because it was pretty much the easiest retail job they could ever have for 3 weeks. ""What're they gonna do, fire me?""My partner works for H&M. He's a 5 year employee. He now has 5 weeks vacation, 14 days 'personal' time and healthcare for both of us (domestic partner insurance) that costs less that $50/month with a tiny deductible. I've worked for Apple, Samsung and Canon. I've never had benefits as good as he gets. 

Just chiming in to say retailers can do right by their people. as a stocky 30 year old male, I will be sure to never shop there again.From someone who is ignorant, why are so many Wet Seal stores closing?
Good for them. I have no idea what Wet Seal is but good for them. A month with no check, commendation to the person who didn't burn that building to the ground.Shitty ass corporations man. I worked at a pizza hut a few years back and they told us the store was going to eventually close, but never gave us a date. So I stroll into work one day and find the store locked, and closed signs all over it. Not even a call. Good riddance. 

I hope those poor employees find something else. A place where they aren't so much screwed over. They are lucky all the employees did is make a sign, and not just take turns shitting on the floor before walking outMy company's CEO got a $3mil raise last year while we were in financial hardship.Going to be a tough week for Wet Seal's social media team...if they even have jobs anymore.","[0.968337, 0.084177, 0.037523, 0.061465, 0.055768, 0.067, 0.0, 0.215, 0.274, 0.204, 0.455, 0.591, 0.777]"

Goede actie.Just an FYI to the folks who are confused about hypoglycemia...most likely this woman has diabetes, probably Type I which is insulin dependent. Anyone who has this knows what a royal pain in the rear it is...constantly checking your blood sugar, adjusting your food intake, insulin intake, activity level to attempt to simulate a non-diabetic's blood sugar. Even with constant vigilance, your blood sugars can dip low or go high, for sometimes unknown reasons (is this infusion set on my insulin pump blocked? I worked a little harder raking the leaves and didn't eat enough...I have a cold, maybe that's why my glucose is high? Etc). Managing the disease is a total balancing act. This mom prob went into hypoglycemia because it was dinner time and she was going to eat soon but her blood sugar dropped too low before she got a chance to eat,and she got confused or was behaving abnormally or became unresponsive. Scary stuff. I am glad the police helped her out like they did. Serious respect for these guys. They're the model that all policeman should follow.

Also I hope at least one of them is single.And these are the guys that had to fight and go on strike to get a better CAO (collective agreement), incomprehensible. Goeie jongens.Most of redditors are from Netherlands.I was reading this thinking ""Woah! This is totally unheard of!   ... Oh, Netherlands, well then it makes sense""

Edit: I was just expressing my initial reaction to reading this. You're all right of course, that there are plenty of American police with good intentions, and it gets drowned out by either bad cops or just that it's hard to be nice when you're surrounded by gang violence...  FTP - Fix The Police ... And also inner-city/organized crimeIf this had happened in the United States the woman would have hired a lawyer and sued the cops, their department, and the city.  Well when the crime rate is so low you don't have a couple dozen report/complaint calls stacked up to go to after the current one (not to mention whenever high priority calls come in in-between) you've got time to cook dinner and do dishes. 

 Personally, I think the good cops (not the minority haring trigger happy ones) would have a much better time at ""community relations"" if they were better staffed or crime was lower.  This is probably why old people remember friendly cops who they got to know and such. Those cops has fewer calls and more time to reach out.Tijd om 112 te bellen!

And of course the legend has it that the crates are waterproof.

Sample text from page 1, see page 2 fire some more cool pictures:

> Jeeps were produced and packed this way for shipment to U.S. forces and countries like England and the Soviet Union who the U.S. supplied during WW II. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Richmond, CA, about 70% of production was boxed due to their close proximity to the San Francisco port.

> Boxing up a jeep was expensive and time consuming so it was only done when absolutely necessary. Jeeps that were crated were complete vehicles, not a box of parts — windshields were folded, wheels taken off and a few other things done to minimize the cubeage. Very few, if any, of these crated jeeps remained in the United States, even during the war. After more than sixty years, there are probably none left. Several organizations and dealers have had a substantial reward offer for years for anyone who can produce one and no one has claimed the money.

PartMy grandfather once bought a used amusement park ride on e-bay, and it came in a single package like this. Obviously it was much larger, delivered on a flatbed tractor trailer.

My family spent a couple weeks helping him assemble it in our corn field, but we had to stop just short of completion when it became clear that it wasn't a theme park ride, but some gigantic animatronic roadside advertisement for a Venezuelan brothel.Americans left a bunch of these behind in the Philippines after WW2 and filipinos turned it into an episode of Project Runway.Ikea supplies the military now?Fun fact: The tire tread on the jeep is designed so that it is difficult to tell which direction the vehicle was headed if you encounter a set of tracks.[75 years old this year!](http://m.imgur.com/1zXPME0?r)The orginal jeep was pretty amazing.

Ok, I got a response back from Arcaid. They told me the photo was placed with them by EWA, and gave me the name of a photographer, Friedhelm Thomas. http://www.ewastock.com/preview/83516

EDIT: 

I was able to speak with Friedhelm Thomas on the phone this morning. It was hard to communicate because of the language barrier, however I wrote them an email in English with a link to the image, asking if he took the photo and if he did, where it was taken. If they respond, I will post it here.


EDIT 2:

The photographer replied to my email, confirming that the photographer is Friedhelm Thomas and that they would respond on the weekend, when they have some help with responding to my email in English.


EDIT 3:

Friedhelm Thomas told me the photo is from 1985 and the steel and glass structure was dilapidated at that time. He does not know what happened to it since then.
The exact location of the photo was over the hotel Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo near Lake Como in northern Italy. The location of the “wintergarden” is Griante/Cadenabbia. The park belongs to Villa Maria, a variant of the world-renowned garden of Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo.

EDIT 4:

It looks like the Villa Maria has undergone a restoration since 1985.
Here is a [photo](http://www.mondolariano.it/GrianteCadenabbia/serrav.jpg) of it after
 restoration- [photo] (http://www.arteliberty.it/immaginiliberty/como/serra.jpg)

Another angle: [photo] (Here is a photo taken from abovhttp://www.alephcomo.com/Gallerie.aspx?gid=1&fid=1e:)
Here is what Google has to say about Villa Maria: ""Villa Marie is surrounded by a splendid public park, in the centre of the village. It was built between 1889 and 1892 for the will of Martin Clerc and was completed by a heir of his, called Josephine May. The project was realized by the famous architect Giacomo Mantegazza.""I'm always curious what would cause a place like this to become abandoned.

Hey guys, look over here, /u/Peakoe89 doesn't know how to play heady-limey!!!!Clearly, that woman is sublime.She's got lime on her mind while she's touching her behind.The lime is integral to the exercise experience.  If you do not use the head lime, you are no better than a cross-fit newbie and aren't getting any value from the exercise at all.  You will probably hurt yourself and your margaritas will never taste any good.   That's no lime, she's a sim!Lime for scale.I'm trying to think of some possible reason as to why she might be holding a lime on top of her head and I'm coming up with nothing.

To get a mixture of the iron nickle alloy and olivine this meteorite came from a small protoplanet from the dawn of our solar system that melted from the original [chondrite](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/space/meteorites-dust/meteorite-types/stony/) material and separated into  an iron alloy and silicate phases (core and mantle). Towards the end of the protoplanet's life it experienced a very violent collision with another body and forced the contact between the core and the mantle to become perturbed via shockwaves from the impact- hence the mixing. 

Impacts like this lead to bigger and bigger bodies and eventually the terrestrial planets... so this is kind of an baby picture of the Earth.

Edit: [just wow](http://imgur.com/qBLSJ5s)I lived with a roommate who had a great dog.  I loved that dog to the moon and back.  But it would bark at passers by.  It's the single only aggressive thing she ever did.  We didn't want her barking at the neighbors or their kids so we used to say ""No, dog!  No barking!""  and she'd just look at us, then keep barking.

Then one day I kind of imagined what must be going through her head...  

She's like, ""OH FUCKING SHIT! There are some assholes outside our badass good-guy-team castle! They're THREATENING our goddamn HOME fuckin' BASE!! RARARARAWR RAHRAWR!!!!""

And all she gets from us is just, ""Bad, Dog! SHHHHHHhhhhhh! No Barking!!""

Panicked, she puzzles out the problem, realizing suddenly, *Oh SHIT! That's right!  You two helpless yet lovable lumps don't have the amazing sense of smell and super-dog-hearing that I do!*  But not to worry, that's exactly her job.  Let the humans know what's going on so they can let her out the front door to start killing shit.

Dauntless, she vows not to let the interlopers get by without warning everyone in the house first. 

""I WILL FUCKING PROTECT YOUUUUUUUuuuu! RHAWRHAHRAHRAWR RAWRRAH!!""

And suddenly feel like the poor girl is just trying to keep us safe.  So after I imagined this whole scenario out I kind of decided to try changing my approach the next time.  So the following interaction went completely differently.

She started barking, and this time instead of, ""Shhh, NO!"" I was like ""Good Job, pooch! I see them too!"" And I came up and patted her on the back.  And she chilled right the hell out.  Back to her nap.

I swear this worked 100% of the time.  She even kind of just started the habit of looking at me. If I was looking back she would just let it be.

""We good? Yeah, we good.""

I miss that dog.  She's old now but still healthy. My roommate and I moved out of that place.  He's got some kids for the dog to play with so she's probably very happy.  

But I felt like the damn dog whisperer when I pulled that mind meld shit with the dog.  I bet it'll work for others too.  Seriously try it.  Let me know.

[Edited some formatting mistakes]Am I the only one who wouldn't trust random strangers with this?Of course now he will forever be pestering passers by for treats, which could potentially make some people quite nervous.Now he'll learn to bark at strangers to get a treat. Cute idea, not solid in practice. On the other hand, that could be the lesser of two weevils.ITT:  Lots of people who don't understand how dogs work.That's a great idea! But aren't you afraid that he will warm up to strangers given this habit even if it's a robber in the middle of the night?Irish Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier? What if he accidentally bites someone and they call animal control?Has nobody noticed that they spelt it thaks, not thanks?I don't agree with this approach, especially in this context. Dog will grow to expect treats from strangers. What about the one time that the stranger puts their hand out and there is no treat?  I'd prefer food refusal from strangers and to engage/train the dogs with other people around in order to desensitize them.As great as this idea may seem, it's extremely counter intuitive.
I'm certified by the APDT and focus on dog psychology and behavior, and the first and foremost important thing to remember is that dogs are not humans and their psychology is completely different. Something that works one way in the human world can have a drastic difference in the minds of dogs.

I can go on for days as of why I would not recommend the method displayed in OP's picture, but I'll try to keep it short. I once worked with a 7 year old German Shepard named Daisy. Daisy had two bad habits; she would bark at the door when someone would stand outside/attempt to enter, and she was also terrified of fireworks. As humans, when we see that someone we care about is afraid of something, we tend to nurture them and tell them that ""it's all going to be alright,"" etc. People do the exact same thing with their dogs when they seem scared or startled; they pet them and nurture them. The problem with this is the fact that what you're actually doing, despite of your good intentions, is encouraging their fear. Petting a dog is a form of encouragement and by petting them or nurturing them when their minds are in a scared state, you're actually feeding into the issue rather than helping it.

Now, back to Herbie. If Herbie has a fear of bypassers, then having them reward her state of mind is not what you'd want to do. You have to make sure (this is really important!) that you reward the right state of mind. Dogs live in the now; not yesterday or tomorrow. You have to make sure you can comprehend what state of mind your dog is in before you start rewarding them with treats. 

Those are just my two cents...Fence aggression is caused by the neglectful action of leaving dogs unattended outside in a yard. 

The dog sees a passerby and begins barking. 

The passerby has no reason to stop and engage the dog and so continues on their way. 

The dog associates the passerby leaving as their having driven them off.

This gets reinforced every time that a passerby transits the fence line.

The real solution is to actually TRAIN your dog to not ever bark at passerby by staying with them during the first TWO years of their life when outside to properly TRAIN them not to be an ANNOYING noise disturbance, NOT hand the responsibility over to strangers that don't want hear your dog BARKING at them, not to mention the neighbors, and be tasked with doing what YOU should be doing.

tl;dr It's your dog, you fucking train it.Herbie The Love DogBefore:
Bark bark bark (get away from my home!)

After:
Bark bark bark (give me treats!)From a veterinary student: Never punish a dog to treat fear. You would be pairing fear with fear which strengthens the initial fearful stimulus. Just wanted to say that first so people don't beat their dogs when they cower at fireworks. Now for the initial case, giving him treats when he barks at people he will bark more. He thinks ""whenever I bark I get treats"". So you reinforce the behavior. Unfortunately there is not a great way to treat this one if the owner isn't present because people ignoring the dog and walking by makes him think ""barking at people makes them leave"". And if this is his goal, the behavior has been reinforced. However the case with fireworks is a little different. This would be an example of counterconditioning. You should pair a positive stimulus with the fearful stimulus. So give treats and attention when fireworks happen. They realize when fireworks happen good things happen too. Thunder shirts provide comfort and can work great with mild fear of fireworks. Punishment though, is really never the first thing to go to and can really damage the human-animal bond. I bet he still barks at them though because he thinks he's being rewarded for barking at them as they passed by.","[1.0, 0.085683, 0.985588, 0.060169, 0.051869, 0.126, 0.0, 0.364, 0.187, 0.049, 0.8, 0.605, 0.902]"

I live in San Francisco and I don't remember it being too contentious of a subject, but the Bay Area in general is dealing with the effects of extreme income inequality and gentrification right now. 

Plus some feelings might have changed after the clusterfuck that was super bowl city. Very true.  My highschool burned down in 1998.  It took us almost six months to even get textbooks.  We had to eat in circus tent half the next year.  There was even a proposal of taking all our money, building a brand new school on the rich side of town, and then give us the old school they were currently using in the middle of town.  They didn't even start building the new school a month before I graduated in 2000 because the idea of building a modern school on the poorer side of town was so controversial.  Granted it did only take a year to build from that point.  But I only had a school for two out of four years because of politics.Because the type of company hired to build a stadium consists of proactive doers.

Edited for those that needed help.> Why does it take a year to build a stadium

Because it doesn't. Taking a quick trip [over to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium), here are the key dates:

* 2007: Santa Clara starts working on project to build a stadium
* 2008: negotiations begin
* June 2009: agreement is made between 49ers team and city of Santa Clara
* December 2009: owners of Great America file lawsuit, which is dismissed
* June 2010: voters approve plan (Measure J).
* 2011: 49ers begin pre-sales of seats, boxes
* December 2011: Santa Clara secures funding
* February 2012: 49ers secure funding
* April 2012: groundbreaking at construction site
* July 2014: stadium opens

If you include everything, it basically took 7 years. Even if you forget all the planning and financing, construction itself took over 2 years, and obviously there would have been a lot of design work before that (probably going back to shortly after the Measure J approval).Maybe your school is full of vandals./r/ToMotivateYouBecause it took longer than 1 year to build Levis stadium.

We are pumping out entire generations of children who ""graduate"" from high school with a 2nd grade reading level, absolutely no marketable skills, no hope for the future, living in bad areas filled with violent crime, and we are worried about a stadium?

It's only a matter of time until things get much, much worse around here.  We've already let things go for FAR too long, but when the AP students in a school only have teachers in 3 of their 7 classes in a day, what hope do any of them have at having a real life?

We have got a lot of work to do and meanwhile the deeply, **DEEPLY** racist people around here are all scrambling to find another major league team to come and let us pay for a stadium for them.

It's obscene how passionate some people are for sports in this city versus how utterly ignorant or apathetic they are about these important issues.  A few miles of freeway isn't going to protect us all forever and eventually, ignoring a huge swath of our population and basically relegating them to a life of poverty with the white flight epidemic in this area is going to come back to bite us HARD.

Fuji around December of 2014, from the shores of Yamanakako. Love that mountain, but fuck climbing her ever again (5 is enough).

I live in Seattle, and the haze is awful, I can't imagine what it's like near the fires. Most of central Washington is on fire. Glad you're safe OP.I hope your doing okay OP, home and all. I've been through something similar to this, in New Mexico. It fucking sucks.This may be a stupid comment, but it blows my mind that the fires on the west coast have produced a thick haze all the way over here in Denver for the last couple of days. I could barely see the sun setting and the mountains last night and I live in the foothills. Yeah, we got all your smoke over here in the Auburn Valley. It just, sits there... Like most of the people around here.On the plus side, all that smoke will go up into the sky where it turns into stars.So it looked like Hell?I've been to Kvatch before, I know how this ends.""If you're going through hell, keep going"" - ChurchillAt the end of the road lies The River Styx.   Do you have any ""before"" pictures of this area ?  To compare to...The entire state is covered in smoke right now, all of it; Beijing smog end to end. I knew my town was smokey the last couple days from the fires but I didn't get a grasp of just how widespread this was until my cross state road trip today. There's over a dozen different wildfires in Washington right now. We were evacuated - daytime - from Chelan last weekend.  Was a very bizarre adventure.

Yes, there is roughly 100 left in other countries. But the minimum viable population for any species is generally between 50-150. That means this species is extremely close to being doomed to die out. I'm not associated with the WWF or any related organisations, and I would encourage anyone to do their own research before donating, but I hope at least one person will consider it. It should be changed to extirpated. They still exist in other areas of the world but have been extirpated in Malaysia [deleted]Why humans can't have nice things Way to go, humans.Humans are shit Goddamm dentists!Idk why but some small part of me is disgusted with my self as a human being for being on the earth and allowing this kind of shit to happen. There are still more Sumatran rhinos in Sumatra and Borneo.

And you'd think reddit hates China or something. Sumatran rhinos aren't often poached. And even if they are, Chinese people don't typically make viagras out of rhino's ivory.I'm just surprised the little guy has hair.Fuck humansJust to clarify why rhinos (in general) are going extinct, and why it will happen so quickly: Of course, one of the larger factors is poaching, and is probably one of the easiest for you all to donate towards. Because of this poaching, scientists have essentially been forced to breed rhinos in a way that does not promote genetic diversity (we don't want to say that they are essentially inbred, but they are almost clones of each other). Because of the lack of genetic variance, any small thing (diseases, disruption in food source, geographic dislocation, etc.) will pretty much wipe them off the face of the earth. 

Also, in case you didn't know, cheetahs are in the same boat. Although their numbers in the wild are relatively large at the moment, any small disease could wipe out wild cheetahs in the next year.One day in the future kids are going to find it hard to believe that animals once lived in the wild and that the wild used to consist of something more than a fucking Walmart parking lot. Just so some rich dudes in China can try to get their dicks hard.http://news.discovery.com/animals/endangered-species/sumatran-rhinos-now-extinct-in-malaysia-150820.htm

""Miller Man"" Maquette of large sculpture for ITW Welded Steel with a marble base 24"" x 7"" x 7"" By David Madero - 

I first used a Spectrum 875 plasma cutter to cut out the initial design from a steel tube. I then used a Millermatic 252 to spot weld steel rods on the tube as a base for the texture and the welding man figure. I continued by welding the gaps and unions between the steel rods leaving a highly texturized surface.  I finished the process using a Diversion 180 tig welder to form puddles giving the hills and valleys appearance.

Good on him. A lot of people don't realize that bringing a cold animal inside the house only stops them from losing heat as fast, they still have to warm up via metabolism. You have to put them in something hotter than body temperature to actually help them raise it.

But the fact of the matter remains that . . . you feel an enormous amount of responsibility for these animals. If I knew that a calf had frozen to death slowly over the course of a day and a half, I would feel tremendous guilt. The feelings would be overwhelming. Soup's on!Bad memories... We'd put our animals together and every house will herd them respectively in our village. The herders were always some kids escorted by adults. But someday one of our neighbours decided that he could do on his own. The weather that day was very bad. And it was spring so there was always a chance of some sheep or cow giving birth.

When I returned home from school I saw my mom sitting by a little lamb and crying. The lamb was trying to get up so hard but she couldn't. She was shaking and falling down. She was trying again and again. It was very hard scene. Our fucked up neighbour thought that the weather would'nt heart the lamb if he just picked her up and hold her.

Dafoe has a certain kind of crazy look that befits Two Face's identity crisis a lot better. He pulled it off well with Green Goblin and a more comic-version of Two Face (who acts a bit different from movies and games) would suit Dafoe really well, I think.

He could probably do Joker crazy just fine too, but I think Two Face would end up coming out better.Simple, his dick is too big.Already been the Green Goblin.Easy - he doesn't want his ass kicked.

He'd be waaay too convincing and the next thing you know, the real Batman is showing up at his place throwing elbows and grunting all throatily. How about for a Batman Beyond movie?He can't be.

Edit: sometime around 2 am, I was woken up by a low moan that had a slightly aggressive tone to it (the moan lasted about 10 seconds). I grew up near mountains and cows and had never heard anything like that before. 

It freaked me out and I went from dead asleep to pulse racing at maximum just about instantly. I sat up and thought and listened for maybe 10 seconds then I flung open the tent and ran for the truck. I was wearing only underwear and the truck was 50ft away. I made it and rolled down the window a bit to look and listen. 

I had no weapons on me.

Total, I camped out there in the same spot for 3 months and this happened about half way through.

Years later, I listened to mountain lion sounds on YouTube and confirmed that it was a lion. He was maybe 20 to 50 ft from my tent and I think he was kindof asking a question. He was curious and wanted to see what I was. I never saw him and never heard him again.Where was this taken?

Eh, who cares?I used to be the guy that thought about leaving a note.  Then I saw this comic.
http://spillmybeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-parking-problems-comic-picture.jpgWhen I was a kid my dog got really sick and we rushed her to the vet. My dad parked shittily like the guy in your pic because he was in such a hurry to get the dog looked at. The dog died while we were in there and when we left someone had left a note under my dad's wiper saying he was an asshole for parking like that. I never saw my dad look as defeated as he did in that moment.

TL;DR - You never know what someone else is dealing with. I'm getting a beer.[deleted]That is clearly a tortoiseKeep in mind, it is not fair to judge someone's parking ability if you don't actually watch them as they are parking. It is pretty likely that the car you are looking at was forced to park like this due to someone else being parked improperly next to them.In High School, the girl who parked in front of me was 1-2 feet into my spot EVERY FUCKING DAY. I just let it go, but by the end of the year, I was like whatever, I'll leave a funny note. 

""Just so you know  -- (insert drawn picture of a ruler with an arrow pointing at the 12 inch mark)

you were this far into my spot every day this year. 

Best of luck with your future parking endeavors.""

She then made a point to yell ""asshole"" out the window at me whenever she saw me from that point on -- obviously not finding it as funny as I did. This is an incredibly passive aggressive way to behave.

We can still tip but the tip jar is near the register and probably need to ask for it.

The incentive for good service is not getting your ass fired while someone else takes you reasonably paying job.Wow, this thread is amazing-- thanks for the attention, everyone!  My little restaurant is flattered.  Just wanted to give you guys (and particularly the servers/ cooks/ restaurant owners out there) more details on what we're doing and how we do it!

First, it's not simply an increased hourly wage!  In addition to fully funded benefits for EVERY employee, full or part time, and $15/ hour, they all get a portion of the sales.  Waitstaff get 12% of their individual sales (remember, servers used to tip out 6% of their sales, so that's like a guaranteed 18% from every table, including takeout.)  Kitchen & support staff get a percentage of the shift's sales, depending on their roles. 

It's removed the judgement, assumptions, and emotions that living off tips entailed; my servers love that.  And of course I don't take any cash they DO receive; if they do so well that someone wants to reward them extra, more power to them, that's theirs to keep.  And it happens... because my staff is incredible :)  

Come visit us in San Francisco sometime!Reddit loves a great tipping thread, but what this restaurant is saying is that ALL of their staff (bussers, dishwashers, cooks &amp; servers) are paid a living wage.  Kudos.

Serving is tough, but the kitchen is just as valuable to the dining experience. The restaurant that I work at pays minimum wage, we get tipped, but we also get profit sharing. We also get fully funded health, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) with employer match and discounts to climbing gyms and other places to boot. 

I enjoy working there.Are there any servers here that wouldn't be okay with this? My friend is a server and she says she regular makes $20+ / hour when you average her tips, and closer to $30 if she does that thing that absolutely no servers do - not reporting their tips to the IRS. That is a sweet benefits package I must say, but she's told me she'd quit serving if she ever averaged less than $20 / hr.Picture of a menu. I like the Italian way: no obligation, no forced tips, no shared jar. You liked the service exceptionally? Leave some extra money on the table when you leave. Your waiter will take it completely for himself.Redditor: ""Instead of a tip I have left you with this informative card which expains how the tip system exploits the lower class."" <tips fedora> ""M'lady.""So basically it's like how restaurants work in the entire rest of the world. USA takes another step forward!I hate the tip system in the U.S. 

As a black person, whenever I go to a restaurant, they think I won't tip, so they give me poor service. This leads me to want to tip poorly, but I still always give at least 15%. 

I wish tip wasn't part of it and it was just a fixed price.Sounds better than 

**35% Tip included in Menu Prices**so 20% markups are already included in the prices.I just went here! Really good. Really french waitress. That's OK. I'll take my tipping position which averages me around 30-35/hr.Move to Europe LOL Zazie is in SF. They're required by law to provide health insurance. It's also a California law to provide Paid Sick Leave. ""Living Wage,"" which is how much exactly? Because SF is fucking expensive and their poverty wage would go pretty far in Sacramento. I know I'm in the minority here, but I *like* the practice of tipping. It's one of the few times where I can, unilaterally, decide the value of a good or service **after** getting it. 

At the couple of restaurants where I show up at fairly regularly, I always get excellent service, they remember what I like, and treat me like I'm a valued customer. And I'm not by any means rich nor do I tip more than a pretty typical amount. 

I'd actually be disappointed to have tipping taken out of the equation in a lot of places. Define living wage...This is actually a great restaurant too. Good food, nice wine, neat ambiance. I've taken a few dates here. It's a nice spot if you find yourself in Cole Valley, SF. I'm glad we don't have tipping where I live.The fact remains that, at a flat daily wage, a busy day is worse for a waiter than a slow day.

The tip system, with all its flaws, does achieve one thing. It makes wait staff *want* the place to be bustling. It puts management and employees on the same page, keeping the place as busy as possible is how everybody gets their payday. 

When a waiter gets tips, they see a large party coming through the door and they get excited. When they don't, they see a large party coming through the door and they sigh. More work, same pay.As a hospitality worker in SF, this is as outrageous as it is hilarious.  They pay their employees $15 an hour, sounds like a lot for other parts of the country, but keep in mind that is set to be our *minimum* wage by 2017 (current minimum wage is $12.25).  Saying that is a livable wage for a restaurant in the Bay Area, nevertheless in SF itself is simply not true.  The total cost of living in San Francisco is 62.6% higher than the U.S. average, and we have the most brutal real estate/rent situation in the country right now (http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2015/06/02/san-franciscos-median-rent-hits-a-ridiculous-4225/)
A tipped position in the Bay Area allows you to make double or more than what they are paying.  Also, while I encourage them to let people know they are providing benefits and doing what ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY, but specifically discouraging any extra gratuities is silly and will hurt service in the long run.  They will lose real talent because competent and hospital servers/bartenders that go above and beyond will leave because working here is basically getting payed what you would at McDonalds.Tipping culture always confused me when I was younger and I used to visit the US a lot, having grown up in England. Here its basically set up as mentioned in the sign and the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour (although it's set to increase to £9.00 an hour) plus the government will pitch in quite generously in terms of benefits if you're stuck on minimum wage (but waiting staff normally are not, depending on the establishment). Saves a whole lot of hassle when paying though... And if you want to tip on top of that you can: for exemplary service.","[0.956596, 0.05457, 0.049403, 0.060894, 0.05259, 0.37, 0.081, 0.0, 0.222, 0.173, 0.599, 0.624, 0.788]"

Link related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter

Also, I heard a story of a student who was in a class where the teacher allowed students to only write on one side of a sheet. He twisted the sheet and attached it to itself as a Möbius strip.I always loved note-card allowed exams. I thought I was getting one over on the teacher (Hah! I wrote suuuuper small, take that!) but I always ended up learning more of the material because I actually spent time studying by putting together my card.I had a classmate in high school peel the index card apart into layers and then print off typed notes to paste on each layer. The kid ended up with like 5 extra sides on his notes. The teacher was so astounded that a 16 year old would think of this that he allowed the kid to use the note card.  From then on out, that teacher clearly stated that this isn't allowed. Talk about interpretating the rules haha.

PS: Forgive my grammar mishaps (I know its interpreting), as the drunken redneck within me came out last night.My Differential Equations professor always used to say, you may use one piece of paper. If you are creative enough, you can use all 6 sides.When they wear them on each eye the answers pop out in 3DThis kid is going placesWhy the hell aren't they printing a 3x5 notecard in 3 point fonts and bringing reading glasses?Story time:

There was a legend in the math department at my college that a professor allowed students to use an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper full of notes for the final exam.  The only problem was that the prof didn't specify units of measurement so some smart-ass (or possibly genius) student got a hold of a sheet of butcher paper that was 8 1/2 FEET by 11 FEET.  Since the prof hadn't specified units of measurement, he ended up letting the kid use it, but from then on he always made sure to say that an 8 1/2 INCH by 11 INCH sheet of paper could be used for notes on the final.

I will say that your student's method of bending the rules is far more creative and less smartassy than the student in my story.I did something similar, except for a multivariable calculus final. We were allowed both sides of a 5"" × 7"" notecard. So I wrote out my notes first horizontally on the card, then turned the card 90° and wrote in a different color on both sides again.
So long as you use colors that are markedly different and not too dark, it works well.So that kid gets an A for being a genius right?The thing I remember most about these notecard style exams is that most of the stuff I wrote down I ended up remembering just from the act of taking the time to write it.

He said it was still 3 by 5 so he was still following the rules. She let him get away with it but never forgot to say inches after that.","[0.826095, 0.938878, 0.783487, 0.041794, 0.31355, 0.208, 0.106, 0.0, 0.402, 0.254, 0.404, 0.6, 0.713]"

It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.""

You can (and people do) climb all over the stones. 

I spent the night at Stonehenge for summer solstice 7 years ago. There were some Druid rituals - I remember a parade with flaming torches and giant furry animal heads - but mostly people were just there to party. There were drum circles everywhere, some food vendors, and lots of drinking and smoking. 

Unfortunately, it drizzled the whole time, so we didn't get to see the sunrise through the stones. But I was glad the weather forced me to wear wellies, because man, those porta potties grew increasingly biohazardous as the night wore on. Edit to change my opinion. Apparently they trash it every year and it's kinda sad. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11455098/Stonehenge-damaged-with-chewing-gum-and-graffiti-during-Winter-Solstice.htmlMy dad said that when he was a kid in the 60's, stonehenge was just this random thing off the highway, with one tiny little sign, and you just parked on the highway shoulder and walked over to it.  You could climb on it, there was some small graffiti on it, and nobody cared, because there was nobody there.

We went again as a family in 2006, and you had to park in a parking lot far away, pay an entry fee, walk through this long underground tunnel that took you underneath the highway with a bunch of infographics on the walls, then you come to stonehenge and it's all roped off with velvet and you just slowly walk around it in a circle with the group, stopping occasionally to take pictures.They left that place in ruins.This is why we can't have nice things.

What a bunch of fucking arseholes.Funny, they didn't look Druish.As a janitor, I'm impressed. After that many people this looks pretty tame. Is no one in this thread able to realise that most of the 23,000 aren't hippies and are just party-goers?also, plenty of other people. I mean, if you've got 23,000 people, some subset of them are gonna be assholes no matter what.

You could probably make this title 23,000 gamers, white people and self-stylied atheists and be equally as accurate.*Shocking* that a group of 23k people left trash on the ground. 20k out of the 23k could have cleaned up all their mess and you're still left with the mess of 3k people. >Claims to celebrate and respect the earth

>Leaves a bunch of paper/petrol-based garbage at an ancient Druid heritage site.http://i.imgur.com/tNx7nB4.gifI went to Stonehenge a few years ago and they had a rope fence up about a hundred feet from the stones because people vandalized the stones. 
then people do shit like this, nothing pisses me off more than seeing a place people hold sacred trashed by 23k of the absolute scum of society. I think most of them aren't really hippies or druids, just people who like a party.Gotta love that Hipster hypocrisy ;) ""But man, we love mother earth! She is so beautiful, lets throw our trash all over it.""

You've missed the photo where loads of people stayed behind to clear up. This is disgusting.If anyone's ever been they'll know it's mainly populated by local chavs looking for an excuse to get wrecked. Not trying to defend their actions here but I bet if you put a group of 23000 of anybody it would look the same.I was there for the whole event and I can tell you there were people from all social circles. There were plenty of new-agers and hippies but they were heavily outnumbered by the general public.

The event is part of a religious holiday that's open to anyone and although there were volunteers picking litter, you have to expect some debris from 23,000 people moving in and around the stones.

Otherwise it was an absolutely electric night, people chanting, playing bongos and dancing around the circle into the early hours was amazing to see. I even saw a guy playing a saxophone to one of the stones.I was there

I am there every year

Loads of local chavs and non hippies turn up to get fucked up and ruin the vibe.

""From there the story takes a tragic turn. The next month Yoina’s mother, Carmen, died after giving birth to her ninth child. The baby—named Grace Kelly at the suggestion of a visiting nurse’s wife—was adopted by Carmen’s sister. The aunt also cares for Yoina, who shaved her head in mourning. But the sad events did not stop there. Soon after, Yoina’s pet tamarin was killed when it overturned a boiling pot on itself. The family buried it.

When our reporter Emma Marris went to Manú, she sought out Yoina. The girl still lives with her aunt and helps care for baby Grace. On that visit Yoina had less hair but a bit more of a smile, in gratitude for the gift of a photo with her pet.""By Charlie Hamilton James. He writes: Yoina aged nine with her pet saddle-back tamarin. Last year I was shooting an article for National Geographic Magazine on Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon. I had travelled deep into the park to a community called Yomibato, home to indigenous Machiguenga people (aka Matsigenka) as I wanted to look at how Manu’s indigenous people live within the world’s most bio-diverse national park. Every day Yoina and her friends would walk through our camp on the way to the river to swim. The monkey would come with her, even though it hated swimming. To escape the water the tamarin would always try to get onto Yoina’s head, where it felt more secure. Life for Yoina and the tamarin changed dramatically shortly after this image was taken. Their story and the story of Manu features in the June issue of National Geographic Magazine and on the NG website.

It made me feel sick.
Although this has been posted before, I will take it upon myself to repost one of the funniest things I've read in the comments section.  
  
The life of a rhododendron owner  
1. That is pretty I want that for my garden  
2. Ooh it's growing quickly!  
3. Maybe I should cut it back?  
4. Okay it's taking over my garden I will cut it a bit  
5.Oh my God why won't it stop growing?!  
6.Did I used to have a garden and a house? Was there a time before the rhododendron forest?!  
7.Please for the love of God neighbours if you can hear me bring chainsaws  
8.Why won't it stop growing?! Why won't it die?!  
9.Maybe if I trim it constantly without eating or sleeping or pooing I can't reach an equilibrium and contain it?  
10.They call me the rhododendron man, I had another name once in a lifetime a long time ago..

When I was about 8, my family moved to a new house. Our grandparents shipped the gifts to our old house by mistake. However, that postwoman saw our names on the package right before Christmas and went above and beyond to track us down and get us the presents to us in time. 

If she hadn't been so amazing, we would have gotten our gifts weeks late - if we had gotten them at all. 

I've always had such huge respect for the postal service. They always do an incredible job. Sadly most people will not give a fuck, or understand.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7mRg74qcY&feature=youtu.be) of this bitch in action.A gif of the little thing 

http://static.businessinsider.com/image/556cd32d69bedd3c21964422/image.gifv>While the device may look like a toy, it’s certainly not priced like one. The PD-100 Black Hornet 2 prices at about $40,000 for larger orders of the device, said Ole Aguirre, VP of business development for Prox Dynamics. But considering that the Pentagon plans to spend approximately $2.9 billion on unmanned systems for the fiscal year of 2016, according to the Drone Center at Bard College, the $40,000 price tag doesn’t seem so significant.

So in other words its a drop in the sieve.russia is ready: http://imgur.com/a83Ewgchttp://imhur.com/a/a1RHO6s.jpgI'm just happy that MiMS found a new job.There's more to that $40,000 package than just the PD-100 Black Hornet 2.  That case hanging off the guys chest houses the display and base station for it.

For what it's worth, it's not a bad little drone.  While it looks low tech it has 3 camera's, has a 2 mile range, can hit 22 mph and has a 25 minute flight time.  Perfect for the types of missions it's designed for, which primarily being spec ops missions, means it's not like they are going to buy so many of these that it dents the nearly $3B unmanned systems budget for next year.

EDIT:  Also worth noting, the British Army has already invested in these, and I believe the Australians have as well.  I also think that the drone itself is cheap and most of the money is in the ruggedized base station and software.  The company advertises the drone itself as ""Affordable - reusable and disposable"" which leads me to believe that replacing the drone itself is probably something more on the order of one of the CICADA systems drones, far cheaper than $40k.Should've waiting for the Black Friday deal. No army deals for Turkey day.This will get buried, but my idiot brother is the one holding the drone in this picture.  When I called him to tell him he made the front page of Reddit and was basically a celebrity, he responded with:  

""...  Cool...  What's Reddit?""Makes me wonder if they have Drones disguised as bugs now that they using to spy on people with. Hence why the Russians supposedly stop talking when they see a fly in the room.If the manufacturer sold more than 50 of them, the price probably would be closer to what we'd expect to pay ourselves. The Noisy Cricket. ""I feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing!""

Edit: Thank you for gilding my first ever comment.Haha... As much as I hate seeing expensive items on my property books that are cheaper in the civilian side... The prices on those items also reflect the entire package of service, maintenance, updates, repairs... As well as contribute to the contractor support when you need a person to come instruct or provide hands on service. 

Ofc this varies between items, but for items sold to the government a lot of the expenses are passed directly into the govt because they will pay it. If a business provides something they need, the govt can always justify the cost of whatever the business says it had (eg it took me 400,000 dollars to make the tools to make this drone, I need to sell it to you for 40,000 to break even or make money on this since you're buying such a limited number of them) You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?Carbon fiber blades, gold plated axis, 4K live streaming camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, 2-40Hz microphone, ultrasound and infrared sensors, stealth absorption paint, facial recognition software with target auto detect and auto follow, satellite communication, radar jammer, micro laser canyon, stun/freeze ray, not to mention that the contractor, designers and builders need to pass FBI background checks and DoD clearance so it all adds up to US$45,392.13 - Bald Eagle Freedom discount of US$5,392.13 = US$40,000.00.

It was one of the most surreal moments of my youth. the second photo captures just about everyone's reaction they would have if they just finished a tough climb and the skyline fucking exploded. I live in Washington and remember that day well. I was 13 years old. Myself and a friend had ridden our bikes a couple miles from home to go shoot our BB guns. We had gotten to our destination, taken a few shots, and saw some big dark clouds in the distance. Really big. Really dark. It looked like rain clouds so we started racing home trying to beat the downpour that we thought was coming. A couple minutes later the clouds caught up to us and it started snowing. Well, it looked like snow, but it was ash.  We couldn't really see very well by this point and it was getting pretty uncomfortable to breathe. We saw some headlights coming down the road and it was basically pitch dark at this point. The headlights stopped revealing a truck and the driver yelled at us to throw our bikes in the back and he would take us home. I remember we had been reading in school about Hiroshima and nuclear bombs, and I was pretty sure we had been nuked. The driver told us that ""Mount St. Helen's just blew up"" and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about but hearing the words ""blew up"" reinforced in my head that this was a nuclear war...or the start of one. Got home and saw the news.

That is how I found out that we have volcanoes in Washington and that I wasn't witnessing the start of World War 3.""Well, it's a good thing we didn't climb that one today.""I would just like to point out that in these pictures, Mt. St. Helens is 34 miles away. There had to have been some type of sonic boom that was out of this world seconds after they noticed the eruptionEven more intense are the [last photos from Robert Landsburg](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/234721-robert-landsburgs-brave-final-shots). 

""When the mountain exploded, he already had his camera on a tripod, aimed and cocked. As the all-engulfing cloud of ash climbed the sky toward him, four miles from the summit, he desperately cranked frames by frames across his lens, then rewound the film into its cassette inside the camera, wrenched the camera from its tripod, and stowed it in his backpack. His wallet was in the backpack too — perhaps to assure future identification.

Seventeen days later, his body was found in the ash, together with the film that cost him his life. It contained not only telling images of the killing edge of the blast but also the scratches, bubbles, warping, and light leaks caused by heat and ash, the very thumbprint of the holocaust.""I lived about 120 miles north, up in Snohomish, when it blew. Most of the ash ended up in Eastern Washington. [It turned day into night over there.](http://ecologicalsociology.blogspot.com/2010/05/it-was-30-years-ago-today.html)

edit: link My aunt and uncle struggled through the Great Depression then worked hard their entire lives. Finally they retired and built their dream retirement house on the banks of a river than flows from Mt. Saint Helens. Only a couple of months after moving in the mountain blew and they made it out with their lives with minutes to spare. Lost everything they owned except what they were wearing. Luckily their daughter had married a very rich guy and could take them in. But they never really recovered from the shock and died within a year or two after. I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time, and all I remember is that shit just about knocked me out of bed. Incredible BANG that shook the whole house, particularly my bedroom window. I hiked around Mt. Saint Helens in 1996, the side of the mountain that exploded was nuts.  There were areas where we were walking across fields of 1/2-inch round pumice that was deeper than you could dig, and then you would walk around a corner and be back in the forest for another few hundred yards, and then you would hit a line and back to the pumice field.  It was probably as close to walking on the moon as you can get without actually walking on the moon.  One of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.I watched it from our garage door about 30 miles to the upper left of this picture (meadow glade WA). Could never wrap my head around people selling the pens with ash in them...we could have made millions!Found this guy when reading up about this picture, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Randall_TrumanAny time I see Mt. Saint Helens photos I'm always reminded of Crater Lake (for obvious reasons). The crazy part is that native tribes were in the region when Mt. Mazama blew up to eventually become what we know as [Crater Lake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Crater_lake_oregon.jpg). Mt. Saint Helens was a huge deal even with the geology and volcano knowledge we have today. I can't imagine what had to be racing through their minds when Mt. Mazama erupted.

""Prior to its climactic eruption Mount Mazama had a summit elevation of about 3,700 m (12,000 ft). The present high point is Mount Scott at 2,721 m (8929 ft), 3 km (about 2 mi) east of the caldera rim. Today, the caldera rim ranges in elevation from approximately 2,040 m (6,700 ft) to 2,484 m (8,150 ft)""
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/crater_lake/crater_lake_geo_hist_133.htmlwhoa. thats terrifying. As a climber, theres always this thought in the back of your mind when you climb a volcano (even a dormant one) that it *could* erupt regardless of how incredibly unlikely that event is. Seeing this must have been a mix of emotions, awe, terror, dread, wonder, and concern for any one effected. 

Also, i'm 100% certain that those climbers were now facing extreme difficulty in returning to Seattle or Portland and were likely in danger from transportation/ash related problems. This is incredible. I don't think there's anything else to do at a moment like that except watch in awe.I was in Seattle when it blew and we all heard it. My dad and I flew from Seattle to California a couple hours later, and they changed our flight plan to go around it. I was a kid and didn't quite get the significance of what I was seeing, but my dad was jumping around in excitement climbing over people to get photos. He was a medical dr but his hobbies were geology and mineral collecting. (the mineral collection he spent his life collecting was donated to the Geology Department at UCLA and is in display cases lining the hallways of the geology building , if anyone is interested. Anyway, I think the guy in the window seat thought my dad was going to climb in his lap Would you stand and watch or run like heckDid they survive?If you're ever in the area be sure to visit Mt.

Marketer here.

You aren't their target audience. 

These magazines do TONS of market research or ""testing"" behind the scenes. They interview dozens upon dozens of people behind closed doors and ask them random questions. A lot of the answers given may seem bullshit to us, but market research is about picking up on the ""language"" that your target audience uses today. Hence, you see a difference in the way weight loss is described in the latter version. Same thing, but their target audience now describes their pain points in a different lingo. 

I bet this magazine conducted hundreds of interviews and picked up on pain points, the way their readers think and talk, how they describe situations, etc before they even released this cover.

It's actually SUPER easy to conduct market/customer/user research now. In the past, companies had to do in person interviews and focus groups in order to understand their target audience. That would take WEEKS to organize and conduct... Super slow process and quite frankly, dreadful. Now they go to companies like UserTesting and launch a quick, remote test and within 20 minutes have all the research they need.

Though fairly commonly, they're somewhat rarely seen because of their relatively short week-long adulthood. During this period of their lifespan, they do not have mouths, as a result do not eat, and exist solely to procreate.This obviously was staged by the moths for the sake of bankrupting the butterflies.

It's cafeteria in TCS, an IT company. Many companies display such data in the cafeterias.We did this at my summer camp to make kids aware of food wastefulness and not taking more than they'd eat. Went from over 150 lbs of wasted food the first day down to 45 by the end of camp. Guess they're also serving up guilt there.Near me there are a few ""All You Can Eat Sushi"" spots.

They will not serve you more until you clear everything on your plate. If you don't eat everything that came out, you can't order more. You also can't take it home.

This actually pissed me off the one time I went there with some people a while back. They make you order as a table. I'm very specific with sushi, so I ordered 2 or 3 specific rolls for myself, but when I finished they wouldn't let me order more because the table wasn't finished.

You see, the other people at my table were ... well ... idiots. They thought, ""Hey, it's all you can eat! Lets just order everything, even the stuff that doesn't sound appealing!"". 

They ordered more food than anyone could eat, didn't end up finishing it, and as a result I couldn't order more. I even asked the waitress if I could go on my own separate bill, to which they said, ""One table, one bill"".

They wasted a ton of food that night, and I was probably the only person in the history of an ""all you can eat"" restaurant who went home hungry.250g doesn't sound like a particularly big meal for those 180 peopleTata Consultancy Services.

People are lazy and they will avoid doing many trips to the bar. That is the ugliest number 5 I've ever seen. Fuck I'm tired. I originally saw wastage and thought that this was written in German or something However, that wouldnt have actually fed anyone. It instead saves the company money and gives them more profit. They are playing on your emotions for their gain.

Im a little cranky this morning apparently lol.[In other words: Don't do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCLXZmMQNs)i know some all you can eat places get around this by charging a fee if your plate isnt empty when you ask for the bill. which i think is perfectly acceptable, wasting food is a shame. 

edit: to the people whining, or saying what if i have 1 shrimp on my plate, use some common sense people. if you have a few small items, or stuff half eaten cause you didn't like it you wont be charged normally. it's the people who've had 3 plates are pretty full but think they can do one more round fill a plate and leave it half full. 

and to the people saying how do they charge you for it? well buffets are a set price, when your bill comes there will be a fee on top, it's not rocket science.. I wonder if this is 100% actual foods that you could have actually fed 180 people with or if they just weighed the waste bin... It's ironic this is a sign at Tata. Fuck this company and everything it stands for.But is it gonna feed 180 people, if it wasn't wasted? What are they gonna do with leftovers at the end of the day?A retaurant in my town makes you pay double if they see you wasting too much food. If you don't pay, they kick you out. Not like we would waste anything on the first place, but there will always be assholes.We did a similar thing when I went to school. The cafeteria had a clear tube that red balls were placed in for every x kilo thrown in the waste baskets. There was also a mark on the tube, and if we were lower than the mark by the end of the year, everyone would get ice cream.Do they weigh just the edible waste or are they including bones and shells?  If the former, who's separating these?  They should also post their profit for full transparencyTCS...   the sweatshop of the consultancy world...Buffet by definition is wasteful, they can take their side order of guilt and shove it.

I sure as hell hope that wall was designed to take the load and the rocks are supported to the lathe well.  Otherwise that thing is going to last 5-10 years tops.What exactly is used to hold the rocks in place...a certain kind of cement?In the boy scouts, they would warn us against using river rocks for our fire pit. I was told they can explode.This is by [Michael Eckerman](http://www.eckermanstudios.com/), [Here](https://www.pinterest.com/stacycats36/michael-eckerman-stone/) is some more of his stone work.The idea and execution are both really great, but the scale isn't good. It really overwhelms the house instead of fitting in and seeming like a part of it. Same thing but smaller would have been perfect.ITT: People who know about river rocks but not about fireplace/chimney construction. River rock is often used for fireplace surrounds and is easily found at many local landscape and decor specialty stores. The stones are not used directly in the fireplace where the heat is the highest. In addition, many stones are properly dried before being sold. 

They aren't wrong saying you shouldn't use river rock when making a camping fire. But, in this application, river rocks are completely fine and make for an aesthetically pleasing fireplace. It doesn't really matter what kind of stone it is as far as resisting heat.

Unless this was built some place that is completely wild west as far as building codes, this isn't a chimney and fireplace that is solely stone. There is a fireplace made out of fire brick and a specific heat resistant mortar. 

That feeds up into a smoke shelf which will be masonary and on top of that will be clay liners, wrapped in four inch block all the way up. There will also be four inch block providing the rectangular shape to lay the stone up to.

To sum it up: There is a clay liner that's an inch or more thick, a four inch block, at least an inch or two of space, then the four inch block exterior shell, another inch or two between the shell and the stone.

These stone are at least almost a foot away (with close to nine inches of heat resistant material in between) from any of that heat being produced in the fireplace and moving up and out through the chimney.and now there is a river with no rocks I admire the amount of technical skill and time put into this, but I think it looks really tacky. Nice idea, but the design make nauseous. I need order, sorry.Former mason laborer here - by far the funnest job I worked on was a huge entire house of irregular stone like this.  Basically it was a 2-month-long scavenger hunt, running from skid to skid looking for the right stone for the right spot.  Took longer and the rocks were harder to lift, but man it was a nice break from the monotony of brick-work.  And looked awesome when we were done!Nope. Sorry but it reminds me of the picture of the ticks in a dog's ear. I can't unsee that picture when I look at this chimney. I saw a picture once of a deer with hundreds of ticks in a group stuck to it and it looks like this fire placelooks amazing but how long do these actually last? the mortar will give way to weather and the rocks will fall out of place eventuallyi wonder what there is to stop rain from just falling right down and into your house.Looks like a hidden environmental puzzle from The Witness.These curves bother me. I like things that are square. I would be climbing that, in my childhood.Goddamn that's beautiful.

Man that's a gorgeous view. What a beautiful picture this is! In Japan, the moat, called ""Ohori"", is so important to the castle. Historicaly, when water would be a mirror, the sight is sooooooo amazing as this picture is so. Why is a pair of the castle (or sight) such awful. btw, I never been to Matsumoto Castle even if I live in Japan.

So is it travertine or marble?how ""gripy"" is resin? like if you were to try to slide a glass across the table would it grip to the table?What kind of resin is that? 

I need to know. For reasons. Please.This is a lot like Greg Klassen's tables in wood and glass. I think Klassen's work is, overall, nicer looking though. It also involves more work to cut the glass to match the curves:

The kid on the right, on top of the van taking the picture, looks like it was photoshoped. I lived in South Africa for years. There is almost zero chance these are ""commuters"". This is almost certainly inside a park, and those cars are tourists specifically there looking for lions and other wildlife. Look at all the cameras. Lions don't just wander around Africa. They are very rare and highly prized tourist attractions, and they're in very specific, fenced (but extremely large, think hundreds, or even thousands of square miles) areas.

Africa is not huts and wildlife. Africa has cell phones and shopping malls and McDonalds and Adam Sandler movies, same as everywhere else.Nice BALLSMust not have been any dentists near the front of the lineNairobi is the only city in the world to have a national park right next to the city. People who live close to the park have at times encountered cheetahs and hyenas when coming back home from a night out. So yeah, lions can sometimes show up outside the park. But it isn't a common occurrence, though. TIL Nairobi drivers need laser pointers. Fucking cats man ... They do whatever they want and dont care who they inconvenience. Place a potted plant on a table in the middle of the Savannah with nothing around it for miles and you bet your ass a fucking lion will show up and knock it over.Those people in the front line of cars with their windows open, very ballsy.Lion 1:  They're totally looking at my ass aren't they?

Little known fact, if you feed elephants lots of cheese that slows down their metabolism slightly and can, in very extreme cases, lead to dwarfism. The cheese can do this due to the way the enzymes in the cheese react with the elephants special type of stomach acid.

It was in the early to mid 1990s in Riverside California. I was standing outside of a backyard party ($3 at the gate). I think the Voodoo Glow Skulls or the Assorted Jelly Beans or Schlong or some other stupidly-named band was going to play. 

So I was outside I was,  waiting for some friends when from down the street came a slow moving car with a search light. Pandemonium broke out because the party was about to be busted. Shouts of ""five-oh! five-oh!"" were heard. People took off in every direction. They jumped over the back fences. I even heard someone tried to put the keg in the washing machine. 

So I'm out there and I'm afraid of nothing because I'm straight and I don't have pockets full of marijuana or speed.

[Shore breaks](https://youtu.be/EUXOZAinUPk)  
Other interesting facts about shore breaks.  
EDIT: Being from Hawaii I've thankfully learned how to duck dive under any wave, especially shorebreaks. As the name of the wave suggests, a shore break is a wave that breaks obviously close to shore. In my years of living in Hawaii I've probably seen a dozen of deaths because they either don't duck dive and get slammed from the peak down towards the sand or worse, rocks and reef. Another reason people die is that they stand at the bottom of the peak and get slammed with pounds of water causing back injuries or worse paralysis. It is fun to bodyboard or bodysurf these types of waves, however do it at your own risk. Learn to duck dive, never be afraid of a wave again.YEEZY YEEZY WHAT'S GOODI made this video piece about Clark a couple years ago, if anyone's interested in knowing a little more.

Here in sweden it's called a 'rotvälta', and you NEVER know when a fallen tree decides to snap/break and swing the stump with all it's roots back up to the original place.

Volcanos, you crazy. Unedited? I can tell you with full confidence as a photographer/photo editor that the color saturation on the aid workers was increased and the rest decreased to add a more dramatic effect. You can even see little bits of brown around the photo that were left to make it seem unedited but seem oddly out of place. Examples are the headless statue and surrounding area, materiel hanging out the window, little spot of brown on the far right down slope.

Fox did something similar.I was taking my dog for a walk the other day, and this is his first full summer so he really hasn't seen fireflies I don't think.

This glaring error upsets me more than it should. My car wouldn't start. So I took it to my Ford dealership because I had 150$ credit. They said it was my battery. I paid 100$ for it because it had a long ass warranty and I was like fuck it. Next day it didn't start again. They said it was my alternator and it would cost 700$. I told them that is insane and hung up. They called back and said they talked to their manager and took 5% off. I laughed and hung up.

I installed the alternator myself for total of 120$ and 30Min to an hour of work. This being my first time looking at youtube videos.

Turns out that wasn't it.

I took it to a mom and pop shop and they fixed it in 4ish hours (dropped it off before work)for 100$ total and said the air condition was drawing power.

The Ford dealership makes money on commission. My theory was they were going to claim it was the alternator and charge me 200-300% overcharge and then fix the air conditioning problem and claim it was the alternator.

Fuck those crooks.Not bad. At the dealership I get my car serviced at they tried to hit me up for $1,900 in bullshit. All I needed was a 25k mile service. I thought out loud and asked him ""are you fucking serious?"". I could see the terror in his eyes and that's worth more than any gift card.Now come get your air filter so we can sell you something else and charge you up on labor to make up for the gift cards.Wow!

http://imgur.com/PLdA307Brooklyn Supreme is NOT the world's biggest horse!

The ""biggest"" horse on record is Sampson, a Shire horse 21.2 hands high by the time he was a four year old, when he was re-named Mammoth. His peak weight was estimated at 3,360 lb.  He was born in 1846, before Brooklyn was ever born.

Brooklyn ""only"" stood 19.2 hands high.  

The record-holder for ""biggest horse"" as of 2007 was a Shire horse named Tina who was 20 hands high.  Tina died in 2008 and was subsequently beaten by Big Jake, who is 20 hands *plus two and three-quarter inches* and still alive, holding the current record.  Big Jake weighs only 2,600 pounds compared to Sampson, but Guinness no longer records ""biggest"" by weight, but by height, so although Jake is much trimmer than either Brooklyn or Sampson, he still holds the title.

Edit: a ""hand"" is 4 inches.
That horse never skipped leg day. Or any day.Beautiful horse, horrible feet. His toe is so long, Id imagine he had a hard time moving especially considering his massive size. Imagine trying to walk with swimming flippers on your feet all day long!When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

That thing is like 200km long.[This article](http://www.weather.com/news/news/chile-calbuco-volcano-eruption-evacuations-alerts) on the Weather Channel has more pictures and info. 

-first eruption in 42 years (1972)
-1500 people evacuated from nearby Ensenada
-it is considered a ""sparsely populated area""
-it is not the only volcano currently spewing hell vomit in Chile at the moment

Best of luck to those nearby!
A few questions,

-What are people supposed to do when you live this close to an active volcano? 

-Does the media play a positive or negative part when something like this happens?

-Can lava melt steel beams?Anyone want a quick volcanology lesson? Heres how this type of eruption works. Inside the mountain is a magma chamber, filled with liquid magma under pressure. In this magma are gasses dissolved inside it. Think of it like a bottle of soda, when you look at the liquid, it's just liquid; but when you release the pressure, the gasses come out and bubble up out the liquid. Same principle in this type of volcano. When the pressure gets too high in the chamber an eruption begins and the gasses in the magma are released out of the magma just like in the soda bottle. But the gasses also bring with it some magma that is quickly solidified into particles as the gas escapes, this is the volcanic ash. So the huge cloud you see is a combination of volcanic gasses and particulate magma known as ash, and at very high temperatures non the less. As the pressure in the magma chamber comes down the eruption slows down, and when the pressure has been relieved the eruption ends. Not a volcanologist, so this info is my synthesis of a complicated process from when I wanted to learn how this worked one day, and is a very basic explanation. [here is a time lapse Video of the erupting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljrDn3Gel4M)[deleted]Calbuco is the name of the volcano. That picture is the view from Puerto Montt.This image is both amazing an scary. Stay safe.[Oooh @_@](http://i.imgur.com/awyhPkT.gif)Earth here, happy fucking Earth day. Best photo I've seen today.

Little bit about the photo.   I live in the remote fly in community called Pangnirtung in Canada's High Arctic. 
Between sunrise and sunset we have only 2 .5 hours of light. (Not all usable). around 1pm a jumped on my skidoo along with my friend Markus and we drove 45min up to the top of a nearby mountain where the light ( which is almost always pink near the solstice ) would hit the hills. Prepared with multiple thermos filled with tea we began tossing the water and shooting. Nothing of this shot was to chance i followed the temperature, i watched for calm wind,  planned the shot and set it up. even the sun in the middle of the spray was something i was hoping for (even though its was impossible to control).

Someone educate me... what are the balloon-looking things?  Or are they bombs?  My Dad is somewhere in there. My grandfather was a medic on D-day. He dragged wounded and dead soldiers to the beach and loaded them onto medic boats. I'm going to see him in an hour and I didn't realize what today is until I saw this post. Thank you for reminding me to thank him. Probably the most insane logistical and engineering undertaking in history.an interesting thing about d day is the germans blew up all the docks and the allies anticipated this and build a floating dock that they could boat up to the beach which then served as a unloading point for all their shit... and the germans blew up their shit and the allies sailed their dock in and everything went way easier for the unloading process... it was called mulberry and when i saw this on the history channel the guy said it was one of the most innovative things about the invasionImagine what that must have *sounded* like.Might get buried, but I'm pretty sure that boat 2nd from the left was my grandfather's ship.  LST 309.  Crazy to think he is in the photo somewhereIn *The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant*, which may be the finest memoirs ever by a U.S. President, Grant devotes many chapters to the Mexican-American War and the U.S. Civil War. This is no surprise. However, to those unfamiliar with the text, it often comes as a surprise how much attention Grant devotes to *logistics*.  In popular imagining, new technologies like machine guns were decisive in the Civil War, but from the point of view of America's top general, such things weren't even worth mentioning. Victory resulted from being able to move his cannons and food to where he wanted them to be.[Meanwhile, back in America](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7493/15944038808_a049f08ec3_h.jpg)[deleted]
""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""

Sir alec guinness

James doohanThis is an incredible and amazing photo.  Reading about the landings and that day and the horror of just the one battle, it's a mind blowing thought to me that as safe as these particular soldiers must have felt, they were just getting started with the war.

I can't comprehend how mentally taxing battle must have been.  If you survive, you know there's more coming.  In Stephen Ambrose's book ""D-Day,"" which I highly recommend, he compares the D-Day landings to taking every man, woman, child, vehicle, and supply in Green Bay, Wisconsin—everything in the entire city not bolted down—and moving it across Lake Michigan in 24 hours while under constant fire.Where are all those metal things that you usually see in movies depicting D-day. I think they're called hedgehogs? I thought they were there to prevent lots of vehicles landing on the beach. ""You know those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got?

It was before the Bears match yesterday[OP right after taking this picture](http://media.giphy.com/media/vJKeu2upniCSk/giphy.gif).Stealth - 11/10 

IGNI *just* finished two hours of reading about the development of the stealth bomber.  TIL:  That a scale model was made with the functional RCS technique and placed atop a $186,000 pole to make it high enough to fire radar at it.  When the radar returned only a blip for the pole, the operator sent guys to put the plane back on top, as it has clearly fallen off.  It had not.  

BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ALL 'MURICA. 

Unsatisfied, apparently, with seeing the blip of the pole...they ordered the design and construction of *a new pole made with stealth capabilities.*  They made an effin stealth *pole.*  No info on how many workers died running into it while setting it up.

Bonus TIL:  1)Stealth bombers were the first planes ever designed by a team lead by the electrical engineer.  2)When designing the shape of the plane, they created software to test for the desired effect on radar systems.  They were unable to even consider panels that were curved, as the the computers running the test algorithms would still be working on the results *today,* which is why they are flat.  This design and the total lack of traditional aerodynamics led to it being nicknamed Hopeless Diamond.  This could have so easily been photo shopped and I wouldn't even be mad if it was.Where was this taken?For all who say they need proof, this is as much as I can do, [the next shot](http://i.imgur.com/RNxF7re.jpg) in the HDR burst.

A box of... premiums.Pretty sure that's Ray Liotta Elvis guy here.

What strikes me is how modest the setting here is.  At this point Elvis was the biggest name in the world, with multiple #1 records and hit movies. He was already a pioneer in music (with several ""first"" concept albums already done) and basically the most famous entertainer in the world.

By 1959, Elvis beloved mama was dead and Vernon had already remarried (a woman who quickly asserted herself as the new matriarch of the family, much to Elvis' displeasure. She and Vernon lived in GRaceland with Elvis for a time but after she rearranged the furniture and changed the drapes, which Gladys had picked out, Elvis moved all her stuff out and sent her down the road to live with Vernon in a nearby house).


It's unclear to me where this picture was taken but it doesn't appear to be Graceland. The house changed a lot between 57-77 but this doesn't look anything I've seen. It may be Vernonshouse.

The point is, despite already having an obscene amount of money and a willingness to spend it freely on his loved ones, the  environment here is still so modest. It's partially because of the era and partially because. Elvis' family grew up so dirt poor that even this was considered a significant step up.Christ he's photogenic isn't he?Her head looks way too small for her body.

Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

>All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hen’s oviduct. The journey through the chicken’s oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg.Wow, it's a very artistic photograph :DCould you possibly post a picture of each hen showing which egg is hers? That would be cool to see.Banjo Kazooie!hen partyI've seen every single one of those from my mother's hens.

I was frustrated at first until he looks up at me and says ""I've been saving my allowance and helping neighbors all year to buy this."" The mother gave me this really apologetic look and says he insisted he pay for it with the money he earned. Was just too cute for me to be angry.As a previous employee of Best Buy, I'm familiar with this type of customer, and there's one thing I can promise you: he complained about how long it took to check out.As a jew this is a little awkwardDont know about the States but in Canada you can refuse payment like that. Anything more than 27 coins I believe.That's a lot of broken parking metersthe guy couldn't have gone to a bank beforehand to exchange the quarters for cash??? what a prick. poor craig robinson...This is what those of us who have cashiered refer to as ""The Baggy"".

The customer approaches you with their purchase(es), perhaps wearing a slight smile and greeting you kindly. You ring up their items, exchanging in some well-worn small talk that you have used over and over again for the past few hours. When you inform the customer of their total, the customer suddenly says, ""I hope you don't mind change.""

And there it is. Before then it had only been heard of in legend, mentioned in the tales of other more seasoned cashiers that have seen every horror of the job. You had scoffed at it then--how badly could a baggy be, after all? But then you see it yourself, unable to help yourself from cringing at the sound of the weight of coinage being dropped upon your counter. You look from The Baggy to the total, and then to the line of customers gathering behind The Baggy Holder.

You realize that you cannot be defeated. Not by this. Certainly not by a pile of coins and the piece of plastic that contains them. You must endure so that one day you are able to tell this tale in hopes to warn another unfortunate soul about the existance of The Baggy.

You open The Baggy with trembling hands and begin the count...the stereotype lives on.Used to work at a movie theater.  Teens would come in and ask to see an R rated movie they were clearly not old enough to see and dump a bag of pennies on my counter and giggle.  So I'd count them.  Slowly.  Purposefully.  They'd begin to get impatient (2 minutes before the movie, hurry up!)  Then I'd ""lose"" count.  Gotta start again.  Finally they would just stand there and fume.  I'd finish, let them know they had enough, then ask for ID.  None of them even bothered to try to bring a fake one.  Booted them out.

Give me pennies, prepare to wait mofo's.The guy counting the quarters is probably thinking *""what the fuck am I doing with my life""*he should have paid with the gold he keeps hidden in a bag around his neck.As a person who works in retail, fuck people like this. This has happened so many times at my store that my manager has told me I don't have to accept large payments that are made with change. Seriously is it so hard to go to the bank and get bills?That is a total dick move. I get if you are proud that you saved up enough quarters to buy an iPod, but stop by the fucking bank first and cash that shit in. Don't make the poor sales guy deal with that shit. Illegal to do that in Canada. You're only allowed to use quarters for purchases up to $10.

** (2) A payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:
(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and

[Source](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/page-1.html#s-8.)What a douche bag. When I was a bank teller a common customer came in with fucking $600 of unsorted change. I tried to explain to him that a branch just 2 miles away had a change sorting machine but we didn't. 

I was also the only teller working for that 2 hours, which is about how long it took me. He also told me that he had counted and I was off by $30. 

I almost quit right there. ... He actually looks like the kind of guy who owns a small, yet successful, chain of laundromats and a handful of vending machines.

Of course, that same look applies to a great number of private investigators as well.  They just usually don't have the quarters like this guy does.

(Polo shirt, not quite physically fit, constantly on phone or internet so as to keep things moving in the business).This guy is being a jerk. He's a grown ass man who could easily go to bank to get his coins counted up and pay with bills.  And yet here he is on his smart phone wasting his and everyone's time.Why did he have to be wearing a kippah? We've come so far. And now we're back at square one.

Oy vey.I know this is never going to get read, but all comments regarding the Jewish stereotype and poor retail worker aside this really reflects poorly on the management.  If I was a supervisor at this Best Buy and I saw this going on I would have pulled this man aside and counted the quarters myself, in an office, while I would have my cashier service other customers.  Just because you have an inconsiderate customer doesn't mean that you should let your other customers and your employees suffer.  Simply tell them ""We are not a bank""and the best buy guy should have taken the extra few minutes and sifted through the  quarters for silver. there was no doubt probably 15-30 silver quarters. tell your boss you need change and swap out a $20 for the silver quarters. would have made the counting of  quarters worth it.While I was in college, a grad student across the hall from me saved up his change from the time he was like 12.  

He bought a 56"" flatscreen with it.  About $2000, all in a giant crayon that weighed probably 200 lbs.  

The Best Buy crew had to count it out at customer service.  Took about three hours.When I was a Supervisor at Best Buy I'd happily go grab the change counter from Ops room and use it count that shit.

Those types of customer are either looking for an argument or think that putting some minimum wage high school kid through the wringer is *fun*. Taking away their fun is the only way to win.Assuming he bought a 16 GB iPad Mini at $329, with tax comes out to roughly $350. This is about 1400 quarters. If the cashier counted the quarters for 15 minutes, he counted about 93 quarters every minute, which is 3 quarters every 2 seconds.

If anyone wants to see the rest of the pictures of this National Geographic story shot by Wayne Lawrence.I used to live in Flint, and these are the most well-dressed kids I've ever seen in this town. Private school? 
As a quick aside, I'm begging you all not to forget about Flint. This town has been getting screwed for decades, and people are finally paying attention. Keep pressing the issue, because the people responsible for this need to be held accountable. No slaps on the wrist this time. ""Back in 2016 I had to carry bottled water 5 miles uphill in the snow!""As shitty as the situation is little man looks sharp in the uniform.Fun story. I lived in Detroit for a summer in a house with no pipes and no electricity. It had been completely gutted. So no water, no working toilets, etc. It was pretty crazy but I grew up poor so it didn't feel as bad to me as it would for other people.

Background: my dad bought this house for hella cheap and moved out there. He knew what he was getting himself into and had plans to just rough it while he saved up to have the pipes re-installed, toilets and sinks and faucets replaced and get everything in working order. That never happened though. Life throws curve balls at us all the time. 

The summer of 2010, I went to stay with him since it was summer vacation from college. 

There was a lot of craftiness involved in living there. Being on my period was the worst. 

My brother (also lived there) and I would walk to the local library and brush our teeth there. We would stay from open until about 3 or 4pm and read and charge our phones. We were also able to use flushing toilets there. At home, we shat in plastic bags and then threw them away outside (tmi?) 

We were also able to get gallons of water at the store to bathe with. We would put water in little tin things (like for cooking bbq and stuff) and then use bar soap. We weren't the cleanest people but we weren't hella funky either.

My dad did splurge once when I was on my period and got me a room in a hotel so I could clean up properly. I was also able to wash my hair at the hotel which was nice. 

We didn't have electricity either. My dad and I slept on the floor in his room (brother was upstairs) and one day we went to RadioShack and bought a crank radio. We would listen to our favorite radio show at night. It was really nice. The sun set pretty late so we had a good amount of daylight to get stuff done. Whenever I would get home from the library, I would usually write or draw.

We ate a lot of fruit and bread and random snacks because we couldn't cook. My dad and brother also ate canned meats. 

It was a summer I'll never forget. It was actually one of my favorite summers in spite of everything. I knew that when I went back to school, I was going to miss Detroit. It's not the friendliest city in the world but for some reason the part I was in (the east side) felt kind of like the country to me. Things felt slower, homier, more neighbohood-y. It's hard to explain. But as much shit as people have to say about Detroit, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Most people don't know I've lived like this and wouldn't expect it. I'm kind of prim and proper at times and I'm about to get a master's degree. People with master's degrees don't shit in plastic bags!Gm refused to use it because it was corroding car parts...people expect flint residents to bathe in it?

Hhmm make it black and white and we are back to 1940 Maybe this is why we think old pictures looks so different. Because these are the photos that make it to the future. People in 2060 are going to think the same thing we're thinking now!Is this for showers, dish washing etc. as well?Stop commenting how much water that is for drinking. 

You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. That's a quarter bottle, per person, at least. You make your coffee. Two bottles. You drink it and wash your cup. That's at least a bottle of water to do that. Of course if you ate breakfast and your family ate too, you have to wash those, so bet on 10 bottles to do your dishes. You can take a shower, but the water is sort of blue today, which means the copper hasn't cleared the lines, and you broke out yesterday, so you just wipe up with a washrag. That's half a bottle. Per person. Minimum. If you need to wash your hair, that's an an additional 2-5 bottles, if you have long hair. 

You need to wipe down the counters, but you don't want to wipe lead onto them, so you use bottled water to clean up with, that's a bottle or 2. You water the dog, 2 bottles. THroughout all this, you've probably been sipping on a water bottle. 

You make spaghetti for dinner, that means 4 bottles for water for cooking, plus 10-12 bottles to wash out that many greasy pots and pans and rinse them, and you still have to wash everyone up for bed and get their teeth brushed, which is at least another three quarters of a bottle per person. 

Stop thinking of it as the drinking water allowance for the day. It's the only clean, safe, usable water in your home that can be used for anything but flushing your toilet, for the next 24 hours. Is that just *their* allowance or for the whole family? And wouldn't it be more efficient to distribute the water in gallon jugs?[Source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160209-flint-michigan-portraits-photography-lead/)please credit the god damn photographer.

Pardon my language and this isn't meant personally toward anyone but as someone from Flint, MI I say this:  Fuck off with using us as ""the state of America"" and all that.  Every 10 years we end up in the news for some ""look how the system has failed"" story and every time people act like they finally realize something needs to change.  None of you care in the bigger picture of it all.  A year or more down the road and you will have forgotten all about this and Flint will still be decayed and run down and left a shell of a city.  As shitty as this current situation is, it's been within a hair of this for DECADES.  This is just an interesting headline to the rest of the nation until it isn't any more.I apologize if this is not the appropriate place to post this, but I feel it may be useful since it's a highly visible post right now.

We are a band from Flint, MI (I currently live right downtown) called Sprowt.

Several bands, some from Flint and some outside of Flint, have contributed music to a $5 compilation album organized by Jonathan Diener (of The Swellers). 

100% of the proceeds are being donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint's Flint Child Health & Development Fund (flintkids.org).

If you're a music fan, please feel free to donate by buying the Not Safe To Drink: Music For Flint Water Crisis Relief compilation album at:

https://notsafetodrink.bandcamp.com/

The compilation album will be available on February 20th, 2016.

Thank you to everyone taking notice and doing something to help.

Put quite frankly, this whole thing sucks.Where can I donate?I can't imagine what I'd do if my kids had been permanently poisoned with lead. I'd go on a rampage.Flint is a disaster.  There's literally no quick fix and one that won't cost a huge amount of money.  Flint needs to be condemned and the residents should have their homes bought out at a fair market price before the crisis occurred.  100,000 residents + a quick google search showing that the average house price ~$100k = $10bn to buy out Flint. Probably a bit more than that, but in the ball park.  Shit, we spend way more to drop bombs on people in foreign lands every year.  I'm sure we can help 100,000 Americans out.

Also, more info on [Lichtenberg figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure)! This may sound obvious, but if you see something like that happening, don't go near it. There's other people in this thread who said that, but I'm not sure if everyone knows the reason why. It's not just because the person telling you to stay away thinks you're stupid and going to accidentally touch the line. Being near the line can kill you, you don't have to actually touch the line to die. 

An energized wire on the ground causes something called ""step potential"". Basically, the voltage in the ground is high near the wire, and decreases the farther away from the wire you get. If your feet are apart, the voltage between your feet can cause a current to travel through your body. Maybe it'll injure you, maybe it'll kill you. If you need to get away from something like this, shuffle away with your feet together. They used to tell us you could also hop with your feet together, but I guess they don't trust us not fall over, because that would also probably kill you. 

tl;dr: Just being near a burning wire like this can kill you, even without actually touching it.[Who wants a body massage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3GTNv9hHk)It's the Sha from WoW! Except real!I have had the experience of watching a high voltage line fall to the ground and arc several times after a rain storm. I was about 200' away when it fell. The sound, heat, and brilliant light was truly a thing to behold. The sound is a tortured and macabre screed in the most evil tone you've ever heard. The heat and light are incredibly intense. Unfortunately the sound drew my eyes directly to the fireball and it left an after image the persisted for several minutes. 

These underground vault fires are something special too. I have watched an attempt to put these out before. As I recall, it took this massive truck pumping insane quantities of CO2 into the vault to chill it before anyone could enter. 

http://youtu.be/0_jLmAB3leAReal Question: Shouldn't this wire be insulated?ShockingFractals. Crazy how they pop up over and over.Lineman here, can confirm, stay away. People,  voltage won't kill you, amperage will. The resistance of the ground changes everywhere, that's the reason for the lighting bolt pattern. What's cool is that along where the wire was on the ground (directly beneath the wire) it'll make crude glass, which looks pretty bad ass. 
Safety: NEVER touch a down wire. We are protected by step/touch potential by rubber over shoes gloves and sleeves, even then we still verify that the wire is de-energized before we touch it. Keep in mind de-energized does not mean that it's safe to touch. Had a worker bump a line with his leg that was down and de-energized but not properly grounded, didn't have his boots on because they were In a marsh and he got killed. Induced voltage from another line. If a wire is on the ground think of it as a bear or wolf, you get to close and it's going to maim and more often than not kill you... 

TL/DR: Never touch a wire on the ground, fear that shit like it's got a gun to your head. That's fracted up.Sha-touched groundA similar pattern grew on a CD I left in my car for over a year:

What are we talking- $40 each?  $50 maybe?The sanding...oh god, the sanding...TIL: *Brown Oak is technically not a distinct species of oak, but rather refers to oak (almost always English Oak or another European species) that has been infected with a fungus. This fungus (Fistulina hepatica) has the effect of turning the wood a deep brown color. Once the wood has been cut and dried, the fungus dies, leaving a rich golden brown lumber.*

English Oak (assuming that's what this is) looks to have tighter grain than the Red Oak I'm used to in Virginia.That's awesome.  What's to keep it from drying out and cracking in half 5 years from now?GnarlyThat is a seat fit for an Archdruid[carved from a single piece of wood](http://i.imgur.com/79dvfII.png)Such a perfect stump,

for [Little Rubio!](http://i.imgur.com/dVD7yiu.png)Stunning work of art, it belongs in a museum.  What a gifted craftsman.It's beautiful but somehow repulsive.The craftsman that made this chair was 78 years old. It was the last piece of furniture his boss Tom told him to make. It took him a year and a half to complete.

 As he worked his hands hurt and he felt tired. At times he wanted to cut corners and go home early. But did he? No, he worked harder and more diligently than ever. The sweat boiled from his face as he toiled. Final he was done.

 He showed the chair to his boss the next morning. ""Jim this is the finest work you have ever done."" His boss was very pleased. ""Why did you work on it so hard Jim?""

 ""Because the customer who buys this will live with it for a lifetime."" ""Through good times and bad, through all the seasons and all Hollidays. Memories will be made. Memories maybe I didn't get to make myself."" 

Tom looks at Jim and with a tear in his eye and says ""The chair is yours Jim."" ""The chair is yours Jim....."" ""It didn't take that long, considering I carved all by hand and from a single piece of wood.""That is a lot of work on a very unstable piece of wood. I hope it's kept in a very stable environment.I suppose everyone has different tastes, but this is butt ugly to me.  Tremendous amount of work and considerable skill displayed, but not something I'd have.The sanding...oh god, the sanding...Ron Swanson would be proud... though he could have done that in one evening after drinking a pint of whiskey.TRUMP 2016!!!

Please downvote me!!!Sorry but it reminds me of the nails of the guy who holds the guiness world record for the longest nails.That's glorious!  Thank you for sharing!I was also carved from an oak stump. Excellent showcase of skill.I once made a pinewood derby car.

From a kit.Gorgeous work. Thanks for sharing. I don't know why some are so worried about how big or comfortable it would be.

So many memories going up there each summer.I wonder how many people were conceived there.I find it interesting that the only place the forest made inroads is right up by the screen.  My guess is that the fanned out area where cars used to park to see the movie is somewhat contaminated from oil and exhaust from cars, making that ground less fertile.  In fact, I see that bushes are growing in the car-park area, but in distinct lines, probably where cars didn't park or drive.

Edit: tried to leave him in my backyard when he was walking again, no squirrel adopted him but now the squirrels in the neighborhood will come up to my porch and take nuts out of my hand.

Please don't tell me you're charging people for photography of this quality. If you are just mucking around and taking photos for friends, that's fine (and I hope you're enjoying yourself!). But you should not be allowing people to put faith in you (and give you probably large sums of money) to document what might be the biggest event in their life when you are clearly not qualified to perform this work.

If you can look past the god-awful quality/sharpness/resolution of the image (are you using consumer gear or a point and shoot?) and even further past the basic compositional errors (have you ever studied any other wedding photography before?) the photos still don't appear to have any of effort put into colour correction, cropping, lens issue correction, or any other kind of post production.

You should be less concerned about slipping in ""clever"" reflections, and actually focus on learning how to use a camera. You are far, far from the point where you should be watermarking your images and calling yourself a professional.

What happens if the water level rose/dropped say 5-10 feet? I don't know about this area but around here thats pretty common throughout the year. Does the house float up to compensate? Is nothing kept on the lower level with the dock and they just let that flood? What if it rises over that level? Just curious if anyone knows.I work in this area often.

Americans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.  But I think in many cases a revolution just replaces the current bad players with a possible set of worse players.

CEDAR FALLS (KWWL) -
The University of Northern Iowa Police Department are asking for your help for information regarding the whereabouts of Adam Sailor.

>Sailor was expected to participate in commencement ceremonies today but failed to attend.

>He is around 5’ 9” tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

>If you have information regarding Sailor or where he is located please call UNI Police Department immediately. 

>UNI Police Department: 319-273-2712Wait why was she flying in? Graduation is only a few days after finalsThanks for David Johnson!Fellow native Iowan here, glad to see my home state on the front page for some reason other than the primaries...This is why you can't say *all* of the education system in America is bad.ITT: Iowans getting stoked about finding other Iowans on Reddit.

Note: I too am from Iowa. I've been in the UNIdome many times. 
UNI is great - I just finished up my first year, and I love it. From the administration to students, it feels very tight-knit. I have the opportunity to work with administrators, and they genuinely care about students. Once in a while the president (Bill Ruud, at the left podium) will just wander around the union and talk to people, he invited student government to his house. A couple weeks ago the Provost (Jim Wohlpart, on the right podium) came to one of the student senate meetings, and we had a great discussion with him. 

And he signs his emails with an interesting signature, ""Awe & Wonder"".
Honestly that really considerate of them.

At my graduation the women's lacrosse team was away at some championship game and came two hours late, and the faculty tried to make everyone stay. People were getting restless and tried to leave but they would get up and tell the students that it was mandatory to stay. 

Eventually they got there, instead of lining up and getting their diplomas they wanted their names called one by one so they could make a grand entrance and high-five people. They got booed instantly.Is the ceremony so important? I mean... I'm in Europe, but when my graduation ceremony was organized I had already moved to another city and started working, so I just declined the invitation. 

It's just an event, as far as I know :3Was surprised seeing UNI on Reddit... I completed my Master's there. I never thought I'd end up in Iowa, but can't think of a bad thing to say about UNI or Cedar Falls.

They also aren't exactly cheap, I work in trucking and lots of places that do 'pallet exchange' charge upwards of $5 a pallet, you could probably afford a couple 2x4s for that amount of money.

Reminds me of an unrelated joke about airplanes!

**A** small two-seater Cessna 152 plane crashed into a cemetery early this afternoon.

Search and rescue workers have found two survivors and recovered 300 bodies so far and expect that number to climb as digging continues into the evening.I saw one in person and it literally unsettled me.  It's very very strange looking at it closely; it's like your sense of vision goes a little bit wonky and your point of focus kind of slips and slides off the lines of the fuselage leaving with you a sense that it's unnatural and that even after having examined it closely you're still not sure of its shape, like it wasn't designed by humans.

It was much more advanced than reasonably possible in the 60's, heck, it still is 50 years later and I say that it's the sexiest machine ever built.

EDIT: Didn't intend to insinuate aliens.  Go watch a proper documentary, ya bunch o' loonies!An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.

""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

If you enjoyed that story, check out the subreddit dedicated to the Blackbird: /r/SR71I use to live in Mildenhall, U.K. for all of my childhood life.  Seeing these taking off and landing was amazing.  I use to bunk off school to go down the landing lights to watch these fly out. The air shows they had every year allowed you to get up close and talk to the pilots.  Stunning planes! Definite highlight for me at the museum of flight in SeattleYou can view one of these lovely planes at Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.My husband and I were crew chiefs on the KC-135Q model at Beale AFB.  One night we got the call, grabed our mobility bags and headed for the flightline.  We ended up flying to Florida, landing and refueling, took back off and when we got to altitude we called down to Control in Florida, who then placed a call to California to tell them that we were at altitude over Florida.  Then and only then, did the SR take off in California so that we could refuel them over Florida.   That is fast!  When your refuel plane has to be in the air and ready all the way across the country before you can even take off.  The 135 had to go full throttle during the refuel, that think shook so bad one would think that it was going to shake apart.  Crew chiefs were allowed to lay in the boom pod with the boomer during the refuel.  It was awesome!""WHYYYYYYYY?!....WHY YOU AL-WAYS KICK ME WHEN III'M....HIIIIIGGGGHHHHH?!""Airplane?  This shit was designed to haunt dreams.  Not carry passengers.Should out to evergreen aviation museum, it has one partially opened sr71, the spruce goose, and a myriad of other cool fighters, jet liners, and even a free tanks. Just outside Mcminnville, OregonI've always wondered what replaced the SR-71's role in the modern day air force.X-Jet?http://imgur.com/aETYDXBA few random items. All planes get metal fatigue with microscopic cracks, that over a lifetime, will eventually ground the airframe. The SR-71 was composed of titanium and heated up so much during its flights, that the plane would stretch about a foot in length and the heat would soften the metal so much that it would fill in the cracks. The airframe was basically reforged every flight. It also got more and more fuel efficient the faster it flew. The only limitation on its top speed was the engine cones would melt after Mach 3.7 or so. The A-12 flew slightly higher and slightly faster because it was lighter with only having 1 person on board and 1 bay for reconnaissance as opposed to the SR-71's 3 bays for reconnaissance.

Also, Wright Patterson is the world's oldest and largest aviation museum. They are moving the presidential and experimental planes to the main campus next spring so you will no longer have to take a shuttle bus or miss those exhibits if and when you visit.You might like [this](http://www.nmusafvirtualtour.com/media/068/SR-71A%20Front%20Cockpit.html) a 3d view of the cockpit.

Also, find a copy of Sled Driver on pdf by Brian Schul. Well worth the read.""The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. An advanced long range strategic reconnaissance aircraft capable of mach 3 and an altitude of 85,000 feet.""

""You sure do know a lot about it..""

""DO YOU EVEN READ MY CHRISTMAS LIST?""Go to RAF Duxford, you can reach over ropes and touch one. If anyone is interested in learning more about the SR-71 and a couple of very Top Secret aircraft, at the time, I would suggest reading the book *Skunk Works* it is a great read.


Fun fact, every second that this plane was flying at Mach 3 the engines took in the same amount of air as 2 *million* people breathing in at the same time.From **Sled Driver: Flying The World's Fastest Jet** - There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""

Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""

And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now.

It's odd when you stumble across a place you recognize IRL on reddit. 
I'm friends with your neighbor and have seen that view many times.

 I was wondering who bought that place. Great job on the renovation!Did a girl move in?So is there an Eames chair hiding behind the Eames footrest?That is one amazing maximization of living space. Way to open it up. Looks fantastic.Love the stairs. Where did you get them?

My guess is that your local building code won't accept the open nature of the stairs on one side -- because of the possibility of falls.Some Feeney cable rail would look great on those stairs for the right side handrail. http://www.feeneyinc.com/
Not the cheapest but really nice. I like everything but the new couch. The old one looks so damn comfyWhat's upstairs? It's like...you became an adult. Nice! Do anything professionally or is this from YouTube learning?Went from a cool place to hang out at to a place you have to hold your farts in for long uncomfortable periods of time.Replacing that stair case was money well spent. I feel like the right wall needs to be red or some other accent color. Great renovation.What an incredible transformation! What part do you like best about your new place? Also, what kind of set up do you have? A studio? Or is it something more?Thats a pretty neat carpet design whered you find it?You people are crazy, or all in on a joke or something. 

Dirty carpet, ugly furniture, old ugly kitchen cabinets, cramped kitchen, all fixed and improved. Very good job, OP.I love the new stairs.  It really opened up the space.I'm surprised by how many people prefer the before. The only thing that I would see as a downgrade is the couch. On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Even though I'm only in my early-30s, plenty of Redditors are younger than that. The before reminds me of my first apartment, the second reminds me of what I upgraded into. So well done OP, welcome to adult-hood. Young redditors, you'll be there soon.

* The stairs, way less of a visual strain.
* I'll take hardwood over carpet, every day of the fucking week.
* Opening up the kitchen pass-through into the dining-area is great.
* Using ceiling mounted lighting over the dining area table instead of a floor mounted is great as well. 
* That arcade took up too much space for the area (IMO), good job placing it elsewhere. 
* Many other improvementsLooks great. I like how you swapped out the laminate for some foot friendly carpet. The gaming arcade and well stocked central bar are also nice touches! Very 80's.It is amazing

what throwing out old beer cans

can do for value.Based on the lighting, I'd say there's a window behind where the picture was taken.

It makes those binoculars on the table seem a little bit creepy.I can totally picture myself falling off those stairs... face first.

This fucking guy layed down in the patchiest, dirtiest piece of land and pinned us down. 4 of us could not find him. We KNEW here was there because the goddamn grass kept shooting at us. But we couldn't figure out which patch of grass it was, or what part of that patch was him.

He didn't want us messing with it, but every now and then when he was away, I'd sneak it down from the attic and play spy. I did this all through middle school, hiding in bushes and fields, trying to see how close I could get to people without them noticing.

One time I was trying to sneak up on a small herd of deer that were hanging around in a field by the highway. I got really close, when suddenly this car pulls over, and the driver gets out. He slammed his door, which scared the deer away. :(

He also apparently pulled over to take a leak, and thought the small grassy outcropping was a good target to piss on. I was a good spy. I never compromised my position.I completely missed the other two snipers in the background.This reminds me of a time I had a sleepover with a friend who insisted to stay the night.  We stayed up late playing call of duty 4 and he kept getting frustrated saying ""I fucking hate wookies.  I don't want to play Star Wars.""   

He was complaining about the snipers in their ghillies and also refrained from telling me that prior to our sleepover, he had ingested quite a bit of hallucinogens.

The idea is that without putting human lives at risk, sheep can detonate landmines over time while the owner of the sheep is compensated for the possibility of losing said sheepIt is absolutely mind boggling the scales of WW1 and WW2. I have traveled around much of Europe and South East Asia, retracing troop movements and big battles. Some of the places seem like it just took place in the past decade. The sheer size of these wars are just simply unimaginable. Reminds me of the final episode of Blackadder :'-(That is beautiful, but also quite eye opening.  I imagine you could spend an afternoon digging around in there, and you are pretty much guaranteed to find some soil.Ah yes, the trenches of Beaumont-Hamel. The 1st Royal Newfoundland Regiment's probably more well known battles. July 1st, 9:15am, of the 780 men, all from the 1RNR involved in the 3rd wave of attacks (all attacks before completely failed), only 110 survived, and only 68 were available for roll call next morning. This picture is just East of the Caribou Memorial for the 1RNR. By the looks of the craters this was a German trench because a week before the charge, the Allies bombarded the German line with artillery and mortar. Unfortunately it did not weaken their defenses.[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont-Hamel_Newfoundland_Memorial) is the story of this trench.Some scars never heal completely[deleted]Were the trenches originally straight and they have eroded over time, or were they dug like that? If the landmines are all gone, that would be one hell of a playground.Considering the fronts weren't moving much and it was essentially feeding meat into a grinder from both sides ... just imagine how many people died in that picture alone over those 4 years. :/[Welcome to the lovely Cercen Pass.]  (http://i.imgur.com/mLSXLBt.jpg)  Where you can still find many remnants of the oft-forgotten Frozen War of the Alps.

The Austria efforts were equally Sisyphean.  [On Marmolada, the highest mountain in the Dolomites,](http://i.imgur.com/n88KSic.jpg) the Austrian Corps of Engineers built an entire ""ice city""—a complex of tunnels, dormitories, and [storerooms dug out of the bowels of the glacier.](http://i.imgur.com/Iu2H7gM.jpg)  Only to lose it to the Italians.  Who in turn lost it the next winter to the combined Austrian/German forces.  In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

.

We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie

In Flanders fields.


.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.Imagine if the Grand Canyon was originally a trench for giantsAnd every hole is where an artillery shell hit, its really astonishing to look at Verdun and other sections of north-eastern France and Belgium.

Fun fact, their still digging up undetonated land mines, shells and grenades from that area (The red zone i think its called) so about 102 years of cleaning.Australians died there. Motherfucking Australians from the other side of the damn world. This might be a good time to mention The Great War on YouTube is covering WW1 week by week as it was 100 years ago with added bonus videos.

And no I don't work for them it's really that good.There's a BBC documentary called ""The First World War From Above""  that's currently on US Netflix (and, apparently, [also on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8C_CIdmk8)) that does a great job of exploring the scars that the trenches and battles of WWI left on Europe. Well worth a watch.to put the First world war into perspective, there is a 1 foot thick layer of iron stained soil which stretches across parts of France and Belgium which is entirely composed of shrapnel and debris from the war. 

the trenches, shell craters and structures may erode away, but the layer of war will remain for millennia below the surface. Pictures from WWI continue to amaze me and instill a sense of humbleness and pride (being Canadian, and all). I have been fortunate enough to visit Vimy Ridge and the surrounding area twice. The first time the monument was being restored, so thankfully I was able to go again a couple years ago. It was a great experience, and I highly suggest anyone go if you get the chance. From what I remember, the tours at Vimy Ridge are free; you just sign up for a time when you get there. I also suggest renting a car and just driving all over. You will stumble upon many different WWI and WWII sites that are must-sees. Can't wait to go back!

Even though this will be buried, if anyone is interested in seeing pictures, feel free to ask.There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools, singing at night,

And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,

Would scarcely know that we were gone.

- Sara TeasdaleWell how do you do now, you Willie MacBride?
Do you mind if I sit down beside your graveside
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun?
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done 

Well I see by your gravestone you was only nineteen
When you joined the great fallen of nineteen sixteen
Well I hope you died well and I hope you died clean
Or Willie MacBride was it low and obscene? 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Did you leave a young wife or a sweetheart behind?
In some faithful heart are your memories enshrined?
For although you died back in nineteen sixteen
In that faithful heart you're forever nineteen 

Or are you a stranger without even a name
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane
In an old photograph tor, battered and stained
Faded to yellow with brown leather frayed?


Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

As the sun beats down on the green fields of France
There's a soft summer breeze makes the red poppies dance
And see how the sun shines from under the clouds
There's no gas, there's no barbed wire, no guns firing now 

Oh but here in this grave yard it's still no man's land
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
And through man's blind indifference to his fellow man
To a whole generation who were butchered and damned 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Now Willie MacBride, I can't help wonder why
All those that lie here now why did they die?
And did they believe when they answered the call
Did they really believe tat this war could end wars? 

Oh the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain
The killing and dying, 'twas all done in vain
For, Willie MacBride, oh it happened again
And again and again and again and again 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest?

I ""technically"" helped build it by putting in the point of sale workstations throughout the ship (there are literally over 300 POS terminals on that ship).  I had an AWESOME outside cabin, and made the crossing from Turku to Miami.  I hooked up with a nice voluptuous girl from Wales (great body, bad teeth) and got very drunk very often.  We even had a kickass Halloween for all the contractors.

But after seeing how the crew lives, there's no way in hell I'd live on that thing.  Three months was more than enough time for it to get old, even with all the amenities.  That being said, the food was amazing, the shows were amazing, the Steiners were amazing (those are the insanely hot ""spa chicks"") and the bars (there are 17 on the ship) were kickass.  We tested them all (luxury of being a POS guy).

RCCL is a great company.  They're NOTHING like Carnival. Can't wait to see Titanic II make her trip from Southampton to New York in 2016. Best of Luck to Mr. Palmer, Hope it all goes off without a hitch, I'll see you in NY.It is the twin of Oasis of the Seas. Both same size... largest cruise ships in world.

Torille![I got my eye on you...](http://imgur.com/Vrj6NEW)TOOT, TOOT MOTHERFUCKER!That... that is a big ship.but...the bridge?Took a cruise on this beast two years ago. I felt like i was on the Enterprise. Very nice. Alright, guys.  For real this time.  This boat is unsinkable.  Creepy. The size difference is always impressive, but those ocean liners from 1900-40 or so were just so damn sleek and beautiful. Cruise ships are just so ugly by comparison. 

I miss me some genuine ocean liners.But the real question  is how did they conquer that bridge?I have a sudden, new respect for the Titanic now.how big would a wave have to be in order to tip this thing? would it ever be in any danger to this type of event?

with that being said, looks like a ton of fun to be on.The Titanic wouldn't have sunk if it rammed the iceberg head on.Now we need a bigger iceberg.","[0.536426, 0.066419, 0.289572, 0.158409, 0.038848, 0.0, 0.0, 0.079, 0.259, 0.159, 0.563, 0.619, 0.813]"

He was actually really chill, loved to sit on the back of their couch and sun himself.. until one day in February when I walked into their house wearing my favorite red toque with a huge pom-pom on top.. now King (yea.. they called it King) decided the big red head was a serious threat and needed to be promptly dealt with. From his usual position on the back of the couch he was right at the door and at just the right height to bat me in the head with his tail (that probably made up 4 of his 7 feet and was at least 2 inches across at the base). 

Fucker knocked me out cold.. I woke up to the parents leaning over me and freaking out / appologizing, saying he'd never done anything like that before etc. etc... I was fine.. but I still don't like lizards..

Many people chose to rip out the boiler required to run the system and install central heat.  Those people regretted it.  Radiant Floor Heating. Yes, they are very effective. They usually use a small boiler and run a type of liquid through the piping. Along with good use of insulation in the walls/floor/ceiling - these can save a lot of money in the long-run. And bare feet in winter are great!

Edit: A few people are saying this system pictured is electric. Perfectly possible, I know electric systems are also available. I work for a building supply company and we are just getting into the Radiant Heat in the past month or two.I went to Iceland in December, and was pleasantly surprised to find that many buildings are heated this way. They basically get free heated water from wells, and pump it through the floors. They were even in the process of getting this outside of the airport in Reykjavik.I never knew this looked that cool. I'd just throw some plexi glass over it and have some led strips and go all tron on it. The whole floor is lava and thus off limitsThat was my one regret when I had my bathroom redone, that I didn't get heated floor. I'm still kicking myself.The Weltzheimer/Johnson House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright had a system similar to this design.  That was back in 1948.  The problem occurred when the contractor ignored the grade of the material specified on the architectural drawing, and the system never worked properly.I lived in Korea for 5 years and every apartment I lived in had it. I really miss it.Rich friend had underfloor heating in his basment. A blanket on his concert floor felt better than my bedThese are great for bathroom floors! I've been looking for some kind of warming bath mat that doesn't require an outlet (because most bathroom outlets are high up so a wire would have to run all the way up and look unsightly) but apparently those are more of a thing in Japan than in the states...when i was in korea i had those boy it was so great . i wish we had them back in the states.Is this form of heating uncommon in the states? In Denmark where I live, nearly all houses (especially the ones built within the last 20 or so years) have them.Any idea whether these are more efficient?Well driller here, although it may cost a good chunk of change for the average home owner, vertical or horizontal geothermal loops can be drilled to various depths, essentially sharing Earth's energy with your home. I live in South Korea and this is the best thing ever. It's in every apartment. Just don't leave trash or laundry on the floor for too long. Wow I didnt know you can get that attention with somthing simple as a floor heating.
I live in switzerland and am a HVAC engenieer and this systems are standard since the 70es for residential buildings. Nowadays we plan them with water temperatures of around 30°-35°C, so the floor doesent really feel warm at all, but with really well insulated homes you dont need higher temperatures to heat the home which is really good if you use heatpumps because the efficency of the heatpumps are way better if you use low temperature systems like that.
The most efficient systems are TABS (thermo active building systems) where you build the pipes inside the concrete itself and use the concerete as a heat reserve, also good for cooling.

The City of Boston claims a 60% reduction in power consumption and full replacement paying of in just 2-3 years.  Fantastic program.The light pollution effect is *very* evident in this picture.  Notice the foliage between the lamps on either side--the traditional lighting shows an orange bleed for the entire area, yet the trees between the LED lamps are almost completely unilluminated.Those orange lights sure are going to be nostalgic in 20 years...Which city is this?From this angle, the LED lamp posts look to be more efficiently directing the light. Compared to the conventional post which appears to be shining light everywhere with limited efficiency. Unless there is a great deal of reflection of light from the pavement, I'd say that light pollution is less likely. The way I understand it, LED's are more directional that conventional light bulbs. But that's only my opinion.LED looks much more natural. I hate the orange street lights. Always have. Wish this was happening on my street!/r/darksky would like this.depends on the white balance on your camera tooThey started this in my city, and I'm actually not a fan of it.

I travel on a highway to work almost every day. The lamp posts are more spaced apart and much higher up than in this picture, so the light is less concentrated and the dark spots you see in this photo are much larger. 

The orange street lights spread the light out better and didn't leave dark patches like the LED's did. The LED's are worse during the winter as well because they are much dimmer in my city than in this picture. The orange lights help distinguish definition on the road much better, but with the LED street lights, its harder to tell where icy/deep snow patches might be.

These would be a great for city driving where the posts are usually shorter and closer together and would illuminate the street as well as it does in this picture, but for highway and winter driving, the orange is better.

But that's just my opinionI, personally, prefer warmer colored lights.They did this to my street sometime around 3 weeks ago. It only really decreases light pollution above lamp level. You know, reduces the pink sky effect. 

The HUGE downside is that the inside of my house looks like daytime now. And the light is blue. Blue = bad at night (thanks f.lux). 

I used to be able to sleep with my curtains open. White curtains. I hadn't slept well in a week, and had one of those aha moments when you're lying in bed at 2am, curtains closed, looking at the ceiling and thinking holy crap its bright blue in here, with the curtains closed, its bright as hell. 

Replaced my white curtains with red ones to mute out the blue, and now I'm fine. Then I think, how many people will lose sleep like me, and not realize the issue, and then wake up and screw my commute by driving tired and getting into accidents. 


And also, why couldn't the get a warmer colour temp for the LED's? Blue sucks, at least give me yellow or something. These new lights have been attracting the gypsy moths back

Wanna put shout out to r/invasivespecies for the info!I have no source for this, just something that I heard, but apparently there is some question over the long term health effects that replacing the sodium lamps will have. The white LEDs simulate sunlight, whereas the sodium lamps are more similar to candlelight in terms of coloring. I guess there is some discussion over whether or not this shift will disrupt the natural sleep cycles of people walking around at night, or even having this light shining in through their windows. 

On a small scale, the shift is not expected to be bad, but if they were to replace every street lamp, apparently there might be some problems. 

Anyone care to verify or dispute these claims? Idk if OP knows but the LED lamps probably look better in this picture because of the white balance setting on the camera that captured this shot. Maybe I'm nitpicking though.Chicago resident here... They have been slowly replacing the old street lights the the new LED bulbs over the past few years in our glorious city. They got to our street last fall and once the polar vortex struck with its powerful might we noticed the streets were dark at night. The new bulbs couldn't melt the snow and ice off the lamps like they use to!! They actually had crew go around and knock the buildup off. Thanks Obama!Replacing sodium vapor lamps with white LEDs as street lights is a good plan, but not a great one.  I think that replacing them with red or orange LEDs would have been a much better idea, since you still need your night vision once you leave that road that looks like it's lit by the sun.I hate the cold white of the LED street lamps... I liked my warm orange glow =(It's worth noting the Hwite balance of the photo is set to the temperature of the LED lights so it makes the Tungsten lights look like shit; not a really fair photography.

[A photograph I took for Instance](http://i.imgur.com/u5JREM5.jpg), the camera White Balance was set for the Tungsten lights up front, the halogen around the side as a result turned a a very noticeable Green color in the photography; with the naked eye the lights looked the same.I wish they'd tint them orange. It's easier on the eyes for night driving I thought. (Other than that the old ones were naturally reddish).That tall building in the background has a faceThe building almost directly centre looks so happy.Random note - the yellow/orange lights actually produce more lumens (more light) per bulb, but due to the light being more omni-directional and having a bad color-rendering index, to humans the LEDs appear like a much better light. This looked so Korean, so I zoomed in and found that it was Korea.LEDs are a complicated issue. They save energy but the cheapest kind emit blue-rich light which simulate the daylight which can be harmful to humans and animals alike. The rule to remember is to use red light at night. Just the other day, LEDs received a Nobel Prize. You can read about how that might affect dark skies and light pollution [here](http://darksky.org/night-sky-conservation/421).

I work as a mail carrier, and today I saw this HUGE turtle in the road, on a fairly busy road actually. So I put my mail in my bag and go to rescue him, all of the cars were changing lanes to avoid him (it was a two lane one way). I go in to grab him, and this white car comes up and isn't paying attention. He's texting and he doesn't change lanes.

I was one foot away from my turtle friend when he hits him going 45. Ruining my big little friend. He didn't die, but his body was torn in half and his shell was crushed. He lifted his head in agony and my heart broke. I'm a 25 year old man and I cried while I stood there. I couldn't save my friend from his fate.

Another car comes down within a minute or two and finishes him off. This time I was relieved he was no longer in pain.

Smells like a lawsuit.

At the very least they need to buy you a new Mattress and a 10 pack of visits to your local Chiropractor's office (mine does $75 for an extended visit with heat and electrical stimulus if you pay in cash)This is a lawsuit if it's actually real.

They actually have people visit and test hotel beds for softness.Do you live in Sudden Valley?Brings a whole new meaning to death bed.People used to always joke about why it is against the law to rip tags off of mattresses. This is why it's the law, so you don't buy a dud mattress from a shady dealer. (Though, it can be removed by the consumer, so you're lucky it is still there.)Sounds like it's from the Bluth model home.I would check your lease documents to see if there is any stipulations about the furniture, have a lawyer review it as well and write the landlord a letter to have a new mattress purchased or at least a prorated amount to purchase a new one. Also renters insurance might cover some chiropractic visits to help with the back pain. Most of all talk to a lawyer to see if there is a legal avenue for you to pursue. 
good luck!I wonder if Michael Bluth had this problem.Is this your house?

* there are lots of formations that they don't tell you about; like a ll the ""lint-ites"":  lint from people's clothes that get stuck on the formations.  volunteers come in the summer to clean the cave. (with hoses and tweezers)
* it's 59 degrees and 90% humidity downstairs, while it can be 95 degrees and really dry upstairs
* the best lighted formation in the cave is not labelled.  it's  to the left of the elevator in the big room, it's called the ""virgin of guadelupe"" (rangers are not allowed to point it out)
* it takes 90 years for something to grow as big as the tip of your pinky (from the last knuckle to the tip).  They know this because a passage was created between two rooms for a tour, and the stalactites growing on the ceiling of that new man-made passage (in 1920; well; now almost 100 years old) are that large. (for the kings-queens tour)
* lighting was done by professional stage /theater lighters.  Lighting for cave pictures is *really hard*.  if you go, I recommend just buying the post cards.
[Speaking of a wheelchair accessible pit into the abyss...](http://i.imgur.com/6ghcdDq.jpg)I remember this place for all the wrong reasons.

Our family took a 3 week long road trip around America and we stopped here. It was myself, Mom and Dad, and 4 other brothers. 3 of my brothers went ahead while my other brother (call him Brett) stayed with me  (still ahead of my parents). I was 10 at the time and I just remember Brett wandering in a small circle in the middle of the path looking up at the top. I called out his name, he collapsed and I immediately ran and got my parents. People passing by offered and hand while I ran and got help from paramedics.My dad and Brett went back up while my mom and I continued downward (she physically couldn't walk back up the ramp). Terrified and concernced, we continued on the path with some of the darkest blackness we'd ever experienced trying to find my other 3 brothers. long story short, we find a ranger after a wn hour or so, describe my brothers to her and guides us to the bottom. Thankfully my brother recovered and we continued on our trip with just a 1 day delay.

TL;DR: On vacation here brother collapsed from a seizure and we lost 3 of my brothers in the cavernWas there last weekend. Can confirm, there was a guy who almost ran over my toes with a motorized wheelchair 750 ft below ground. Probably took the elevator though.

Cus it get cold like Minnesota.It's a lovely picture, but a little editing would really help bring it out.  Some noise reduction, especially in the shadows, would help clean up the tones and a little bump in contrast and clarity would help it pop.

[I gave it a little play in photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/YWPZVHE.jpg) - mainly what I said and also straightening the lines up a little.    There wasn't a whole lot I could do with the low-res JPEG.  

Editing is a very important part of the photographic process.  Getting the image as correct as possible in camera is great, but editing is almost always needed to tidy it up.  

Another little tip, is that print you've had done on canvas?  Get it printed on good quality semi-gloss paper and framed (even a really cheap, basic frame) and it'll do the image the justice it deserves.  You could probably get it printed on decent paper for $10-15, and a frame like [this](http://www.therange.co.uk/fashion-black-box-frame//the-range/fcp-product/51577) - with the photo either window-mounted or at least with a white border between the image and frame.

This is a great example showing why honey bees die after stinging something only once. Their stinger/venom sac are attached to other organs inside the bee, so when the stinger's barbs lodge into something, everything gets pulled out, potentially including gut, etc and leaving a gaping hole in the bees abdomen.

Another interesting fact: the stinger that gets left behind is composed of the stinger/barb, the venom sac, a layer of muscle tissue surrounding the venom sac and a nerve ganglion attached to the muscle. Independent of the bee, that nerve ganglion continues to contract the muscle around the venom sac, pumping more and more venom into the victim even if the bee has run off.  This is why when you get stung by a bee, you want to scrape the stinger out ASAP with a flat tool. (Don't try to pull it out with your fingers, you'll just squish the venom sac and empty it all in at once).[deleted]If I ever have a metal band, this will be the cover to my album.Spiderman.  Venom.

Next it will be lizards and snakes and the government is going to shut it all down and limit it to dogs and miniature horses like they did for service animals. 

These hipsters are just shitting in the punch bowl because anyone can pay a shrink to say a fucking turkey is an emotional support animal.

So when all of this comes to a head in a perfect storm where someone's therapy python eats a therapy turkey 30,000 feet above Colorado I'll get to say I told you so. Looks like Sweet Dee in ""The Gang Beats Boggs""Adam Carolla has a whole bit about taking Giligan, his attack pelican, onto a flight as therapy pet.  

Life isn't much wackier than comedy.IF you are so unstable that you can't fly on a plane without a live turkey, you should not fly. Imagine if that bird died mid flight? Buddy could do anything. avian flu - the originDelta airlines requires a mental health professional to provide written documentation that the passenger is being treated for a diagnosed mental health disability and the animal is a necessary part of treatment. Further, the animal is required to be trained to behave. I'm guessing this passenger didn't follow those rules, and the crew and gate agents didn't know enough to deny passage.

From the website:

**Acceptance Guidelines**

May or may not be trained to perform observable functions. However, the animal must be trained to behave properly in public settings as service animals do. Emotional support animals travel free of charge and the animal is exempt from cabin allotment. Like service animals, emotional support animals can be transported in the cabin.

Delta requires documentation *(not more than one year old) on letterhead from a licensed mental health professional to be presented to an agent upon check in stating:

* Title, address, license number and jurisdiction (state/country it was issued), phone number, and signature of mental health professional.
* The passenger has a mental health related disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 4th Edition.
* That the passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination.
* That the person listed in the letter is under the care of the assessing physician or mental health professional.

*Passengers may use a signed or stamped digital letter on their mobile device as long as the information can be verified (i.e. phone numbers, email addresses etc.)I'd be doing this the entire flight to the bird 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zvgcOrTtwMy hopes of one day having a service Cassawary have been reignited!The only reason anyone would ever need a goddamn dumb dinosaur like a turkey for a therapy animal is if they needed absolute reassurance they weren't quite the stupidest organism in the room. And even then, itd be close.If their plane crashes in the mountains at least they won't need to start eating each other right away like those soccer players did.I hate these assholes, it makes it so much harder for those of us with legitimate, trained, vetted and certified service dogs.

I tried so hard to be nice about it for so long but I just can't any more. The day someone's glorified pet, with no public access training attacked my service dog was the day the minor annoyance of it became a real issue I'm pushed passed my limits on. You want to take your unleashed, uneutered mastiff with a piece of shit paper you bought online everywhere for the attention? Fuck you. 

When that dog bit someone on the bus now we all have to pay for photo ID of us and our dog, thankfully I already have that since one of countries I regularly travel to(in the EU) requires it.

--
**Remember business owners:** 
Even certified service dogs, let alone bullshit ESAs,  have a set of public access behaviour guidelines, you CAN remove an animal who is NOT behaving within those guidelines. 

The dog taking the initiative of greeting strangers approaching the animal should be a clue the dog is not properly public accessed trained. The dog should automatically ignore others because it is WORKING, as in focused on it's handler and it's job.


This even includes the handler responsibilities, like keeping the animal from being any kind of nuisance- via position on the floor or noise or general disruptiveness; and keeping the animal groomed, clean and non-offensive to the general public. Dogs will always smell somewhat like dogs but the dog should not be excessively smelly, should not be drooling excessively, should not be shedding excessively as the animal should be brushed daily by the handler or helper. Nails should be tidily cut and not damaging floors. 
Harness/ID vests should be clean and properly fitted. (in the US service dogs do not have to have badges or harnesses, but this is pretty ridiculous, almost everyone with a certified service dog will have it wearing it's identification vest/badge and harness because it makes life easier for the handler!! If the badges on the dog says 'do not seperate from handler' there is a reason for this- please respect this, yes even in an emergency. For example my dog traveled with me in the ambulance after a serious car accident until we absolutely had to be separated so he could receive medical treatment. During something like an MRI/X ray he is in the operator's hut in the same room as the machine but protected. )
 


And remember: ESAs do NOT have federal access rights. They have some housing and transport rights but they DO NOT have access rights to stores, theatres or restaurants!

(Also the Service Dog Foundation is now training ESA cats with proper certification and are vetted behaviour-wise, if you need a non service dog but do need an ESA get a properly trained and bred one. Get a prescription, apply to an accrediated organisation, preferable ADI certified,  and get on the waiting list like those of use with seizues/are blind and low vision have to do. Stop with this special snowflake pretend service animal bullshit. I'm sorry to sound so mean but in the past three years the rise of this ESA crap has been a real burden on those of us with real service dogs. The animal just existing is not  a job. Training a proper, bomb proof service dog starts *before the puppy's eyes are even open!!*)More like ""anxiety animal"" for me. I would constantly be worried that thing we attack others or myself hahaI'd need therapy if that thing was looking at me for 2 hours.[Gobbels!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeOeIwKJ67g)I thought turkeys can't fly.What I want to know is how do they keep the turkey from shitting everywhere?! Does it have a bag to catch the poo?I thought turkeys are widely considered to be assholes? Perhaps if you suffer from such anxiety that you need a therapy turkey, you should drive instead of flying. 600 miles in a car with a live turkey sounds like the perfect thing to prevent this insane shit from happening.As a Vegan, I have a therapy-cucumber. You'd never guess where I hide it. One flew over the turkey's nestMaybe that turkey is full of narcotics.

Their babies are lain in clutches and then promptly forgotten (though even to say that they are forgotten is incorrect, since forgetting requires some initial presence of mind: in truth this tortoise has perhaps never been truly aware [in the human sense] of what exactly its instincts force it to do). There is no plausible scenario in which those little tortoises would possibly find themselves on top of their mother: first because they are tiny and second because their mother is no more significant to them than a pile of dirt or a largish chunk of granite. In fact it is in the baby tortoises' best interest to stay away from their mother since (as I said before) the mother has no maternal instinct whatsoever and could easily and inadvertently crush them underfoot or knock them on their backs or harm them in some other way (the chance of this happening is admittedly pretty slim, but there is certainly a greater chance that the mother will hurt them rather then help them [which {I pray I have made abundantly clear} is exactly zero since tortoises have no maternal instincts whatsoever]). This is anthropomorphising at its worst and images like this that actively misinform people through implication are no different than any other kind of clickbait in that they convolute a genuinely interesting subject by (rather than putting forth the effort required to present something both interesting and informative) simply slapping an eye-catching title on a misleading image. Can we not simply accept that certain animals behave differently than us? This is a successful reproductive strategy: the product of millions upon millions of years of evolution (or perhaps not: I can't imagine ignoring your children requires a lot of evolutionary finesse: but still, the fact that it has not changed into something else speaks to how effective it is).

I didn't have any destination I wanted to explore. It is a big city, but it is also not big.

The thing that amazed me is that architecture and history you can find that are off the main tourist areas. You can walk and see a building 400 plus years old with old historic doors. Inside a courtyard with cobble stones and people living their lives in buildings that would be historic in America.

You can walk by and go inside many churches hundreds of years old that people still use. See one of the small Museums that dot the city. Walking you can find the most amazing restaurants, grab a quick drink and see the city move around you.

Maybe I should feel bad, but when walking Paris I couldn't help to think to myself I am glad the French left the war early and it was spared destruction in the war. I get weird Devil May Cry vibes from it.Pretty sure that's also the door from Casper... or at least very close to it. An amazing example of art nouveau.First stop after retirement: Paris. Any takers?  I speak French. Must see it before it's detroyed in some dumb money/oil war.Belle Epoque was the epitome of that kind of design. It died with WW1 and the end of the European empires. I wish Art Nouveau would return. It was very labour intensive but perhaps CNC, CAD and 3D printing will see it return in a updated fashion. Its so florid and strikes me as 'human'. ""Arts Craft"" in many ways is a distilled version of this, boiling designs to their bare, hand made essentials.

It must have seemed like the end of the era of Legend, to those who born in this period, grew up and then served in WW1.We not talking about the massive cock  on the door? Reminds me of a pun in French/English.

I can see it thinking of it as a positive reward if it brings something back to it's pack (in this case, the owner).  Or maybe it just likes chewing on sticks (it could help dental hygiene, be entertaining, seem like a replacement for doggie toys or actual prey), and it drops them in the same spot near the house before it goes inside?  Or maybe it's akin to a nest-building tendency in other species to collect things from around their environment that could either provide shelter or potentially impress a mate.I believe your dog is a hoarder.

[This blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/) explains the whole story. 

Today (by co-incidence) there was a [follow-up post](http://digileaders.com/ok-think-loud-organisational-culture/) with some other thoughts.

To answer a few of the questions I've seen in the thread:

* I work at the UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) and yes, we are hiring
* yes this is real
* no, there was no input from Human Resources or from senior management
* we did it because we work in an organisation where doing things like this is ok
* it's not aspirational; this is a list of things newcomers need to know about how things already are
* yes that's our office building in central London, but we share the building with other organisations so it's not all ours
* the poster mentions Slack because Slack is one of the tools we use to get stuff done; we use many other tools too :)
* as others have pointed out, there's a print-your-own PDF linked from [the original blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/), so if you'd like to put a copy up on your wall, you can

> stay home when you feel ill

I wish more people did this. I work in a large building with a lot of employees. They'll cough, sniffle, sneeze, wipe their nose and just generally leak. 

It's gross, and you're not a 'trooper"" for working when you're sick, you're putting me at risk of catching whatever nasty-ass shit you've caught.

Stay home and rest - don't make the rest of us have what you have.

EDIT: of course this only applies to companies that give you sick time![Picture of the boss.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yHJVlf-SLgg/UjSxTIsZR6I/AAAAAAAAAPs/DbeAaLDZ18k/s1600/office-space-lazy-mode.png)This would only encourage me to work harder and be more loyal to the company. No, it's bloody well not okay to sing at work. Not everyone has a pleasant voice. This only works with people who *want* to work. The kind of people who want their work to always be top notch because they feel it's a reflection of them as a person. If you happen to find the rare office full of these people, then these kinds of policies provide the necessary freedom for the job to get done the most efficiently and at the highest quality.

In the countless offices and jobs where people are just there to collect a check, this absolutely does not work. And I'm not necessarily always blaming the employees. Some jobs are just shit and no one would ever *want* to work it. It just is what it is sometimes.Plot twist: This is an ad for Slack.Where I work the list would fit on a sticky note.

It's ok to......work, because that's what I'm paying you for. Now get back to work and stop wasting my money reading notes on the wall.Employees can be treated like people? I didn't know that was an option.I like the ""not check your email out of hours"" bit.

Nothing pisses me off more than getting hounded for not responding to emails, when I haven't had a chance to check them.

*walk into office*

""Hey, you never responded to my email.""

""When did you send it?""

""Last night, at around 7pm.""

""....correct, I didn't respond. I wasn't working at that time.""

*fast forward when someone complains about it*

""Part of your job expectation is that you check your email and respond promptly.""

""Okay, then show me that clause in my contract. Because I'm pretty sure my contract states that I'm supposed to do my job well, as instructed, and on time. Now if you want to add a 'must check email every few hours' clause to that contract, by all means, go for it; but, it better be accompanied by a higher wage.""

&nbsp;

Aaaaaaaand, while I'm on this rant:

""Hey, I'm still waiting on a response to that email I sent you.""

""You mean the email asking me <insert random question>?""

""Yes""

""Well, we had a one-on-one meeting about it. And *then,* the next day, you asked me about it in person again. I considered the question to be answered (twice) at that point. So no, I did not respond to the email (outside of work hours), because I considered it to be a waste of my time.""

""Well, I need written confirmation from you.""

""That's absolutely understandable, but if that's the case, DON'T FUCKING ASK ME ABOUT IT - *TWICE* - IN PERSON. Or at least have the forethought to say: ""hey, I know we already talked about this, but I'd just like written confirmation."" That's a little better - BIT EVEN SO: if you really need the written confirmation, then don't bother with the in-person questions. Send an email. Ask questions. Get answers. Boom - written confirmation, and we've both only had to address this issue one time. That means that we're not getting paid to waste time, and I'm not slowly hating you for asking the same question multiple times.

&nbsp;

Sorry guys - I could go on and on and on about this. Apparently I ""have a reputation for not responding to emails,"" and it just blows my mind. No one at my office seems to agree with my rules, which are as follows:

1) If you send an email during off-hours, expect a response during on-hours. 

2) If it is urgent, and cannot wait, call me. Even if it's to say ""hey, I know it's 8pm on a Saturday, but there's a serious situation that needs addressing. Are you available to check your email?""

3) If you ask me a question in person, do not ask me the same question in an email, unless you at least acknowledge that it is a follow up, and you just need confirmation.

Work hours are work hours. Off hours are off hours. I'm perfectly willing to spend some off-hours working from time to time, as it's something we all have to do now and then; however, do not expect me to be glued to my email, as if I have nothing better to do than to work for you while not getting paid.

&nbsp;

FUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKK

&nbsp; 

EDIT: Whoa! I don't know if this qualifies as ""RIP inbox,"" but I surely did not expect this many replies! A couple of responses that may put things into context:

&nbsp;

1) This is not a salaried position. I freelance (to an extent), so these are part-time office hours at this company. I *absolutely* agree that, if I were salaried here, then I should be less hostile about unnecessary emails, and way more appreciative of that fact that I'm pulling in a decent annual, completely stable and reliable income. 

2) Although I *do* believe in everything I said, and stand by it, I'm not really this hostile at the workplace. In comes Reddit, where I can enjoy writing up a fiery rant - the type that I would never actually display at the office (although I have made these opinions known, diplomatically)

3) Given that I really provided no information as to what I do, where I do it, or what my office situation is like, I totally sympathize with those of you who think I just hate my job, suck at it, don't put in any extra effort, and won't ""climb the ladder,"" (so to speak); however, it's probably worth noting that I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisors and coworkers, and though I have this reputation about emails, I also have a reputation for doing far more work than is required (and happily so, because I *do* believe in the company and its overall goals), as well as a reputation of going out of my way to help guide other workers in how to do their jobs more effectively. I love my job, but it is a small company, and because I believe in it, it sometimes feels like a full time gig - without the benefits. Perhaps that is why I get a little snarky about off-hours emails.

4) Lastly, the head of the company has almost always taken my side in this issue, and has complained to managers about sending six emails that could be consolidated into one, as well as trying to limit emails to office hours (when it's not an emergency). This was meant to be more of a Lewis Black style ""let me rant about this small thing!,"" rather than a ""my company is absolute shit for doing this to me."" (That being said, again, I stand by my reactions!)

&nbsp;

SECOND EDIT: and my gold cherry has been popped, it would seem. Obligatory thanks, kind strangerSeeing this makes me feel happy knowing that there are good employers out there, and simultaneously sad that I work in an exploitative hell-hole where most of the things on this list are *not* ok.Lots of people asking where this is, are they hiring, or saying it's made up...

It's from the team at the UK's Government Digital Service. 

https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/Judging by the comments here, inclusive workplaces aren't as common as I thought.  This is just basic respect for your employees, I'm bummed a lot of people think this is a weird idea.


Edit:  To clarify, I'm bummed that people are forced to work at places that reward presenteeism and conformity, as I was naiively under the impression that more workplaces understood that those aren't the best ways to get optimal results from your employees.  I wasn't saying that you're all fascists or a part of a major problem if this way of working is new to you.  There used to be a course on EdX by Catalyst about this kind of thing that is probably still available for audit if anyone is interested.Are they hiring?Irony - most people are reading this on Reddit at work.That looks like a cool building!The only explanation. They grow marijuana. Well this makes me sad about my job even more. Serious question. Am I the only one who wonders if I'm lazy, or just want more from my job than just a paycheck? Or am I alone in this one?file under: notes i'll never see at my jobit's ok to....

-don't slam on your brakes (additionally: check your car manual if your car requires brake pumping or not)

-before braking, let up the gas first for about 2 seconds before using the brake pedal

-increase your braking distance significantly compared to dry conditions. You will slide if you attempt to stop at what may seem a reasonable rate normally and lose control (thanks, /u/my_dog_is_cool)

-keep a cars length between you and driver in front of you when stopped

-if you know you are going or about to go over a bridge, don't accelerate or brake unless you need to (bridge ices before road)

-accelerate while going up hills

-don't ever break going up hills

-don't ever use cruise control

-if the light turns green before you approach the intersection (meaning you did not make a full stop yet), proceed with caution (someone from the previous light might still slip in the intersection on accident)

-look both ways when the light turns green before proceeding

-keep the top of your car free of snow (for drivers behind you)

-keep the hood of your car free of snow (for your benefit when that wind blows)

-put your emergency blinkers on the moment you are seriously stuck

-wear sunglasses during the daytime (you'll see outlines of curbs and medians better)

-never use your brights (it's like a million mirrors blinding you)

The play event in the middle, a spring rider, is classified as a ""sitting-rocking motion event"", and as such, has a 6' ""use zone"" around it, in which no other play events can be located. It looks to me like that's a 13'x15' space or so, so *just* big enough to accommodate this thing. Furthermore, they wanted accessible seating and trash disposal, meaning you need wheelchair-traversible surfacing all the way around both features (the bench and bin). Finally, at that point they probably live in a place that requires fencing around non-supervised play areas, so naturally to save money, they made it as small as possible. Honestly, you see shit like this all the time, where people don't understand the cost and rules of commercial play equipment.
  
tl;dr - there are tons of stupid rules for playgrounds that lead to things like this.Gotta keep all that fun caged in.Good thing there's a fenceI instantly envision a kid on that little bike who doesn't even want to be there and an over caffeinated dad, sitting on that bench yelling, ""HAVE YOUR FUN, BILLIE...BOUNCE HARDER, SON... THIS IS YOUR CHILDHOOD... I SAID BOUNCE!!!""Chesterfield? Yeah, cause it never started.That's Britain for you.Hell, even Mr.Bones' Wild Ride is more interesting than this.""Fuck it, the chavs will be getting drunk here every weekend anyway and will destroy the place, that'll do"".I bet there's going to be queues round the block in the summer. 

They might have to limit the kids to a bounce each to enable everybody to have a turn.This looks like it could be used for some kind of tortureAs an older guy, I'm glad they have the soft fall rubber around it.

Those things are a bitch to ride!I used to live in a moderately bad neighborhood as a teen. One problem we had were that there a few registered sex offenders in the area. So the city built a park. It was literally just a bench, some flowers and a sign that said ""The Park"". So by law in that county or city or state, not sure which, registered sex offenders couldn't live within a certain area of the park. This also applied to schools, daycares or any other places kids meet. So any of the registered sex offenders had to move.
This may be a similar situation.

Edit: not pedophiles, but registered sex offenders.

[It looked like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Comptometer_model_E.png), but the copper body was pretty heavily tarnished and almost black like a really old worn penny. However, it still worked. After taking everything apart (there were hundreds of individual parts: springs, levers, gears, etc.), lubricating everything and polishing the copper shell it looked even better than the photo above, like a shiny new penny. It was incredibly impressive to see how such a complex device was put together (and very satisfying to be able to take it apart and put it back together without screwing it up!). I took photos of the inside, which I don't have access to right now, but [here's an internet pic of the inside with the shell taken off](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/08/comptometer_interior.jpg).

It's like something out of a nightmare, where this thing is broken and it's my job to fix it. I've taken it apart, but I can't remember where any of the parts go. :oI used to repair these things, mechanical typewriters as well, then graduated to electo-mechanical adding machines and IBM typewriters.

Zoom in and look at the sharks eyes. That's what a surprised shark looks like. That's a juvenile bull shark, so it will give you a nasty nip but is not really dangerous. They are in pretty much every river and residential canal estate in Australia. Bull sharks are born and grow up in fresh water, entering the ocean when they are grown, where they are indeed a bunch of dicks.

There are two types of croc in Australia: freshwater crocs (aka freshies), and saltwater crocs (aka salties). Brutus is a salty.

Determining the difference is easy enough. Simply jump into the river. If the croc quietly climbs out on the opposite bank and gives you a surly look, it's a freshie.

If the croc surges toward you, grabs your leg and pulls you under the water in a choas of flailing limbs, rolls around a few times and drowns you, then swims off and plants your body in a mud bank,  returning to take a bite from your rotting corpse every couple of days, then it was a salty.He stopped the shark from drowning.

The signification of this attack is very strong. They wounded freedom.
Four cartoonists, they killed an economist too, Bernard Maris, I listened him on national radio ""France Inter"" on the morning.
RIPThe sad thing is that many have hoped media around the world would publish the cartoons that led to this tragedy. But what has actually happened is media blurring the cartoons in fear. Example from the Telegraph in the UK: http://i.imgur.com/lwcqqrY.png

Edit: Full context on the page: http://i.imgur.com/eYKGcaw.pngThe cartoonists are Cabu and Charb, but other people have been killed too, including cartoonists Wolinski and Tignous.

[Wolinski](http://a404.idata.over-blog.com/500x479/2/31/51/01/758/Wolinski.gif) - Translation: the sign reads *Attack claimed by far-right extremists* ; Policemen: ""Walk slower, or we'll have no choice but to arrest them!"" ; Perpetrators: ""Walk faster, or they'll have no choice but to arrest us!""  
NOTE: Wolinski did very few policital drawings compared to his peers and was mostly known for his drawings on sexual perversion. I selected this drawing because a) it's the only political one I could find and b) it's one of the few that aren't NSFW.

[Tignous](http://marcsuivre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/caricature-tignous-islam1.jpg) - Translation: Man: ""You ought to cover yourself!"" ; Woman: ""Do you want it in the gabber, my Hand of Fatima?""[this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Wolinski) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignous) also, apparently. RIPThey apparently yelled that they were avenging Mohammed. What kind of god or prophet needs vengeance from a comic? These attacks don't show people's strength of conviction, they show the weakness of their beliefs. No one has ever strapped a bomb to their chest because of their belief in quantum mechanics or group theory.Between the majority of media's decision not to show these artists' works uncensored, and Sony caving to North Korea's (partially successful) attempt to prevent the release of The Interview, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the way our culture has caved to the violent, threatening tactics of fanaticism. Free-thinking nations should not be shriveling up like this in the face of hatred and oppression of thought. What a shameful time we live in.Jesus fucking christ, it's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated.

And no, these aren't one-way roads. Speed at your peril. [Here's another](https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.218564,-6.147497&spn=0.000944,0.002926&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=53.218551,-6.147628&panoid=wK6lfG1bq8PTND5iOMjK0Q&cbp=13,265.91,,0,11.7). Also many drivers in Ireland don't consider this a ""speed limit"", but instead more of a suggested or required average.

""Well if it says 80, I better go 80"".

Prepare to be airborne for most of this lane.Back to boards.ie with ye, lads. The beginning of The Guard is good for an idea of what most roads are like. Black humour on the speed and the Guards in Ireland.rural roads in Ireland are the stuff of dreams if you enjoy driving, it makes you a better driver you have no choice about it :P
nothing scarier than being flat down a back road and seeing a tractor pulling out of a gap :P keep her country ;)Some people do drive far too quickly on those sorts of roads. I think often they're locals who assume that because they know every turn and bump on the road and drive it at speed every day nothing unexpected will ever happen.

Setting a speed limit for a local road like that is a matter for the local council. There is a [national review](http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0208/speed.html) of speed limits ongoing in Ireland at the request of the Minister for Transport. The aim is to bring them into line with guidelines circulated by the government in January 2011. It is, ironically, a very slow process.http://imgur.com/G4OXx

It's also probably a dual carriageway.Stick the Subaru logo in the corner and we've got ourselves a winning billboard advertisement.My brother drives very fast down country lanes a little wider than that in England. 

On a moonlit night he will turn his headlights off and drive even faster, to show how well he knows the roads, and say ""don't worry, if a car's coming the other way we'll see his headlights"" ... [brief pause] ... ""unless it's Dave. Dave likes to do this too"". And then he smiles. Being an American that's driven the majority of the Emerald Isle, I was constantly amazed at how ridiculous the speed limits were. I'd go maybe 20 km/h under the limit, feel I was going too fast and still have people up against my back bumper. Driving there is, in a word, insane.I learned to drive manual on vacation in Ireland.  Zipping around those roads in a tiny car was the most enjoyable driving experience of my life.    Taking the coastal road in Co Clare was gorgeous, and dodging the massive tour buses just added an extra challenge.  For safety of life and limb I preferred to stick to the R roads though.That's actually an old picture, there's a toll bridge just after the speed limit sign now. My friend went to Northern Ireland and tore the driver's side mirror off the rental car on one of these roads when meeting an oncoming truck. When he returned the car they were just like ""Yeah, that's what happens. Have a nice day.""As an Irishman I can assure you all that 80kph is a grand speed for this road. You don't even need to steer, those soft looking ditches on either side will gently nudge you back on track if you lose your way.Damn, I miss Ireland. 

Nice landscape & reasonable speed limits.

(Also, as a german, i must insist: 80 km/h != Autobahn !)Thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x84r.jpg) was pretty funny my first time there on those narrow roads.There's nothing more terrifying than when I'm in the passenger seat of my gf's car, and she takes he country roads out to Donegal and they're all exactly like this picture. We'll pass an 80kmph sign, and she'll turn to me with this evil grin like ""I'm gonna fuck you up!""

We're from N. Ireland where the roads laws are a bit more strict. I think Dara O'Brien but it best. 

In the UK there is Legal and Illegal. Righ and Wrong.
In the Republic of Ireland, there are 3 levels. 
1. That's Grand. 
2. Ah now, don't push it.
3. You're taking the piss.  One of my most vivid memories of Ireland is driving on a two-lane road the size of a shoulder on a cliff-side and having people whiz by at 80 km/h.WHOAH, here in spain the limit in not paved roads are 30km/h.

No really though this is the most impressive thing I've seen in forever.Senator Franken is sharp as anything, and actually an excellent senator.

Storytime: My mother was (recently retired) a teacher. She met the Senator about five, six years back when he came to her school to talk to the kids. He actually drew one of these in front of them as he talked. He then spent some time in the teacher's lounge talking to my mom. At the time, my father was in the process of dying of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, which they discussed.

He met her again a few years later, and asked after him (by name, mentioning the disease - didn't just file it away under ""random teacher - sick husband""), and gave his condolences. He remembered that shit the whole time, after one meeting. Didn't need to - he had her vote to begin with and he knew it - he's just got a memory like a freaking vice.

I feel like I always see pictures of it,but I have no idea how it happens.  Google guy op, takes no credit for the work, credits photographer and links to other work.is there a higher res version?
Colima is like that.  It's rather young (about 5 million years), rather tall (12,595 feet with a 2,000 foot prominence), and highly active (more than 40 eruptions in the last 500 years).  So it's not that difficult to end up getting awesome pictures of it.

[Or this](http://i.imgur.com/szdpRIN.jpg)

It's also a Decade Volcano, one of 16 in the world that are given extra research and study due to their activity levels, destructive eruptions, and proximity to population centers.  There have been five eruptions at Colima in the last 18 months.How do you take an 8 second exposure but not have lots of blur from the moving smoke and possible vibrations in the ground?r/EarthPornDo you want to become my desktop background? Because that's how you become my desktop background. That backdrop is really what makes this photo shine. Just the stars in the background seem to really help this excellent shot pop out.It still feels entirely unfair to me that volcanos can *also* produce lightning. Like, what can't they accomplish? They create land. They create atmosphere. They royally fuck shit up under the right/wrong circumstances, depending on your point of view.

http://i.imgur.com/B3FUlc2.png...Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, Bosun's Mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.Practically all people on the ship are black, practically all people in the water are white.

>Here's the background story; late one night, after a few beers, I painted [this](http://i.imgur.com/NUQl7.jpg) in the local dog park. My friend snuck an article about it into a local newspaper. Someone who works for Chorus (the company that owns these utility boxes) saw the article, and got in touch with me (they had been [commissioning artists](https://www.chorus.co.nz/cabinet-art) to decorate these DSL cabinets for a few years already). 

>I get paid a small fee for each one - enough to cover time and materials. I used Internet memes as the inspiration for a lot of them, because they are our physical Internet connections - chances are images like AstroSloth and Awkward Seal, etc, had already been transmitted through these boxes before I painted them.

Officer Clarke was a great guy. Cops like him, and this guy really set the standard for what it means to be a public servant. My father was a paramedic in the city for 30 years..he has never cut a dead body out of a seat belt.
Edit: thanks for the gold! To clarify, Every time my father has had to cut a seat belt, the person was alive. Seat belts save lives, so do helmets. I always wear my seat belt, even if I'm driving around the block, not because I don't trust my own driving,..but I don't trust anyone else.This is heartbreaking.  One of my biggest somewhat irrational fears is that they won't be able to find someone to quickly take care of my kids if something unexpectedly happens to me.  I imagine they'd be so confused and scared.  I hope they found this little girl's relatives quickly.This brings back so many memories from when I was 7- years-old. All 8 members of my family were on a road trip in a 7 passenger van all of us were wearing seatbelts except my 4-year-old brother, Jake, who was sitting in my 12-year-old sister's lap, Cara. It was morning and I was asleep in the front seat while my dad was driving. Next thing I know I wake up hanging in the air because the van had rolled and finally settled on the driver's side.

Everyone was out of the car already and my dad helped me climb out through the back of the van. As soon as I step out I see my oldest sister(17),Lynn, covered in blood and my 10-year-old sister, Jess screaming for someone to help Lynn. Someone guided me and Jess away from the accident and set us on a blanket facing an empty field. We moved to a truck when it started raining before riding in an ambulance with my mom and Jake on a stretcher.

The 5 of us who were wearing our seat belts properly walked away hardly any scratches. Lynn wasn't wearing her shoulder belt and went half way out the window and broke her clavicle and got around 40 staples in her leg and some stitches. She stayed in the hospital a few days and made a full recovery. 

Jake and Cara were the only ones not wearing seatbelts at all. They were ejected from the car together and Cara acted as a cushion for Jake and very likely saved his life. He needed some stitches but was fine otherwise. Cara died within minutes.

After the fact I learned that Cara had been wearing her seatbelt just minutes before the accident. Lynn had asked Cara to get something from the back and she and Jake were both leaning over the backseat at the time of the accident.

Don't even take your seatbelt off for a second.[deleted]""Police say the two adults and four kids in the SUV were not properly restrained. All of them were ejected in the crash.""

OK. This is terrible but if you can't use your fucking seat belts to protect your family...People please wear your damn seat belt!! I just pulled a guy out of his over turned Ford Taurus in front of my house that had flipped 4 times Monday of this week who survived because he was wearing his seat belt. If he hadnt been im almost positive he wouldve been dead easily. It is in the car for a reason!Some years back I rear ended another driver. Slammed into the back of their car at about 50mph. We all walked away okay. My airbag and seatbelt kept me okay. I ended up with a small burn on my arm from the airbag. Apparently even the officer told me it was a high accident area.

Now recently I was getting ready to head to Disneyland with my inlaws and infant son. We're getting ready to get into the car and I noticed the number of people(5 adults and an infant) and their car is a five seater. I asked if we we're taking two cars and they said the baby was going to ride on somebody's lap. I was a wee bit pissed and put my foot down. My son rode in his car seat and we crammed three adults in the back seat. If they want to risk their safety that's fine. But like Hell I was going to let them risk my son's.[deleted]It's 2015. How in the actual hell are people still not using seatbelts? I don't even realize that I'm putting it on - it's just a reflex as is putting the keys in the ignition. You really have to make a conscious decision to not put your seatbelt on. I don't feel like it's something that you just forget to do. If I'm not buckled in, I feel that everything is horribly wrong.Here's a story I don't like telling much, but maybe it will convince somebody.

When I was 18 or 19, I lived overseas near an American air base in Germany and worked on base.  Every morning, I would leave for work later than I should have, and speed the whole way through these little villages and country roads.  If you've ever driven in Pennsylvania or other states in the area, kinda like that.

Near the base, there was a big blind corner that was pretty fun to go fast on, hugging the inside.  I did this hundreds of times, usually bleary-eyed and tired in the morning from staying up too late on AOL talking to this girl.  No big deal, the road was wide enough and there was rarely any traffic in the morning.

Then, one particular morning, I went around that curve and saw a woman in the street waving her arms.  I slowed down, and as I was doing so, I saw the car on its roof off to the left, and a body in the road about fifty yards ahead.  I pulled over, put my blinkers on, got out the warning triangle and first aid kit and ran over to the arm waver. I was the second person on the scene.

The obvious conversation happened, and I called whatever the 911 equivalent was over there, spoke broken English to some German guy, and then went to see what I could do about the woman in the street.

Her car was on its roof, and it was still running.  Something was playing on the radio and the exhaust pipe was emitting exhaust.  It was cold enough that you could see the exhaust. I turned the car off, and went back to the woman.  I have no useful medical training beyond some very basic first aid and a lapsed CPR certification, so all I could do was talk to her and put my coat and some emergency blankets on her.  She obviously had a head wound and was in and out of almost-consciousness. It had been drizzling, so the road was damp.  Her head was bleeding.  I can still see the water on the road mixed with her blood, and the dirt and rocks pressed in to the skin of her face, where her sweater was ripped on her shoulder, and the scratches on her skin.

Time passes.  No emergency services.  By this time I'd stopped traffic and spoken to the arm-waver about what had happened.  She'd seen it.  The victim went around the corner at the same time as a big truck coming the other way.  The truck was over the line a bit, and she over-corrected, flipped, and was ejected.

Called 911 again.  Same kind of conversation.  A little bit of time passes.  Finally this guy runs up with a baby in his arms.  He's her husband and got stuck in the traffic jam caused by his wife's accident.  He walked up to see what was going on and found out.  There's nothing he can do either.  Some emergency services from the base finally show up after somebody else had called, and they start doing their thing.  Those of us who are close enough to the scene are told to drive away and leave so that a helicopter can land soon.  I take my coat back, drive to work, and wash the blood off of my hands and my phone, and hide in the back for a little while so I can compose myself.

I had nightmares for about a month after that.  Not because of what I had seen really, but because if I had been maybe five or ten minutes earlier, if I was the first one on the scene and hadn't been stopped by the arm-waver, I probably wouldn't have been able to stop in time.  With wet roads like that, I probably would have driven over the victim in the road as I realized what was happening.  You can imagine what my dreams were about.

So, pay attention, and wear your goddamn seatbelts.
My friend, In a church group, got in a car accident in a head on collision going 55. Every person, except her, wasn't wearing their seat belt. Her mother, father, and 5 others were ejected from the vehicle. 3 people including her mother died, her father was a paraplegic and everyone else had severe injuries. She had a broken arm and some bruising. Seat belts save your your fucking life. This man can prove it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp""... Look for the helpers. You will always find people that are helping.""  - Mr. RogersNo matter how bad my day at the office is, I'm fucking glad I don't have to do this shit.This is one of the most heartbreaking photos I've ever seen.Wow. The most heroic thing I did today was smile at a dog.My wife responds that these kinds of calls about twice a week. Lately she has had her car spit on because of the immediate assumption that all cops are evil and want to shoot everyone. 

Yet she does stuff like you see in the photo for a living. Last week she went to two separate child deaths from crashes. Slightly different scenario but I want to give a shout out to one Officer Barcus, who helped distract me, a 28 year old graduate student, after I walked in and found my father had shot himself in the head at his house. As I was the only legal next of kin there (my mom was there but she was divorced from my dad) I had to wait for the Coroner to sign paperwork. On the worst day of my life, this cop talked to me, asked me about what I was studying, and basically kept me from just completely freaking out. This was 20 years ago. It's often the smallest things that make the biggest difference. Fuck this hits home. Medic here. I've had some truly heart wrenching calls. One of which was a father who had taken his young daughter quadding with him. Rolled his quad and broke his neck.  His daughter sat with him for close to three days if I remember correctly. She was 5 or 6. Kept telling us to be quiet because daddy was sleeping. 

I've never cried on call before, but how do you explain to a child that young that daddy isn't sleeping. Daddy is dead. 

I went home and hugged my sister that night.This isn't cop stuff, this isn't man stuff or dad stuff... This is fucking real people stuff. Real human shit.Sauce -
http://www.9news.com/story/news/traffic/2015/06/18/i-76-closed-due-to-crash/28926321/For all the horrific stories about cops killing people, I worked for many years as a civilian crisis worker for LEOs.  People often don't understand how police are exposed to horrific circumstances and emotions that are 'just part of the job.'  For all the WTF and watchpeopledie subreddits here, police often see this stuff first hand.  Crime and accident scenes attack all the senses-- decaying bodies are one thing, but even the smell of blood and gore indoors is something that cannot be described.  It is much more intense than just seeing a photo on reddit.

I dealt with three cases that still haunt me.

1-  A cop responded to a dead baby in a home.  A mother just had taken her newborn home, was exhausted, fell asleep, rolled over, and smothered her baby.  Later, after that situation was handled, the same cop was called out to the interstate where there was a report of a dead deer in the road.  The same mother had jumped from an overpass at night, and was basically just a stain on the asphalt.  That cop had a very bad shift.

2-  A dead baby at a day care.... I'll skip the details here, but going through a debrief with a bunch of weeping police officers was very intense.  

These stories never made the news.

The third story happened more than 10 years ago, and it is still being litigated, and has been in the national media.  I will skip the details other than to say it involved a horrific mutilation in a public bathroom.... and a hysterical, surviving mother.  Everyone attached to the case was deeply affected for years.  I had a first responder reach out to me this week---- years later, to discuss the case.

I have a close friend who was a homicide detective.  It sucks driving around town with her, since everywhere she goes she points out, we had a murder there, a shooting there, a suicide there, etc.

It seriously does something to people, and they tend to become desensitized to many things as a coping mechanism.  It taints their world view to be exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, and they deal with life and death (mostly unnecessary death) on a regular basis.  I am not a police apologist, as I find it horrible how police in the US have become militarized.  But there is a reason some cops treat everyone like animals.

What I find sad is that many police don't have what it takes to work effectively with the general public.  They may have had it at one point, but it can disappear.  The profession should do a better job at psych screening.  It isn't that different than the PTSD people/soldiers get in war zones.  Even the 'Barney Fifes' working in rural areas are seeing brutal killings of 80 year old women in meth related cases, or horrific issues of child neglect.Thanks for helping show the good cops, OP.I could never be a police officer.

Imagine that kind of shit just being part of your fucking day. Once they were done at that crash site, that officer holding the child had to go do fucking paperwork.

How could you possibly get on with your day after distracting a newly-orphaned little boy/girl from the sight of their dead parents a handful of metres away?

Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but when these issues crop up I always seem to think that they are deliberate to distract from some other policy they are pushing through. Think about it. You want to push through a controversial policy limiting freedoms? Simply announce that you are ""proposing internet tax."" Cause protests, all news focuses on that. Your policy/law change gets through without resistance from the country. You announce you will not tax internet.

Thanks to people like you I didn't just sit there waiting thinking about why I was there and what it was going to do to my future. Thank you.That's amazing.

My uncle was in hospital for a long time, and it was striking that the hospital in Scotland would spend so much money on fancy equipment, and nothing on small things which would improve the stay one-hundred fold.

An example: they had high-tech beds with televisions, and telephones, but they didn't have an engineering contract to service them, so noone could use them. My uncle was an engineer and planned to donate his services when he got out, but he never did. This is fantastic. I have always wanted to have this done at our nonprofit but never knew how to go about it. One day I will figure it out. Thank you for donating your time and doing this to help bring people a smile.

and the sequel, The H2Orror!I always get stressed when I see Louis C.K. eating with his twin too.https://youtu.be/9eb1qQnfs-Y?t=72This was surprisingly upsetting.

Flash forward a few decades and a renovation in that spot created a room that needed a window for Cleveland building code reasons. Now there is a window.Cleveland baby! Knew I recognized it, then zoomed in and was reassured. In the spirit of ""I want a god damn window"" I like to imagine the common office worker, coming in on a weekend with an appropriate rented saw and just did the hole himself, patched up a cheap window in there, cleaned up everything and came back on monday to his ordinary office, which is now the only one with a window.It almost looks like another building use to be attached to that one? Or could it just be a shadow... No biggie, that's just room 1408.  OSHA regs. That's the fire escape.Sniper perch.I knew that building looked familiar, Clevelander for life :3One of the cool things that gets glossed over about Cleveland is that each of the buildings are old enough to carry some history. It may not be the caliber that Europe has, but over 100 years of development and change isn't paltry either. 

One of the defining statements of major cities these days are skyscrapers. If you think about it skyscraper technology isn't that old, only exploding in the past 50 years or so. 50 years ago, Cleveland was a fully functioning, top 10 US city. There was really no need to build up a brand new huge building (and you couldn't really). Excluding a few buildings in NYC, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in the world for 20 years and the US for 30. 

Unfortunately by this time the companies and jobs that made up Cleveland were being moved elsewhere and any new developments were quickly cancelled. That combined with the invention that is the air conditioner and Cleveland slowly lost it's status. We were still a top 10 city in 1970 which wasn't *that* long ago.

Regarding these tourism videos, yes I am from Ohio and I do currently live in Cleveland (what makes you think I'm biased?). I remember when these videos came out and laughing at how spot on they were. To some extent they still are. HOWEVER. Things are looking up and a lot of new social places are opening up. We've getting back into the skyscraper phase with a nice hotel that'll hopefully be ready for the RNC (it will but nothing will work). And finally, if this nuCLEus project goes forward, it'll be interesting to see what else spawns from that. 

Will Cleveland ever return to status it used to have? No, least not in any reasonable time frame. It's cold and that's something we can't change and compete with. Cleveland does have a distinct advantage of not having to worry about natural disasters. So who knows, maybe in 300 years we'll be relevant again.I hope he's happy now, watching the world through his tiny little window.Plot twist, it's a broom closet.MedianerasMy dad used to know a guy that worked at the broadcast control room at the top of the CN Tower.  The room was all [concrete walls, blaring cooling fans, and TV signal displays.](http://www.roadwolf.ca/files/blogpics/CNTower/94538.jpg)  He said he was getting miserable, possibly S.A.D., from never seeing the sunlight.

So he asked management about installing a single porthole window.  He pressured them enough that they actually bothered to look into it, and they said it would cost $20,000, and that they were willing to pay for half if he paid for the other half.  Never did get the porthole installed.

Guy had some cool stories though.  Like [the Northeast Blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) - he said you could see the power rolling out from block to block - it didn't just all immediately shut off at once, it moved like a wave in the ocean.  Of course, he didn't have his camera.

He also got us in the CN Tower for free, through the basement security entrance, and we got to see the cool control room at the top of the tower that visitors can't see.

But also for an entirely different reason--realizing this is /r/pics and not /r/aerodynamics, anyone not interested in aerodynamics turn back, move along, nothing to see here...

This is the first visualization in the natural world (i.e., not in a wind tunnel) I've come across that illustrates adverse yaw, the use of differential aileron to correct it, and the effect it exerts on the tracking of ""wake"" or wing tip vortices.  As anyone who has spent time near a major airport knows, the little whirlwinds that stream off wing tips or edges of flaps--and which the **[newish winglets](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/24/business/Why-Winglets.html?_r=0)** try to combat--descend after the plane has passed and can make a crackling noise or disturb the tops of trees when they descend to ground level.

If the pilot is skimming above cloud tops as in this photo, those vortices will descend behind the plane and the combined **[""downwash""](https://tianyizf1.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/trailing-vortex.jpg)** from where the tip vortices meet will disturb the clouds--that's why we only see one ""slice"" caused by the two tip vortices in this image, but **[this photo](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/downwash.html)** of a business jet penetrating just the tops of the clouds illustrates the two separate wing tip vortices.

However, if you look closely, notice that, as the aircraft banks to the right, the slice is displaced to the outside of the turn, to the left of the aircraft track.  The reason for this is asymmetric induced drag--the downward deflecting aileron that raises the left wing tip causes a momentary increase in what is known as induced drag.  Simply said, banking to the right makes the left wing tip vortex stronger than its counterpart on the right.  The increased lift caused by the lowered aileron causes that wing to pull up and back harder than the right wing is ""pulled"" down, whose aileron is up.

That increase in drag would tend to pull the nose of the aircraft to the left, towards the outboard wing, which is a bad thing from an aerodynamics stand point--it requires more rudder to maintain coordinated flight, and thus, more drag to overcome, so higher fuel costs.  So a concept called **[differential aileron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/DifferentialAileron.svg)** is employed to cause the inboard (right) wing to raise the aileron more than the outboard (left) wing lowers its aileron.  But here's the key: the raised aileron results in more drag, but largely in the form of separation drag--that's when the air doesn't flow smoothly over the upper wing surface, but starts to get more turbulent.  This disruption in airflow causes more drag to be generated across the wing, but keeps the amount of outward **[spanwise flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:Tip_vortex_rollup.png)**on the upper wing surface lower. Spanwise flow is responsible for initiating wing tip vortices and winglets attempt to minimize it. The end effect is the generation of a smaller wing tip vortex on the inboard wing.

We're in the home stretch: when the two wing tip vortices combine, one stronger, the other weaker, their interaction causes the net downwash of airflow in the wake of the aircraft to track toward the stronger wing tip vortex, and thus as they descend, will veer to the outside of the turn.  Furthermore, the bank angle of the aircraft will accentuate this effect, as the lateral force component of the stronger wing tip vortex will bias the downwash to the outboard side. This is what we can see clearly from this otherwise picturesque, very cool shot.

**TL;DR: Perfect visualization of induced drag in a turning aircraft which biases the downwash to the outside of the turn.**

NOTE: For the pilots and perfectionists here, though the pilot eases up on the yoke/stick input that initiated the turn after the bank angle is established, a little bit of inboard bank input is held to prevent the natural stabilizing effect that aircraft with dihedral experience, which requires more lift on the outboard wing to counter the increased upward lift component on the inboard, more horizontal wing, which still results in a differential in induced drag between wingtips.  These changes in control surface input during turns are responsible when you see **[strake/LEX and wing tip vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:FA-18C_vapor_LEX_and_wingtip_1.jpg)** appear during airshow demonstrations more prevalently as hard turns are initiated, which then dissipate/disappear when the pilot establishes bank angle and/or unloads.BEWARE!

-Dr. Seuss, the Croc in the YardGators gonna gait.Interior crocodile alligatorI posted this elsewhere in the thread, but hey, maybe it won't get buried if I try again.

Lowcountry South Carolina checking in: the biggest risk we run with gators here is the idiotic tourists who come down and think they're cool to fuck around with. I've literally seen tourists on banks and docks casting fishing lines trying to hit the gator with their bait, to agitate it. And worse, I've seen (and stopped) tourists approaching a seven-footer to try and feed it *Chick-Fil-A nuggets.* 

The problem is, if it happens enough times, the alligator will get used to receiving food from people. And then they start to see people and think ""food!"" And then they start to approach people. And then they think, this person is holding out on me, being all coy backing away instead of giving me my chicken nuggets! And then they follow the person, who perceives it as aggression.

You can't relocate an alligator; they've fought other gators for the right to whatever territory they live in and they *will come back.* They will come back.

It *ruins* an alligator when they begin to feel comfortable associating with humans. I don't know of a single state that actually ""removes"" alligators--relocation doesn't work. Nine times out of ten, any pest control or park service you call will end up euthanizing any gator they've received a complaint about.

Here's a series of articles about a 50 year old gator who caused some ruckus in my town last June:

* First, someone saw him and complained. So he was removed.
* [Then he came back](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/03/3143848/whopper-gator-found-hilton-head.html) to his original location
* Someone complained that he was relocated rather than killed, so [an investigation started](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/04/3146663/large-alligators-release-to-be.html)
* A resident said that the gator [wasn't aggressive](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/07/3151999/hilton-head-islander-speaks-up.html)
* But the pest control guy lost his contract with the city anyway and the 50 year old, 1000 pound gator was killed.
* Some people [didn’t think the guy should’ve lost his job](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/09/3203948/petition-supporting-gator-wrangler.html)
* That's when things got really interesting. Another alligator was hit by a car on one of our busy highways in town. The city, having just terminated their contract with the-guy-who-handles-this-sort-of-thing, didn’t have anyone to go and pick it up. So, over the next few hours and in the ensuing traffic jam, all of our tourists and residents were treated to a delightful viewing of this alligator’s slow death in the median. [Article](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/03/3195631/maffo-critter-management-lose.html)


So, here are some tips for next time you see an alligator during your vacation:

* Respect them. Take photos from a respectable distance.
* Do not approach or harass them. They are not in a glass tank and they are not here to entertain you--you do not need to interact with them.
* Do not pick up, approach or harass their babies. Alligator moms actually do stick around their young and nurture them.
* Take care to look after your own young children and pets, as those are the most likely things an alligator will mistakenly see as food.
* Please don't call animal control just because you *see* a gator. Only call animal control if the animal is behaving in an aggressive way, or approaching humans. Gators who are minding their own business don't deserve to be euthanized just for existing.
* For the love of god, do not attempt to feed them chicken nuggets.So what's the legal standpoint of shooting one that's in your yard?[Alligators are some scary shit.](http://i.imgur.com/wY5BZ.gif)

/sorrynotsorryWindow seat is awesome. I can't even fall asleep on the plane ride because I'm too concentrated on staring out the window. Still fascinating no matter how many times I fly. 

The best ones are if the plane has a window exit. Fun fact, a lot of wide body aircraft say ""window exit"" but that seat actually has the window like 2-3 feet in front of the seat and maybe a foot behind it. So, tall people of reddit, make sure to ask if the exit seat actually has a window. Especially if you fly on a 777-300ER.

I am a geologist so I try to get a window seat to look at the familiar features on the ground in California, the San Andreas fault and the various ranges and structures one can see, especially when the sun angle is low. So I could see things like the Kettleman Anticline and the strike ridges of the Great Valley Sequence on the west side of San Jouquin Valley as we flew north. When we got about 20 min. out of Oakland the plane started to descend into the clouds and I thought that the show was over, but then I noticed a white colored bow that appeared opposite the sun in the clouds with a white spot in its center that I judged to be exactly opposite the sun which was low in the sky. As looked, and this lasted only a minute or so, I could see the shadow of the aircraft appear in the spot. Then we got deeper into the clouds and the effect was lost. I was seeing a glory and it may be reasonably common. I may have seen one years ago when I flew to Europe.

I'll wear them anyway just in case"" and then as I was working debris was  hitting me in the glasses and I thought ""those could be my eyes"" These cutoff discs are no joke.  They are designed to be used in a specific way (straight through cutting using the disc edge) but they are frequently used incorrectly (such as grinding using the face of the disc) which can lead to this sort of failure, with high speed shrapnel spraying in every direction.  Even if used properly, if you don't pay attention and the kerf closes on the blade, thus binding it up, you will get a rapid unplanned disassembly of the disc.

I'm actually  impressed with peoples increased awareness and use of safety glasses, hearing protection, helmets and other gear even if NOT required.  I mean, it's there to protect you.. and something you usually can't replace like an eye or brain.  

Still, there's always ""that guy"" who doesn't want to use any of it for [insert rather inane reason here].  As an M.D. they keep me in business, but I'd rather they didn't.  So remember kids, 15 seconds of putting on safety gear can save you a lifetime of injury.  Now you know.  And knowing is half the battle.   *oh, damn cartoons*Wow I have an angle grinder and I'll never use it without glasses ever again.

That's terrifying.Although I have no experience with cutting discs such as this, I do vividly recall a few years ago using a table saw for the first time. I did not have proper instruction nor did I review of how to use it, had a piece of wood kick back and hit me right in the stomach.

I don't play around with tools anymore, I rigidly stick to the safety instructions and refuse to use a tool without understanding it better first. Could have avoided a nice punch to the gut had I just taken 10 to 15 minutes that day. Could be a lot worse depending on the tool you're using.I work in a Cnc grind shop with few conventional machines and shit like this gives me nightmares.

- Can you control the thickness of the layer to a great degree?

- Does the hardened resin let you ""scrap off"" paint that you've laid down?  Either fresh or after it's dried? I've worked a bit with oil but I'm not sure how acrylic behaves exactly or how dense and hard the resin is for scraping.

- Please try [this!](http://i.imgur.com/M40mAQ0.gif) These stereographic images are easy as pie to make.  Just take two pictures of the same focal point on the piece, but a couple of millimetres apart (more or less, experiment a bit perhaps).

Visitors who don't know New York history sometimes assume it's all a carefully preserved green space from before the city existed, but that's not at all the case. Central Park was consciously conceived, laid out, and constructed beginning in the 1850s in response to the need for city-dwellers to have a place to ""escape"" to, and while it incorporated a few vacant spaces, much of it was reclaimed ground covered with temporary dwellings. Central Park is one of the great monuments to deliberate urban planning, most of it the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.

Edit: I'm not accusing OP of removing the watermark, but I do know it is in fact my friend's photo and would like to give her the credit she deserves. Help support her photography!

Edit 2: From /u/RunTheTrap

""She originally uploaded it to her National Geographic account here:

http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/photos/6577920/

It also was featured in this Editors' Spotlight post:

http://yourshotblog.nationalgeographic.com/post/128027447864/top-shot-the-great-divide-top-shot-features

She seems to have added the watermark on later, but it is her photo.""[Central park is just so awesome](http://www.christianross.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/central-park-from-above-nyc-satelatie-sky2.jpg) I got the impression from movies that Central Park is some tiny overcrowded and dimly lit patch of grass in the middle of a metropolitan, until I checked Google Maps. It's fucking *massive*.How much would it cost to rent one of those townhouse looking homes?Central park is much bigger than I realized. 
Edit: spelling... New York is a magnificent. Hi Everyone! I am Kayte Dolmatch - the photographer of this image. I'd like to clear a few things up:
1) This is my image and only my image
2) The very first time this was posted anywhere was on my flickr page with my watermark on November 20th 2014. https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaytedolmatch/15647565470/in/album-72157627317857063/ 
3) I submitted the photo to National Geographic in August of 2015 as part of an assignment ""From Above"". National Geographic prefers users to upload images without a watermark so I removed the watermark on the file I uploaded to their site.
4) To my pleasant surprise my image was voted Top Shot on National Geographic Your Shot - which meant it got ""published"" on their instagram and their blog (tumblr). This is the unwatermarked version that people have been stealing and posting all over the internet.
5)I have no problem with my image being circulated as long as the proper credit is provided - I'm so pleased that so many are touched by this photograph and really enjoy it.
6) I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark III, which allows the artist to record their name as the artist on every single image taken with the camera - this is captured in the metadata. Also seen on my flickr link
7)If you are interested in purchasing a print of this image please feel free to contact me at kathleendolmatch@yahoo.com
8) Thank you for reading this. Have a lovely day

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that ""stealing"" is not the correct term and I agree. ""Sharing without citing""  would have been more accurate. My image has gone viral on multiple websites without proper citation and I was frustrated when I made my original post. By the way, the apartment building in the center of the image with the gray gabled roof and green features is The Dakota, where John Lennon lived and was killed. Directly across in the park is an area called Strawberry Fields.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DakotaI miss my home :(Central Park is what makes Manhattan bearable, in my opinion.

It is the epitome of the need for escape from the urban cityscape and into the greenery, surrounded by two of my favourite museums, a one stop shop for getting away from the craziness that can be the city.Just went to central park for the first time yesterday. I found it to be an absolute gem among the massive concrete jungle that is NYC. The fact that they planned this over a
150 years ago and no one has either tried or been able to develop that land into more monstrous buildings is amazing. Central Park is probably my favorite place on Earth besides my bedJust a little fun fact, the lake in central park was originally a water reservoir for the NYC water supply. In Rio De Janiero, Christ the redeemer and the favelas have an interesting juxtaposition as well.So much beauty on the left. So much money on the right.I love to find  interesting buildings in New York. Look them up on google earth. Then look at the history behind them. How busy is Central Park on an average day? I cant imagine it supporting all those people...I love living in L.A. and I think it just might be one of the best cities in the world, but I wanna visit New York one day!  It seems like an awesome place to live !I really need to get to NY with my camera one day :(The demarcation is unbelievable. You can go in five minutes from being overrun by people to basically being alone in a forest. Ah, must be where the biome changes. Honestly, if you haven't been to New York yet, you should go just to visit.

As /u/and_what_army said then:

> This family has already been through hell. A child with seizures is hard enough, but by the time they go on a Keto diet it usually means traditional treatments have been exhausted and all the normal medicines (Banzel, Klonopin, Depakote, Diastat, Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, and probably others) don't work. Keto as a medical treatment is much harder than Keto for weight control. Fletcher probably had to go into the hospital for 2-3 days while he adjusted to being on the diet, and now everything that passes his lips must be weighed to the 1/10th gram. He probably can't even wear the wrong kind of sunscreen, because anything on the skin could affect the body chemistry for the Keto diet.I ordered a bag of glow-in-the-dark toys for kids who want them or who can't take candies. I also printed signs that read, ""**Toys available for kids with allergies. Shots available for adults with kids.**""

I spent more on Jameson and little plastic glasses than toys and candies, but it's probably a decent investment to build some goodwill for my first Halloween in the neighborhood.

Edit: Thank you, anonyperson, for the Gold. It's a real treat.My son does not have medical restrictions on his diet.

Nonetheless, I eat his candy.

Because I am a responsible parent who goes the extra mile.Here's what I do as a crazy irresponsible parent with a kid who is actually severely allergic to peanuts (I say actually because many people claim to be who aren't, seriously).  We go trick or treating and do not burden our neighbors with anything.  Fill up the bag with whatever!  Then when we get home we break out the safe treat bag and start the trading.  He couldn't care less because he doesn't know what he's missing and loves red-vines, skittles etc.  We can usually redistribute most of the unsafe candy back out to the remaining trick or treaters, and what is still left over goes to work with me (although it might not all make it further than my desk).

First lesson with allergies; it's on you to manage it.  I've had people actually say to him ""no it doesn't have peanuts in it, just peanut butter.""  He learned how to read ingredients at 5 and he's managed it pretty well.I had a step child with PKU and a child with other unrelated food allergies. Our solution was to let them go hog wild on Halloween and get as much candy as they could. I would then pay them $1/pound for the candy and we would go and buy a toy the following weekend. I'd take the candy to work and then I didn't have to worry about the kids sneaking candy they shouldn't have, they got to experience Halloween the same way as all the other kids, and they got a new toy. It seemed to work pretty well. Just a thought for parents who would like their kids to have the experience but don't have the time to send out nice fliers with attached toys.Plot development: One of the receiver of the letter bought an angry bird costume and introduced himself as Fletcher on halloweenThis is the kind of thing my cousins family would do. Ever since he was an infant he's been deathly allergic to a long list of things (walking past a boiling pot of wheat-based pasta once triggered an asthma attack from the vapour). 

The family didn't turn the house into a bubble, they didn't ban anything coming into the home. They just made a little sign on the door informing people that someone with severe allergies lives there and to please follow some basic steps to avoid any issues (they'd always mention it to a first-time visitor though). Simple things like ""Please wash your hands after eating or handling any food products"", having a cupboard strictly for his dishes and food, no perfume. 

*He* was taught to watch for things, wash his hands religiously, and to bring his own stuff (like popcorn to theatres, letting the staff know of the allergies), not to rely on other people who probably have no clue. He's nearly 20 now and still very much alive.

In many ways it's comparable to a disability. Yes society adapts to a point but it's really up to individuals to learn how to live with it.

(Edits for clarity...and spelling)Active vs. Passive parenting. Not trying to bash the other post, but *this* is how to properly handle your child's allergies/diet on Halloween.This doesn't belong to me, but the 'responsible' parent who posted about her kids peanut allergy pissed me off and reminded me of this awesome parent.

EDIT: Front page! thanks

EDIT: GOLD! Thanks!This could just be an elaborate ruse to find out ahead of time which houses to skip over in order to maximize the Halloween haul. 

My record is 5 1/2 large pillow cases loaded with candy within the 2 hour window, but this type of info could really help me out. After all, I turned 37 this year, and my legs aren't quite what they used to be.How irresponsible to name your child ""Fletcher.""With all the weirdos, allergies, and special diets out there these days, it's really a wonder that trick or treating even exists anymore. I have epilepsy and had to go through this same ordeal. However, instead of parents handing out toys, my parents just said I was too old to trick or treat.

Fucking kids these days. When I was a kid I *knew* how to get in troubleI threw a Halloween party at my house in college once, 300some people showed up (we had a big house and a big fenced in yard)  It was wild, DJs, bouncers, girls dancing on the bar, 3 floors of madness.  It was awesome.

Well at about 2am the cops showed up in full force expecting to have to chase down tons of underage drinkers and drug users.  Thankfully we prepared.  When the cops showed up we had the 2 ""bouncers"" greet them and texted us that it was time to break up the time. 

I got on the DJ's mic and told everyone that the cops were here and wanted the party to end, but they didn't want trouble.  So I urged everyone to NOT run, as it creates a panicky atmosphere where cops and students are freaking out.  

All the students left, no arrest or citations, and even though I was underage, the cops left us with a verbal warning.  The head officer then came to me, shook my hand, and said great party and thanks for ending it so calmly.

We got to party like animals for 5 hours and it had 0 negative outcomes.


*TL'DR - cops like a good party as much as the next guy, and thanked us for ending it when they asked in a responsible manner*I love being Canadian.Why couldn't they just let them turn down their music? This is actually amazing.In high school my friends and I threw a graduation party with no alcohol. All the partiers were either in some music department or taking AP classes and headed to college next fall. 

We had the cops come into the backyard because of noise complaints/possible drinking/typical suburban problems. The first conversation they heard was about Cello and what it takes to play at a collegiate level between me and my friend. 

Literally the words the cops said to us were, ""oh we can see you kids are  having fun, try to keep it down your neighbors are worried."" 

That was a fun summer. memories. [Expectation](http://i.imgur.com/DyO8lrw.jpg)

Party on.These guys need to step their game up for next time.

Like, throw another party, have the music bumping loud enough for the neighbors to get bothered by the bass, and get the cops called again.

While it is very beautiful and sweet smelling, its has the ability to escape its ornamental confines in vine form, and then establish itself in the wild, where its aggressive vines creep around the forest floor, choking and out-competing many native understory species. Furthermore, sizable trees have been killed by those creeping Wisteria vines. When these large trees are killed, it opens the forest floor to sunlight, which allows the Wisteria seedlings to grow and flourish even more. 

Also, anyone who wants to see a good list of invasive species that are often sold at garden centers you should *definitely* avoid planting in your yard (depending on your zone), see [THIS LIST](http://imgur.com/a/PCLez) I made. If anyone DOES want to plant Wisteria, I would recommend [American Wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria_frutescens), which is just as beautiful, but does not have the invasive predisposition the Asian varieties do. The reason the Asian varieties are favored in ornamental application is because they emit a very intoxicating fragrance, while American Wisteria does not.

Edit: clarity

I kill everything indoors. The only things to survive me so far are snake plants. I ordered seeds for this on amazon. After a few weeks I got a notice that they had been confiscated.  

Edit:  I gave no indication of wanting to grow a bonsai with them. I'm aware seedlings aren't appropriate for bonsai. I did not know they were invasive when I tried to purchase them, now I do.

ITT: Michiganders and slightly confused and disgruntled New Yorkers>Coney Islands are a unique type of Greek American restaurant. Two of the most well-known Coney Island restaurants are the Lafayette Coney Island and the American Coney Island, which are located adjacent to one another on Lafayette St. in downtown Detroit. They have a common root, with the original restaurant having been established by Greek immigrant brothers Bill and Gus Keros in 1914. The brothers got into business dispute soon thereafter, and in 1917 split their restaurant into the two establishments that exist today.

>The menu of all Coney Island restaurants centers on the Coney Island hot dog, which is a natural casing hot dog in a steamed bun dressed with chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard. This item is usually referred to simply as a ""coney."" Another popular item on most Coney Island restaurant menus is the ""loose hamburger,"" which consists of crumbled ground beef in a hot dog bun, covered in the same condiments as a Coney Island hot dog. Many Coney Islands also serve ""chili fries,"" which are french fries covered in chili, sometimes with mustard or cheese added.

>Many Coney Islands offer other Greek and Greek-American dishes, such as Gyros, Souvlaki, Shish Kebab, Spanakopita, Saganaki, and Greek salads, as well as usual American diner fare, such as regular hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, and desserts.

TILThis is the place at 6 and Haggerty, right?ITT: Coney 2015You have a Coney Island?From Michigan, outside of Detroit, still blows me away no one else in the world knows what a coney island is. This place runs on Coney Islands.

Edit: Glad to hear these are popping up elsewhere. I'm just used to puzzled looks when I mention a coney outside of the areaI'm so excited to see a post about Coney's on the front page! Also so cool to see the interest from non-Michiganders. I grew up in the Detroit area where they are everywhere however I'm in Lansing now and there are only a few.

The most important things a coney must have, to me, are as follows:

1. You can get both Detroit and Flint style.
2. The place is a little gritty (which is why I prefer Lafayette over American, the atmosphere in there is amazing)
3. Someone working there has to be speaking (or yelling) Greek. If they are, you know the place is legit.
4. Bonus points if they have Vernor's and Boston Coolers (basically a ginger ale ice cream float)
5. Saganaki is always a bonus (OPPA!)

Cheers to all my fellow coney  connoisseurs![deleted]I just talked to the owner of this restaurant for a news story about this. What a sweet man! He told me that he lived on a farm in Greece with seven brothers and sisters, and his parents couldn't afford to send him to school. He left home when he was 12 and went to Athens, where he was homeless, and depended on the kindness of others to give him food. He said he does this every year because ""It makes my heart feel good to do it, and help a little bit."" This has to be metro Detroit. Not aware of any other place on earth with Coneys. [deleted]This guy understands real life. Good job Coney Island guy.**#Coney2015**""...my local Coney Island""?

As a New Yorker, this is confusing. That's really nice and all. But I am a national Coney Island man. Give me a hani and cheese fries as my last meal. And the answer to the big question is Lafayette. I'm thinking of going... I have no kitchen and everyone else is working that day.I need this where I live. Hate getting whatever fast food is open and being ""that"" guy.If I can marry this restaurant I would in a heartbeat!Sounds better than spending it with my familyThe worst part of leaving the Detroit area was giving up coney islands.Holy shit I miss Coney Island, didn't realize how much until I saw this. I'm originally from NY but I lived in Detroit for four years; this was the go to place. I actually just got chills from reading that sign.

I mean it has very nice seating, but that is about it.

The tv and the projector screen are rather small, there are skylights and these strange candles in the front. It might be some sort of stage or chapel or something. It looks more like some place where someone would give a sales pitch about some amazing multi-level marketing opportunity or a sermon about how much god wants you to give the preacher money.http://i.imgur.com/GhFBRxh.gifThat is AWFUL.

Ridiculousthe skylights weren't a good choice either.I see a pull down projector screen.

I wouldn't blame him if it were the latter. After all, the transfusion of young blood into an old body has rejuvenating effects, if the lab mice are to be believed. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a hidden market of ""blood ministration"" that certain individuals keep secret.

Our teams were really tiny, only 5 or 6 people a project, but when you have multiple people animating on a film, all with their own distinct styles and artistic background, it's pretty easy for inconsistencies to happen unless you really peg things down! 

Even in a small team like ours, the style guide basically became like our bible during the project, I can't imagine what it'd be like in larger teams, if style guides weren't there! I love seeing ones from other series though, some of the do's and don't's are really interesting, things you wouldn't notice/think about otherwise It takes a little while to hammer out all these kinks and standardize the art style across the animation team. If you want to see an example of some of these errors in play, check out the first season of Family Guy, there are a few errors, but one that immediately comes to mind is the cutaway where Peter thinks Philadelphia with Tom Hanks is a comedy. When the POV switches from zoomed out to closeup, someone didnt scale the eyes correctly, so for a part of the scene Peter's eyes are huge As an animator, seeing everyone's reaction to something that is super common in the industry is cool. It's like ""oh ya, what I do is pretty cool""I played around with the image to see what was written on the back. Here are my results (someone more skilled would do better):

that secret door doesn't look so secretDidn't realize the wooden floor looked like that. All you ever see in photos is the carpet with the presidential seal.

Is this done for cleaning, or what? Because every president since Kennedy has used the same desk and carpet.

EDIT: speelingAs a flooring installer I'm getting a bit horny looking at that floor.Looks like tiny workers on the floorif those walls could talk Does anyone know what the various holes in the floor is for? My first guess is that they're recessed electrical outlets and the like, but I might be wrong.As a former contractor, fuck whoever decided right angles are not important.Those floors are so nice. Why cover them up with all of those rugs and stuff?Is that the door to Leo McGarys office?I give it 3 days before this ends up on my Facebook feed posted by an idiot cousin with something about ""Arrest Obama"".Black guy getting evicted steals everything not nailed down.

then for the next 20 or 25 years we don't change too drastically..  

Then we start to change a lot again as we enter the end of life years 50-75.  It's not just he presidents, it's most people, except those strange freaks who seem to never age..

Obama was a great president and I'm glad I voted for him.You mean... Somebody would use a meme to mislead people?Here's how he could look if he dyed his hair. 

http://imgur.com/CgtqHamNaw look! He was smiling in the first photo, and now he has his mouth open. Being the president sucked all the joy and life out of him and crushed his will to be happy forever /sHe looks a bit skinnier now.Anyone else amazed with how fast time has gone by? I remember him being elected as if it were yesterday... 8 years.. Goddamn.I would bang. Being president ages a person. Look at before and after pics of any of them. Looks the same. George Ws hair actually got darker for a bit after he left office.You may notice the vein on the side on his temples has become much more pronounced. Along with the obvious graying of the hair. I guess being the leader of the free world will do that.The microphone looks good, perkier even.That man has seen some shit...aliens?Can someone share a pair of pics of themselves now and 8 years ago to see the normal rate of growth.thank you, that other picture was pissing me off.  It's was like a before and after infomercial where they have terrible lighting on the beforeEven this picture is giving a false impression, albeit the opposite one in so far as it tries to make him look older in the before picture. The picture of him when he was younger has him smiling widely which of course creates wrinkles and lines as the muscles of his face contract. This lessons the impact of any permanent lines on his older picture. 
  
TL;DR A better comparison would have the same facial expression in both and no wide smiles. TIL people ageHe was greying a bit in the first, and then 8 years later he is even more grey. Hmmmmm. How the hell?Wasn't your mole on the other side...?

She was so funny. I'll miss her. This picture makes me happy! I'm glad she has people that care for her. 

Edit: My highest rated comment by FAR.If you wanted I bet you could find someone to photoshop that bag off her knee - I dont mean to imply that it's bad, just if you wanted it gone I've seen some great photoshop jobs here on reddit. 

awesome picture tho, I hope she's currently as comfortable as possible. Good on you for doing this for your grandma OP, the smile on her face is proof how much she appreciates you doing this for her.

As a nurse I work with a lot of patients who are terminally ill and frequently I'll ask them what were the most memorable moments in their life. 9/10 times people will mention family or memorable moments like these. Never once have I had a patient mention money or personal possessions as the highlight of their life. It's the little things in life that matters, make them count.The most simple pleasures of life can mean a lot to some. Doctor here. This is the way it should be. Dying with dignity versus the medical torture we sometimes use to prolong the inevitable. Love the joy on her face. Congratulations to her for a long life. This is such a touching pic.  It brought both tears to my eyes as well as happiness seeing that smile on her face.  She looks like the Grandma everyone would want around them.  Sending big hugs to you and your gram.Wat.When my uncle came home from hospital to die (he didn't want to stay in the hospice, so his wife and my mother cared for him during his final 3 weeks. His bed was set up in the sitting room, his view out the window was onto the mountain range in our area. He woke up to the sun rising every morning over it. During the day and in the evenings his bed was wheeled out into the kitchen so he could be there with his family and be beside the stove. He could lie there and look out the double doors onto the bay. The view from the kitchen over the bay is unbelievable, many people at the funeral in the house were amazed at it. 
Before his remains left the house to go to the church we faced him towards the sea one last time. Something I believe would have put a smile on his face. Happy watFuck yeah grandson! Not only are you sharing that fantastic day with her, and making her final desires a reality, you are there. And her face shows the joy and wonder of the setting and experience with you! 

To this day I regret missing my stepfathers final days, due to work commitments and travel constraints. All in all bullshit rationalizations. I just missed his death by @ 6 hours. Regret not being there just to say goodbye, hold his hand and thank him for everything he was to me. So kudos, it's hard to watch it happen, but being there for our loved ones is soul work. It is our responsibility and great honor to help them pass from this world to...

Edit: For assumptions about OP's gender!Is this San Diego?

As someone who works in SD in some palliative/ home hospice care settings please listen to me when I say

You're all doing the right thing for her. HOSPICE DOES NOT MEAN YOURE GIVING UP ON SOMEONE. 

Edit: a wordHer joy is breathtaking. I have never loved a photo as much as I love this one!This totally looks like Laguna Beach. We need closure, op!I hope you grandma goes peacefully, remembering wonderful moments like this one.My G'ma knew her time was near and wouldn't my wedding so I made her her favourite dinner and proposed to my wife in front of her so she could be a part of our wedding [Dignity](http://i.imgur.com/XGIr4do.jpg)This made my heart smileI love this so much.

It's not all bad though, the area is being regenerated and there's new housing and a new school now.It's a great shame to see communities like this lost from towns and cities across England but unfortunately it's a result of the times we live in. 

I live in Liverpool City centre and a comparison of the city centre 39 years ago and how it is today would produce an equally surprising yet positive contrasting image. The city Centre is amazing and is a credit to the hard work done by Liverpool City council.

NeatIce....

They'd have a sack of methane or some gas in their stomach which they would spark with a specialized lighter-like organ in their throat that would allow it to breathe fire.

http://i.imgur.com/SHUEeBq.jpg""each slice sold for $5000? Jesus, it's just glass! Slap an art tag on a pile of shit and I could sell it I bet!""

*opens link*

""oh.. Yeah, 5k sounds fair.""Every time I read a description about an art form I always think- ""cool something for me to try""
I have to pretend I never saw this nowProfessional glass artist here. This is how it's made:

The artist will pull very long strands of glass in all the colors that required for the picture he wants to make. They then arrange the long strands of glass into say a face or a foot or something. then melt them all together and pull that very long again. Then you can take the face you made and add that 'face' strand to a whole bunch of other strands to make an overall picture.

tldr: it's just like using one pixel at a time to make up the whole image.[deleted]Yeah yeah yeah that's real neat and all but you can't even smoke weed out of it.  Fantastic stuff! I love this.Cut it thinIs there a discount for the end piece?how do they slice this?Calling these things slices makes me want to eat one.If you're interested in glass art, there are two really good subreddits for it. /r/glassheads and /r/lampwork are both full of amazing glass art, artisits, and a copious amount of knowledgeable people in the art.In the future, the one who can collect all the pieces and join them together will be granted a wish. Glassloaf Z!When you slice the loaf, you can make a Strata-cut animation. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH42WFUNwfY) is an example.

Interesting.Note to self: find a desert map for Cities Skyline.Those look to be the upper middle class suburbs, they tend to be on the outskirts of Vegas away from the strip since they overlook the desert mountains. High schools get built onto empty dirt lots and homes surround the area. Unfortunately, most of these homes get built around the outer edges more and more each year with less and less people buying them out. I'm only 23 and most of my friends have been able to *buy* these homes at this age from how cheap they are. I'm a Vegas Native and I can safely say this is only a specific view of suburban Vegas life. I'd even say Vegas has many different kinds of suburban looks since the city keeps growing immensely every year.

*edit from mobile* so thanks to savvy Vegas friends below this has been identified as the Aliante portion of Vegas, which is definitely a way nicer suburb of Vegas.

[deleted]Lots of comments from people saying Vegas sucks. I've been out here 10 years. It's fine. Every city sucks if you're looking for reasons for it to. It's just like any other place. Many of the complaints apply to any major city. Drivers suck, drug problems, crime, people are ""fake"" blah blah blah. I don't drink, do drugs, party, etc anymore. I have a decent career and life out here in this ""party town"". It's all about how you look at it. I think the desert is beautiful. Yeah, it gets hot as hell. It's a desert. We also don't have to shovel snow. This winter was cold for like a week in late December. Other than that, nothing more than a light jacket was ever needed. 

All of that being said, don't raise kids here unless you can put them in private school. Clark County schools are atrocious. Even if they graduate high school (~30% won't), the curriculum is so weak that they will still be at a disadvantage. Especially in an out of state university.

I have desert landscaping. Grass is dumb in the desert. Even outside of being a waste of water and contributing to the humidity, it just doesn't look right in the middle of the desert. I sure as shit don't want to be outside cutting the grass when it's 115 degrees out.This looks exactly like the homes in Las Ventura's in San Andreas in GTA: San Andreas.I live there.

I would rather grow up there than my own city.

Imagine being an 8-14 year old kid there with a giant desert behind your house to explore, build bike trails, jumps and just wander.

also there is an airport near on the bottom left corner to watch planes land and take off.

Then at 16 with a summer job and saving up allowances I'd get a small dirtbike to tour around in the desert.

I was once employed by DirecTV, which claims exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package. Each year, the top seller of the Sunday Ticket package in each DirecTV call center was given some recognition and award by the NFL. It so happens that a friend of mine (Jason) won for our call center and the prize for that year was to fly out for a weekend trip on location for the filming of an advertisement for Sunday Ticket.  Mr. Manning was being featured in the ad and all of the award recipients and their guests were to do a meet and greet with him during filming. I asked Jason if he would be willing to take a football card and have it signed, to which he agreed.

When Jason returned from the trip, he presented me with the signed card (personalized to me) and told me about his meeting with Mr. Manning. He said there were something like twenty people that had gone on the trip, and that Mr. Manning had apparently requested small bios of all of those who we're coming to the meet and greet. When they arrived, he addressed each of them by name and talked with every one of them personally about their lives and thanked them all for their efforts to help market the NFL, etc. He also joked around with all of them while he was filming the ad and was just generally very personable and great.

Since having learned about the events of that trip, I have always had a high opinion of Mr. Manning, feeling that his treatment of those in attendance was far above what many players would offer in a similar circumstance.

TL;DR - Peyton Manning treats a bunch of fans very well during a meet and greet.I like that he took the time to fill in the ""r"" in ""Mr"" before his signature.When PM was in his final year in Indy during the injury season, some family friends would see him before the game pull into the players lot in his car before the game as they tailgated across from the entrance. (One time he even rolled down his window and jokingly asked for a hotdog.)

During the final home game of the year, after seeing the same die hard group there through every game in that season where the Colts went 2-14, he approached the group before the game unsolicited and thanked them for their support during the long year and posed with some pictures at their tailgate spot.

He will always be my favorite athlete of all time, and even though we are set up better for the future with Andrew Luck, I miss Peyton every time I see him play.I'm pretty sure Ryan Leaf is available.Plot twist: OP's sister's fiancee is Eli Manning.Peyton is all class.What an idiot.

Where in California is this again?Nice mosquito trench.It looks a bit like a rain garden. The function of a rain garden is to increase infiltration rates and prevent runoff. They can also act to filter out pollutants. It's hard to tell by this angle but it looks like the intent is not to just run water from the downspouts to the pavement. 

Overall I like it. It probably helps reduce runoff and increase water infiltration. We should all build these in our yards to improve the water quality of our streams and rivers. Could use more deep rooted plants in it to make it better. 

Also as a side note, the city I live in will reimburse half the costs of a rain garden up to a certain amount. I bet many other towns do the same and few people know it.

Skunks, at least here in my part of Texas, are the number one carrier of rabies. As many as 2/3rds of skunks tested return positive results. It's not likely the baby has it, but it is possible. It's spread through the saliva and mother animals tend to clean their young with their tongues so while unlikely, it CAN be spread without requiring a bite or scratch.

The virus likely wouldn't survive long on the baby's fur but I'd still exercise caution. Wash your hands thoroughly. Don't rub your eyes or pick your nose. This is assuming you made sure you had no open cuts on your hand before handling it.

Baby skunks are kind of case-by-case when it comes to spraying. Some of them won't do it at all while others will lift their tails and spin around like a garden sprinkler. Approached carefully, most skunks won't even spray.

If you notify your local animal control agency, just a heads up, they'll very possibly treat this as an exposure and, for your own safety, euthanize the skunk and submit it to be tested for rabies.

My girlfriend took a picture of a [shockingly similar rainbow this afternoon](http://i.imgur.com/bB35ZuL.png), too. 

I guess rainbows probably look a like, but a complete arch rainbow is hard to come by.

edit: OP lives in Sioux Falls. I live in Brookings. We're an hour away from each other. I knew I fucking recognized that rainbow.Good yard./r/itookapicture would like this. Just say you took a picture of your daughter though. try /r/redditgetsdrawnSouth Africa? ""Daddy, I don't wanna take a picture""

There will be a time when she's grown a bit older, and there will be this vague memory in her head, floating around in bits and pieces of nostalgia as memories do when we no longer need them - there was a rainbow, and beautiful clouds, and it had rained, and I was in my pajamas for some reason - and you will show her this photograph. And she'll be happy to see some affirmation of this memory's existence in time, a photograph somehow as beautiful as the memory itself. Beautiful. GET TO THE CHOPPAReal solid framing of your daughter under the rainbows! The perspective distortion from the wide-angle lens makes her look giant against the trees in the background. Good use of the reflective wet pavement too. Colors are a bit too yellow in the skin tones and trees, even for a the warm tones of a sunset (assumed).

Very strong pose and expression, very dynamic.

On top of that, this is a great photo of someone you care about, so overall this is excellent.brb, Your daughter is about to lead us on some sort of quest and I should probably pack a toothbrush or something.http://mastersofnothing.ytmnd.com/You aren't happy she didn't listen, more like you are happy you were able to take that pic.Parents don't let their kids go outside barefoot now?good pic, horrific titlegore","[0.549523, 0.064494, 0.113925, 0.276543, 0.089926, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.137, 0.148, 0.852, 0.9, 0.783]"

Some of our best politicians wouldn't be elected today because voters somehow confuse looking like a respectable politician with actually being a respectable politician.make fun of it all you want, but we do just fine without the fake idiots who can barely pull off pretending to care about what the people want/need. somehow, even with all the crazies, we do pretty well. we're a pretty progressive place, have the first city powered entirely from renewable resources, and we're pretty decent as far as civil liberties go. i think most other state debates are much more of a joke, even though the people look more serious. Looks about right for a VT gubernatorial race.  From left to right:  Jerry Garcia in hiding, rich woman there to look at leaves, career politician, guy who moved to VT for gun rights, another career politician, housewife with no practical experience who thinks they need to get the ""Washington insiders"" out of Montpelier, and a car salesman.

What was the advantage to this style of building?I'm so confused right now. I don't know if the whole thing is flat and jut painted (including the brick columns and the illusion of the blanket as if it was over the facade), if the brick columns are real, if there is indeed a flat cardboard only everything on it (the nails and everything) is just painted, or if they actually peeled off the brick layer and this came out. Damn you talented artists, you have made me doubt reality again. wow that is some of the best Trompe-l'œil I've ever seen and on that sort of scale too.

My mom used to try to paint certain things in the same style and it looked good but never to that extentThis is gorgeous. The gooderham building! interestingly it has a triangular shape and is older then the Flatiron in New YorkI've been telling my wife that we should go to Toronto...

Legit question: 

How does lightning strike from a volcano cloud? I've only ever seen lightning in the clouds from the sky, before, so this is a new concept to me. How am I supposed to get all the way up there with just this stupid ring and my stupid midget buddies?

""Who disturbs my slumber?""Shit like this is why ancient civilizations believed in cool gods.OMG I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

Okay, fun fact about Venus, the atmosphere is to thick and hot for rain, so when it rains sulfuric acid on venus it evaporates a few km above the surface.

But there is lightning? Lightning on earth comes with rainstorms, but the lack of rainstorms on venus means that the lightning  comes from the volcanic ash buildup in the atmosphere.This is WILD. High quality pics post right here. Quetzalcoatl returnsHolly shit!!! I never thought I'd see something from my hometown on reddit. I use to live less than 10 miles from this volcano.

Am I saying that right?'Guys, I said, *don't* let the avatar get on top of the mountain!'When I visit *la familia*, this volcano is visible from the *Capilla* which sits on the road which leads down to the village.

Do you any original characters you have come up with? 



is there a rule against impromptu ama-ing someone? This is beyond awesome. Having an original drawing like that would surely embiggen the smallest man.

He also does little things like this. Most of his life he worked on Hey Arnold and Spongebob, so it's more often that he will be asked to draw one of those than a Simpson's character. He's from a small town in Virginia, so whenever we visit, everyone crowds him in public hoping for a personalized drawing. He's like a local celebrity! He also does little doodles for my roommates and friends for their birthdays. It's such a fun skill to have!I wish I knew how to go be an animator,  it's my dream career.

It will be reposted to facebook next week and my mom will show it to me next month. Can anyone figure out how he got in that position? Perpendicular to two parallel semis? As a former firefighter I have seen people live through much worse. I don't have pictures to prove it but it is weird how some people can survive crazy shit. The majority of them where not in great shape but they did live.

The one that I remember most though is a drunk that hit a mini-van head on. This was back in 1989 and the guys head punched through the windshield. The Sgt. went to support his neck and his fingers slid inside his throat. Took us all back for a few seconds and then we went back to the rescue.

Once we removed the dash both of his legs where facing towards his torso and through all this, he was breathing. Not with it, but alive.

He survived though.Like a good neighbor, state farm is therrreee..... with a hacksawhttp://i.imgur.com/ds7nimr.gifvDoes anyone else find it unsettling that there is a skull like face embedded into the crumpled frame just to the right of his face?!So this is actually my cousin, just got off the phone with him. He was coming back from a business trip in Oregon (he's a farmer in Washington) when this happened. According to him there semis in front of him hit black ice, and he then slid into them, crushing him like this. His airbag didn't go off (luckily) and he said he had about 1 ft. of room to move around in. He was able to get out of the car after about 30 minutes. Although he says he only has a couple cuts and a bruise near his eye, he did go to the hospital where he was checked out and everything was fine. He's now happy to be home with his son and pregnant wife.

As much as I thought we had it bad for weather, SD was just ridiculous. It gets hotter in the summer, colder in the winter, and the storms (winter and summer) are wilder. Snow plows running every week, signs getting blown off buildings, flickering lights, snowing in October and May, rain clouds that looked like armageddon. They were beautiful, though. Like the people from Independence Day looking up at those ships in awe as the beam gradually forms and decimates everything.As a South Dakotan I love whenever my state gets some attention everyone from there likes to jump in and chime Oooh Im from South Dakota!

The midwest is a terrifyingly beautiful part of America.I have experienced one of these South Dakota summer storms, probably around about this time of year, too. We were camping in Badlands NP. Temps had reached 116 that day, too hot and humid to move. That night, the bellowing wind bent the tent sideways; after we'd held it up from the inside for what seemed like an hour, we made a run for the car, sleeping bags in tow. From there we were witness to an almighty thunderstorm, lightning striking all over the visible sky, as a backdrop of 80s rock songs played on the car radio. The storm finally passed around 6am, and we returned wearily to our tent, which had somehow survived. It was terrifying at the time, but made for an amazing adventure for two Brits not used to such monumental storms! We loved our time in and around the Black Hills.*What a glorious day!*Yay!

Original photo by John Vachon, a photographer of the Farm Security Administration.

[""Negro tenant farmer, rehabilitation client. Jefferson County, Kansas"", 1938.](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1997003700/PP/)


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration):


>Initially created as the Resettlement Administration (RA) in 1935 as part of the New Deal in the United States, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was an effort during the Depression to combat American rural poverty.


>The FSA stressed ""rural rehabilitation"" efforts to improve the lifestyle of sharecroppers, tenants, very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture — that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.
Fallout looking motherfucker.It somebow bring the distant past into the present. Awesome work. Does anyone know a good online repository for such work? Jefferson County, KS has an average annual rainfall of ~38 inches. In 1938, they got 10.5"". I seriously doubt it was this green. It was called the ""dustbowl"" for a reason.

I expected something else[Source](https://500px.com/photo/105244145/fuji!-by-daniel-kordan) and /r/japanpics if you want to take a look.For anyone feeling inspired to go to Japan, I've gone twice so let me make it concrete for ya.

**Flights:** Flights can be, at best, around 600 USD round trip. United ran a special for this cost. Often you'll find a round trip for about 1200 USD (this is my experience flying from SFO in the bay area). Use [itasoftware](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) to search for flights. Also google around for deals.

Alternatively, look into acquiring mileage points through credit card usage and flying for free. 

**Room:** On my second visit I stayed in a hostel called [Khaosan Kabuki](http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/en/kabuki/) for about 35 a night. You can get free room if you volunteer to clean. 

Many hostels are similarly priced / have similar volunteer benefits. 

Let me clarify that a ""hostel"" is not as shady as it connotes. The place I stayed was as clean as any hotel I've been to.

Capsule Hotels are also cheap and somewhat of an experience. 

**Food:** Food in Japan is like food anywhere. There's cheap stuff (less than 10) decent stuff (10-25) and expensive (30-100's). 

You can have a very enjoyable trip eating for less than 10 a meal although I suggest splurging once or twice because Japan does have amazing food to offer. The best value / quality for sushi I've heard of and had myself is a place called [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/index.html).

There's no tipping either which is amazing as I'm from the U.S. and any $10 meal was actually $10.

**Sights / Activities:** This is far more flexible depending on the kind of person you are. I spent most of my time walking around which is free.  I recommend at least 1 planned activity that's unique to Japan and new to you (Karaoke, Onsen, traditional breakfast, etc). 

**Language Barrier:** Japanese people are some of the most courteous and kind people in the world. Culture reasons. One of the things that stands out on my first trip was a mob of people *standing on the right side of an escalator and letting walkers through on the left. No one broke this rule.* 

English is pretty prevalent in Japan, especially the cities. In fact there's a Starbucks in the Shibuya Crossing which is a hugely popular spot and a KFC nearby. Western influence abounds.

People are mostly happy to try and communicate with you. But yes, it's scary to engage with someone who doesn't speak your language. 

**Story Time:** I was with my friend Matt (who had actually just finished traveling east from Florida... long way around the world). We had a ""sushi day"" where we decided to get expensive sushi lunch and dinner in the same day.

For lunch, we visited [Kyubei](http://www.kyubey.jp/). Our reservation was made by our Hostel staff (which is something they are always willing to help with). I'm assuming they acknowledged we were English speaking and we were sat with a chef who spoke enough English. 

For dinner, we visited the [highest-rated sushi place on Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066854-d1692134-Reviews-Sushiryori_Inose-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html). After an awesome sushi course, we were sitting alone in their shop. It was cold outside. The sushi chef spoke ""O-sake?"" offering us some sake. 

Well, we ended up sitting with them for almost two more hours drinking sake and bumbling our way through communication. I learned their son is a model in magazines. They pulled out a giant map of the world and my friend Matt showed them where he had been. They like California Cabernet wine. The wife played some Michael Jackson on her phone and did an impersonation. 

Points here are that people want to connect with you and Japan is pretty accepting of English.

We even had a bus driver yelling at us on a bus full of Japanese passengers. Turns out we missed our stop (I had mentioned it to him before getting on). He literally stopped the bus, motioned for us to get out, and pointed us in the right direction. It was embarrassing and stressful unlike the previous sushi dinners. Point here is that there will be moments where it's not roses.

All in all you could do Japan on 2k easily. If you pull a flight deal or a free flight through miles it'll be even cheaper.Ok, I will be that guy.
