I'm guessing this tree is the quest objective.
This was taken by Andy Goldsworthy. He has some really amazing pictures, so I highly suggest you check them out!

As a former MMO player I feel like i need to kill 10 of those trees and go talk to someone.
I couldn't imagine being on LSD walking through the woods and coming across something like this.
You're never bored on adderall, amiright?

Maybe they used scissors on the leaves near the roots http://i.imgur.com/qJOL8Ta.jpeg
If life has taught me anything I can harvest this for resources.
And the slightest breeze comes along and ruins all your work.

You know it's really good when it looks like bad photoshop.
That tree is part of the current quest
Looks like the river of light from Mushishi
This is probably either by or inspired by Andy Goldsworthy.  He does stuff similar to this out of things like leaves, rocks, twigs, even icicles.  He's even credited as the founder of modern rock balancing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Goldsworthy

Edit: This is in fact an Andy Goldsworthy piece titled "Sycamore leaves edging the roots of a sycamore tree" - http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/mud-paintings-icicle-sculptures-and-more-temporary-nature-art
Almost looks like a bad photoshop. But nice work!

Is it known where the first 6 seconds of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQwRMGa4jsU&bpctr=1439675049) was filmed?

EDIT: First video taken down, [here is the video i was talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbvZNy7Bmw)
I worry more about airborne debris than I do about a pressure wave.    My dad was a maintenance foreman at a refinery for many years.  They had just got on site when a grain elevator about 3/4 mile away exploded.  Not your normal little sheet metal silo, but a huge concrete structure on the ship channel.  They saw it go and could feel the heat on their skin.  One of dad's crew yelled "Take cover!" and they scuttled behind the cracking tower they were going to work on that day.  Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet.
How deep does it go?
So does anyone know why caused that massive explosion? 
Knowing my luck, i bet those tar filters i ordered from China last week were in one of those shipping containers.
Only 50 people died? How many were vaporized?
is there a before picture?
That was the largest explosion I've seen that isn't a nuke.  I don't even think a MOAB is that big.
To give you another unbelievable indication of the explosions scale, here is a "before" picture of the exact area affected from Google Earth.  The red circle is the now water-filled crater, the yellow is the area substantially destroyed by the blast.

http://i.imgur.com/JvmXti5.jpg


It kind of looks like the crater is filled with water --does anyone know? It's difficult to see the depth of the crater.
Thank God the explosion happened in that giant crater
Is that how it's going to be remembered from now on?  The Tianjin Crater.  Just level the ground around it and abandon the land or turn it into a park of something.  

I lived close by to a massive explosion that happened in Quebec.  [The McMasterville Explosion 1975](http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/faits_divers/clips/12049/).  That too made a huge crater in the ground and levelled an entire factory complex that belonged to CIL.  The remaining factory was demolished and scrapped.  [You can see for yourself the land has been abandoned to this very day.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/McMasterville,+QC/@45.5403273,-73.2314636,720m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cc9aa8c356f3055:0xadd1c7a969a383e4!6m1!1e1)  It's not a farm, the land is too saturated with chemical toxins.  It's not a dump because the toxins make it too dangerous to work in.  It's just fenced off abandoned land.    
This is a [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&rem=&zm=15) to the ever-useful "NukeMap" website that shows the estimated crater and fireball size for a 3kT blast at the site.  

Same [test](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&fallout=1&zm=15), but with the fallout and radiation settings on.   

Edit:  Here is a third [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=0.02&lat=39.0388145&lng=117.7362823&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&casualties=1&humanitarian=1&rem=&zm=18), this time with a blast setting of 0.02kT, which I am being told is the more accurate value than the 3kT value that I grabbed from earlier in this thread.   (NukeMap uses google API, so you can switch to satellelite view and drag the point of impact around to compare.)
It really does look like the aftermath of some type of nuclear fallout. Scary stuff.
from Wikipedia:

>Chinese state media reported that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics,[5] a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.[3]

 

>The first to respond to the fire were unable to keep it from spreading. The Global Times reported that firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water, as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in chain more violent chemical reactions.
 
 


How can the local Fire Fighters not have a different procedure for dealing with a fire at this facility?

This makes me so strangely happy :)
I once broke both of my arms trying to go fully around the swing set when I was 12. This was before mythbusters existed and proved that to be completely idiotic. Hopefully these trash masters faired better.
25 year old here:

would love to swing again without my feet hitting the floor.
I'm from Bogotá, Colombia, and this happened in my city. :) 
I like to think that this is more than just a few garbagemen taking a break at the swing set. I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. "I'm afraid of swings" he responds. "Why" his friend asks, "did you have an accident while you were young?" "No!" he exclaimed, "I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, "look how high I can go!". 

Did that happen? probably not. 
Was there any point to that story? Nope!
 But did you read it? Well, only *you* can answer that question!
Why am I only seeing Luigis?
I always try to do this when I pass by a park. A guy I was dating told me to get off of the swing and that I was too old for that. That was awhile ago. We are no longer dating. 
Its like a real life Banksy painting 
Well when you put up with trash all the time you have to keep your good nature somehow. 
OMG, BOGOTA in the front page!!!
33 year old here. Two young kids. I love the swings more than they do! For me it will never get old.
["Men at work"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100135/) is the quintessential garbage man movie.  
This looks like something that would happen in the Sims. 
The world would be a better place if more people took 5 minutes out of their lives to act like a kid again.
:D
Goddamnit they are parked right in the middle of the fucking road though
I wonder if the two guys who swing the highest get to sit up front and the loser has to ride the handle on the back.
luigi's sons, disgruntled that their father was always off helping his brother chase princesses, sought a different line of blue collar work.
I love this so much.
This reminds me of my grandma. The garbage men often took breaks when they got to her house because she would always come out to chat and give them bags of home made cookies and jugs of ice water. 
I really wish that was taken with better gear
This is such a cute picture! Especially because everything is color coordinated!

Awesome engineering feat, delivered on time and on budget, unlike most public major constructions.

The tunnel is built on an artificial island so that CPH airport  (Kastrup) can continue to function.  A bridge would have interfered with the flight path.
i am not smart enough to understand how that won't flood.
I can imagine how frustrating it would be to build this...

"Cannot build road here. Cannot build partly above and partly below water."

Adjust land at increments of $20.

"Cannot build road here. Raise or lower land first."

Adjust more land at increments of $20.

"Cannot build road here. Too low!"

Adjust more land at increments of $20.

"Cannot build road here. Log Flume 1 in the way."
Modern engineering is awesome. 
I was backpacking through Europe with some friends, when we took a train from Amsterdam to Copenhagen. We got on the train, and all fell asleep pretty quickly. I was first to wake up and I was quick to notice that although we were still moving, it was very slow and dark. I looked out the window and down the train, and to my amazement the fucking train was being put into a big cruise ship. I quickly nudged my buddies awake, and as any engineering major would do, they all instantly sprung an infrastructure boner. We were flabbergasted. Our train is going into a boat this is insane. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any cooler, they let everyone out of the train to walk around the ship, grab a bite to eat, have a cigarette and stretch your legs. The best part though, was hitting the duty free shop and getting a bunch of booze for the rest of the trip. I don't know if that's a normal mode of transportation in Europe or even in the U.S. but it was the first time I had seen it and I was blown away.
In addition to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel already described, the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel also has the same configuration.  Here's a picture of it [EDIT: actually, with thanks to /u/chasetwisters for the clarification, a picture of its next-door neighbor bridge-tunnel the MMBT, see below for the real image].

http://media.hamptonroads.com/cache/files/images/906531000.jpg#_ga=1.143889264.453551394.1438781259

"Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridgetunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels."

So, if you like these, and you live in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area, you have your choice of two [EDIT: or, really, three] bridge-tunnels. 


while we are at it i can recommend: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_%28Danish/Swedish_TV_series%29 great series
Is there a specific reason for the "pointy" sides of the island?
That's why Denmark and Sweden are so eco friendly, they are trying to stop sea level rise to save that tunnel.
Not smart enough to post links..

Search "Bay Bridge Tunnel"

It's a bridge, tunnel, bridge, tunnel, bridge..
21.5 miles long

Voted scariest bridge in America.

There are professional car services that drive people across who are too scared to drive over it themselves but work/live on the other side.. 
Where's the traffic? 

Soirce: HRBT (VA) commuter... 
Thought this was /r/CitiesSkylines for a second.
Adding the Japan version of this: The [Tokyo Bay Aqua Line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Bay_Aqua-Line). The transition has a parking area with a variety of restaurants and great views of Mount Fuji sunsets. 
A traffic jam down there would be freaky.
I love flying into Copenhagen and seeing this bridgetunnel. As an island dweller (UK), I still find it strange how connected other EU countries are.
I happen to work for this very bridge (Øresundsbron, or The Øresund Bridge). Here's a [nice aerial video of the bridge](https://vimeo.com/oresundsbron/aerials2014). 

Also, here's a few POV videos of the drive across:

I really miss Denmark.  Beautiful Country and great people.

[Øresund Bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Øresund_Bridge) opened in 2000.
That's a pretty good Cities:Skylines screenshot.
How do they prevent flooding? The water level around the edges seems pretty high.
Why do people make this? I know there are a few bridge tunnel combos like this in Japan and America too - what's the rationale rather than a really long bridge or a really long tunnel?

Looks like midges and not mosquitoes.
You know how they give out mosquito nets in Sub Saharan Africa and other such places. Would it make any difference to the mosquito population if the nets were like spider webs and the mosquito's stuck to them and died? Or would it be a negligible kill ratio considering the swamps/puddles of water they breed in are still out there.

I-I have a confession to make.
I caused the death of spider today and I've not been able to shake the whole ordeal from my head.

You see, I was driving in my car and I see something in my peripheral vision. It's a huge golden orb-weaver. A BANANA SPIDER! He's on my window, the inside, and he's looking at me and I'm looking at him and the cop behind me is looking at both of us and wondering why I'm not driving because the light is now green.

I rolled down my window but that didn't do any good. Spider just hopped down to my arm rest. Too close for comfort. I open my door a little bit but Spider can't take a hint.

WHOOP WHOOOOOOP. The cop is now pulling us over. I turn into a near by parking lot, spider clumsily bolts out of my car via the rolled down window, officer approaches my vehicle and says "What're you doing, son?!", I hear a crunch.

I want to have sex with him. He's a weatherman named Jude Redfield, reporting out of Louisville, and certainly, his career is separate from his appearance. He's a professional meteorologist, well-liked by his community and respected among his profession, both for his friendly, jocular attitude and the accuracy of his forecasts; it is not my place to degrade or simplify this complex man down to the base component of sexual attractiveness. And yet... whither go I to express desires carnal? His jawline, his eyes, his sense of humor (a skeleton, ha ha!), all worthy of praise and adoration. And so, an armistice: while my mouth must cry my lust, it is my duty and obligation as a citizen of the world and of the internet to hew to the new standards of tact. Jude, if you are reading this: all that I've said is merely an observation of my own wanting. None of it should be taken as actionable, or as a proposition. Treat me merely as noise, as a declaration, as a statementI want to have sexthat spills over the ledge of our waking thoughts and falls into the void of the deep, deep web. And then, when I am not indexed, forget about me. My desires, my lust, are not notable, not searchable, twigs to be crushed under the wheel of your meteorlogical wagon as it rides forever further through the golden fields of WDRB 41's Doppler Radar, the same radar technology developed by NASA. Leave me. Do not look back, Jude. To quote the poet Sexton: I am a watercolor. I wash off.

I believe this is the rationale behind firing squads and public stonings.

And none of them should. They can't be held guilty by existence. They are part of a process beyond their scope. An avalanche is caused by perturbation, not by the snow.

Individual guilt for collective dysfunction is pointless. Humanity will forever be in flux, the interactions of the many determining the movement of the whole; cycles of building up to collapse to build up again. The one simply goes around for the ride in that maelstrom.

This fortune cookie's shallow philosophy is incessantly repeated by people seeing depth in it, but I frankly find it to be purporting a bullshit idea validated by it's own repackaged mass distribution.
I went to Panda Express with a buddy a few years ago. His fortune cookie just said, "Your mom."

I bet the guy who wrote that thought he was hilarious.
PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE BRAINS
I'm confused as to how this is a fortune. It's the confession bear situation but for fortune cookies.
Not exactly a fortune, but profound shit. A fortune would have been: "You will be responsible for an avalanche. Tread lightly."
Snowflake no feel responsible.  
Is snowflake.  
Snowflake feel nothing.
No raindrop in a hurricane ever feels responsible..


I wish more fortune cookie's were like this.  I always seem to get dumb ones.  
Snowflakes don't have brains, so this isn't even fair. Trust me. I know a scientist through a few people, probably.

2200 years old and still looks unbelievably good. Meanwhile, the linoleum floor in my rented duplex looks like it's been around since the birth of Christ. 

Given the location and environment, my question is how was this so immaculately preserved? Erosion doesn't seem to have had any effect on this. 
Does anyone have the article about this? What was the building years ago/what were they expecting to find?
Sometimes I wish I was a archaeologist. Finding things like this must be the best feeling in the world.

Greek student here. If anyone's interested, here's who they are. I should note, however, that the separate divisions of the muses weren't agreed upon till the end of antiquity.

In the center is Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. I'm assuming she's in the middle because they considered epic the highest poetic genre. Below her in the bottom right corner, Cleo, the muse of history. To the left, Urania, muse of astronomy. Then Polyhymnia, the muse of sacred poetry. Then Erato, muse of lyric poetry, specifically love poetry (her name is related to the word "erotic"). Then Terpsichore, muse of dance and the chorus. Then Melpomene, muse of tragedy.

>The ancient city of Zeugma was originally founded as a Greek settlement by Seleucus I Nicator, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, in 300 BC. The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000 inhabitants.

I'm surprised by all the sediment/ (for the lack of a better word) stuff that ended up on top of it over the years. Although I know 2,000 years, plus or minus half a millennium, is a lot of time for the accumulation of sediment/stuff to take place, I didn't realize several feet/ meters could pile up that fast.

It makes me so happy to know there are still things in the world to be discovered.
I was excited when i tore up a carpet and found a hardwood floor. Now i know that was bush league.
Wow, can't imagine the feeling you must get discovering this yourself. 
HOW CAN IT BE GREEK IF ITS IN TURKEY IM ONTO YOU LIBERALS DONT TRY TO PLAY ME I KNEW A MAP
PLEASE dont let ISIS find it...

Edit: ok, folks, I'm not a novice when it comes to geography, history and current events.   I said that because ISIS is right across the border on Syria, and heaven forbid, they make their way into Turkey somehow.   We see Russians in the Ukraine so why is spillover totally impossible?  I mean no offense to Muslims in general, but ISIS has history of destroying works of art, monuments and historical sites in towns it makes a home in.   Man, reddit, you are fickle and easy to insult a total stranger.   First time I've been called a "knuckle dragging mouth breather".

Edit #2:  Alright, let me justify the comment/joke behind what I said.  Current (2 week old information) shows that [ISIS holds the boarder area of Turkey in Syria and the northern end of Iraq.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0).  [That's about 25 miles/40 km](http://imgur.com/E1PqDqE) to the site where that mosaic is being uncovered...Not really far.  Of course its a stretch to say ISIS will invade Turkey anytime soon.  But sheesh man, they're right there at the doorstep.  Chill out people.
This will probably get buried but I work for the Biblical Archaeology Society and we did a short piece on this last week. This is from Zeugma, an ancient trading center that was the only point traders and travelers could cross the Euphrates. The name literally means "bridge". In the 90s turkey built a dam farther down the river and submerged 30% of the site underwater. They've been excavating since 2000 and this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. 
I think it's worth pointing out that these mosaics actually date to the 2nd or 3rd cent. A.D., so at a glance, they are about 1,750 to 1,850 years old, rather than 2,200, as has been reported in the media.
([Here is a good source](http://www.ccaroma.org/en/zeugma-conservation-mosaics) for more reliable info, if anyone's interested.)

There were definitely some very stunning and intricate polychrome mosaics in the Hellenistic period; it might even be considered the height of the craft.  But there are some stylistic differences that set the later mosaics apart.  That includes things like the heavy borders, the interlocking geometric patterns, the use of large(-ish) tesserae, the heavily rounded and shaded facial features, etc.
You can compare them, for example, to [these other 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics](http://followinghadrian.com/2014/10/15/roman-mosaics-from-the-national-archaeological-museum-of-spain-madrid/) from Spain.

Interestingly, it's thought that the interlocking geometric 'panel' designs in some mosaics might have been designed to imitate the elaborate panelling of the ceilings in the rooms where they were laid.

Gorgeous mosaics!  So nice to see that they've been spared the flooding that's overtaken so much of the site.

[Edit]  P.S. Also note some of the qualities I listed for 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics are common to Hellenistic mosaics, too (compare the Zeugma pavements to the [Alexander Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#mediaviewer/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) from Pompeii, for example (ca. 100 B.C.).  An art historian can probably add to this better than I can, but some of the differences are kind of ineffable to pin down.
Oh man, crosspost over to /r/AncientCivilizations, they'd love this!
They used sealer.
awesome
In Gaziantep, the closest major city to the archeological site, there's a state of the art "mosaic museum" that showcases finds from Zeugma. 

I was there a few months ago and had a blast. Southeastern Turkey is completely safe and refreshingly light on on other tourists, making you the recipient of a lot of warm hospitality from the locals.

This was sculpted by Lorenzo Quinn using bronze, stainless steel, and aluminium. [According to his website](http://www.lorenzoquinn.com/en/the-force-of-nature-ii-new-york) this piece is called *The Force of Nature II*:

> We humans think of ourselves as supreme beings, above all others and in absolute control of our destiny and our surroundings. We live with a false sense of security only to be awakened by Mother Natures fury, almost as if she needs to remind us of her presence and our responsibility towards her child (The Earth).

> After having seen the ravaged coast of Thailand and the Hurricane that affected the Southern States I decided to create a sculpture dedicated to Mother Nature. This would be reminiscent of the early statues made as peace offerings  to the Gods in the hope of quenching their anger.

> In essence, people are not very different today from the people who lived thousands of years ago. We still devote ourselves to symbols in order to escape our destiny.

For those of you in NYC, this sculpture (or one of his copies) is currently on display inside the lobby of 1301 Sixth Avenue (the Credit Agricole building). Honestly, the picture here is great, but seeing it in person makes you realize how much a flat picture doesn't do it justice.

Kinda depressing story ...

When I was 16 I went on an Alaskan cruise.  I got food poisoning and was in bed or throwing up through most of the trip, but I was well enough to watch the cruise through and past a whole bunch of glaciers next to each other.  One after the other.  It was amazing.  It felt like they were SO close to me and the ship.  Totally amazing seeing them all dead end into a big body of water.

So this year I went on the same kind of cruise again.  I'm 31 now and decided it was time to go and not get deathly ill.  It was a great cruise this time, but when it came to cruise past those VERY SAME glaciers ... they were almost gone.  They had receded SO FAR back up the mountains that we were hardly able to get close to them at all.  I had to use my binoculars just to see the detail I was able to see just looking out a window last cruise.  

The amount of melting, just in the short 15 years I had been there last, was SO fucking depressing to me.

tl;dr:  Went to Alaska 15 years apart.  Glaciers are disappearing.  We're fucked as a species.
In the years to come when this is reposted kids will ask "what's a glacier?"
This image reminds me of a documentary of Inuit mussel-gatherers waiting for the sea ice to drop so they can break through the ice and harvest mussels before the sea rises again. Here's the documentary by BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMZYDQ6v24
How thick is the ice above you? Seems like sunlight can get through
I now realize if Superman had his ice fortress it would have melted by now.

GG global warming GG
That looks incredible OP
I saw the picture and said "whoa" out loud.  This is /r/whoahdude  worthy.
I wonder how the water tastes.
Light blue helmet looks very happy :)
Is that Mendenhall Glacier?
That is so fucking cool and so fucking scary at the same time.
That's a bit clumsy of you. They're huge!
How dangerous is that? I went camping at some ice caves a few years back (not inside, just near them) and there were signs everywhere saying to not go in them and if you do to not make any noise in them. In fact, a few months back a person was killed and some injured due to back to back collapses in a matter of days.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlDxgo-L7DM
Look out for Falmer.
I remember a geology professor explicitly telling us how incredibly dangerous hiking "into" a glacier is
How dangerous is that? I mean, if they're receding so quickly, they'd be weak and thin, no? But thin for a glacier is much more than enough to fall and kill someone.  
I didn't even know you could do that. Awesome.
You possess the bravery that we don't, kudos to you
Pleaae tell me you tried the water, looks so refreshing and clean
Wait... What?! You are truly living your life to the fullest. 
You're not actually going INTO a glacier?!

Shit like this is why losing the World Cup to Japan wasn't so hard to take.
Good news is, the lab boys say the symptoms of asbestos poisoning show a median latency of forty-four point six years, so if you're thirty or older, you're laughing. Worst case scenario, you miss out on a few rounds of canasta, plus you forwarded the cause of science by three centuries. I punch those numbers into my calculator and it makes a happy face. 
In America our elders just spend our money.  Then blame us for it.
This is the way men were expected to act when they were growing up, and how people in general still should. You hear stories form the Titanic where the men would put on their best suits and usher their wives and children into the lifeboats and tell them they'd get on the next one and not to worry. They knew they were about to die, but they did it with dignity. Again here you have the old stepping up and taking fate with dignity to make sure others don't suffer.

I hope to god if a moment in life is put forward like this to me I'm not too cowardly to let someone else take the risk for me.
This is called heroism. 
I read an article about this a while back.  In addition to the reasoning stated in the picture, they also said something to the effect of "We're the generation that brought nuclear power plants to Japan, so we should be the ones responsible for it."  Just awesome, awesome stuff.

I never would have guessed that a cute picture of a frog could hide such a shitstorm of OP-hating and drama. 
I wish I had an awesome shower frog :/
He keeps the bugs down. I like it.
Oh man, frogs are kickass. I remember when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old, me and a friend made some traps out of plastic bottles. We caught around 20 frogs and one trout in a single day. Ended up digging an old aquarium out of the basement and putting them in that. Made a lot of land space with aquarium sand, had a little watery bit and put the trout in there. Only problem was that my room didn't have enough space, so I had to put it in my 3 year old sisters room. Turns out frogs can jump *(Who knew)*, and will do so if put in a shitty aquarium. I awoke to the sound of my little sister laughing like a maniac and my mother flipping shit. Ran in to see the room, including my little sisters crib fucking covered in frogs. God damn that was hilarious. Then my mother found the trout. More shit was flipped, and I had to set the frogs, and the god damn motherfucking trout free in our garden. **I released a motherfucking trout into the natural fucking habitat of my god damn front lawn!** He had it coming though, that trout was a dick. Smug bastard. Watching 20 something frogs, and one trout jump around on the lawn was good fun. Me and that friend ended up having a lot of fun with frogs and trouts that summer.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, take good care of that frog, he might very well save your life one day. Oh, and trouts are dicks.
He has licked your toothbrush
I have never seen a group of people so concerned on the states of someone's else's shower in which they will never be. 
I think it's really cool that you have a little amphibian buddy in there, but the people who are bothered by him being near your toothbrush are right - frogs can carry salmonella and other germs that you don't want to get in your mouth.
I like frogs a lot, he's pretty cute.  I can't help thinking he'd be happier outside.
He doesn't bother you, but I bet he bothers all over your toothbrush.
Frogs, like other reptiles and amphibians, can have salmonella on their skin.  Right next to your toothbrush *might* not be be the safest place to let him chill.
I've got quite a few of this same species of frog living on my property (like OP, I'm also in Florida) and about two years ago we had a record breaking cold winter night. It pretty much devastated all of my tropical plants and killed dozens of these little guys. They were strewn about my property like little frozen frogsicles.

Anyway, that same morning I woke up to a frog swimming around my toilet. I had no idea how it got in there, but I calmly escorted him out of the house. On my way back in my wife shrieked, "there's a frog in the toilet!" To which I replied that I already got him out. But clearly I didn't because, sure enough, there was a frog in the toilet. And then another and another and another...

All told, there were around 20 frogs in the toilet itself and the pipes leading to it. According to the plumber who was hired to get them out, they crawled in there for warmth (and probably did so through the vent). It was one of the most bizarre things I'd ever experienced but the plumber disagreed, "Nothing peculiar about it. Just got some frogs in your toilet."

Gotta love Florida.
you're gonna be pissed as fuck when he turns out to be a she and shits frog spawn all over your shower. Pissed As Fuck.

Who cares if the room is covered in lime? People shit in there anyway. There's a difference between being dirty and being old and lived in. Sorry we can't all live in the four seasons. All you people bitching about filth need to take the aerator off of your bathroom faucets and if it's not full of nasty junk I will eat my shoe. 
I would like to say that even though people are enraged by my shower, I made it to the front page.

Wow, I wonder what it would have been like to be down in the canyon at the time.
When they say "once-in-a-decade" does that just mean it happens rarely, or based on certain weather patterns it's likely to happen once every decade? (like an el nino). 

Also, would there be any kind of way to find out if it would happen before hand or did people just wake up yesterday and go "oh shit, look at all dem clouds"

One of the early airlines was Trans World Airlines, or TWA.  TWA fell on hard times and people abandoned them for fear they would lose their frequent flyer miles.  

However, to keep people from jumping ship, they gave you an upgrade card that let you upgrade to first class without trading in any miles or paying any fee if you flew 30,000 miles per year, which I did each year.  I stuck with them to the bitter end  because it meant I flew everywhere first class for the price of a coach ticket.

One night, I was flying JFK to SFO, cross country, and the stewardess came to me with 4 movies and asked me which one I wanted to see.  I told her I was just going to sleep during the flight and to ask another passenger.

You guessed it: no other passengers.  747 plane with a full crew.  It was a sad day.  I asked her why they didn't just cancel the flight and she said they needed the plane in SF the next day.  An entire 747 widebody jet to myself.  Suck it Page and Brin.  
You could **almost** fit the number of people who have commented "So much room for activities!" in there...if you stacked them like firewood.
this is Ryanair, you have to bring your own seat and toilet, because its not included in the ticket price

I can't believe you idiots think airplanes actually exist. The ones that "take you to a different location" merely make a bunch of noises that sound like airplanes and they play videos of the sky in the windows. You're actually just in a network of subterranean tunnels. The ones you see in the sky are just projections cast on the sky from the earth.
Now imagine a kitchen, bathroom, livingroom, and bedroom in there.....the ultimate "mobile" home...
The #&*%ing overhead bins would still be full when you get on.

A lot of people think of woolly mammoths as huge, but there are a few mammoth species described so far (about 10 or so from different time periods and locations) and most of them were not actually bigger than modern elephants, perhaps around the size of Asian Elephants. A few different sized *Mammuthus* species lived in Siberia at different times, the Southern Mammoth and the Steppe Mammoth were both older and about twice the size of the Woolly Mammoth which was actually pretty small. 

I will try find some good size comparisons these are a bit shit but give [you some](http://i.imgur.com/ZcOk9Tr.jpg) kind of [idea](http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/exhibits/longterm/mastodon/images/mastsize.gif).


One of the really cool things they can do with mammoth tusks is look at the 'rings' like a tree and figure out from growth patterns various things about their lives, like how many calves a female might have had during her life.

Fun fact: When the pyramids were being built, there were still a few Mammoths wandering around in a remote part of Siberia. 
wow! is that a average size? because there must have been some pretty big mammoth on the other end of that!
National Geographic Magazine published an article in 2013 about the people who hunt for mammoth tusks.

These animals, in the grand scheme of things, were still alive practically just yesterday. Just the way Europe is inching closer to recreating the Auroch, do you think there's any chance of reviving the Mammoth somehow?

I don't think Montana is underrated by anyone. 
Glacier is the most beautiful national park Montana has hands-down; I was raised in Helena, Montana and it was always a treat driving up there and seeing the sheer beauty Glacier has to offer. 
We should keep it that way so less people come to Montana. 
Going to the Sun Road, which is in Glacier, is one of the most beautiful and terrifying things to drive.  There are better views than this one (especially at sunset or sunrise, but here's the best one i could find:

There is almost no place in Glacier National Park where you can take a bad photo.  The scenery is absolutely amazing.

That's pretty smart. He's got his own business. Put this guy on youtube and he might do a little better.
Honestly I passed this guy on the street, I'd make it a habit to track him down just so I can talk to him. Like an impromptu book club. 

It's really frustrating that I can't find anyone nowadays to talk books with. My husband doesn't read, my coworkers don't read, my friends don't read, my dogs only read what I read aloud to them. 

It's hokey but I miss those days where a whole class read a book and discussed it, even if the book sucked we could all rip it apart together.

Background info: user /u/stevenette provided a link containing images which briefly explained the situation that is happening in the nation right now. [Here's the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/2mvyng/mexico_is_dying/)

Today, November 20, various social media outlets and awareness inside the nation declared this day as a day to march against the corruption in the government and in remembrance to the students of Ayotzinapa. Various cities across the nations participated in the march wearing black clothes. This photo was taken at El Zocalo or Constitutional Square in the center of Mexico DF, the capital.
Viva Mexico. Good luck and godspeed, fighting corruption is brave!

Chicago tonight in solidarity with the protests in Mexico. It was nowhere near as big as in Mexico City, but we had a decent turnout. Maybe around 500 people or so.

¡Suerte hermanos!
What's sad is that I live in Guadalajara and just recently came to Monterrey, the second two largest cities in Mexico, and I'm getting all my news about the protests from Reddit /r/pics or *world*news ..

There is a fundamental apathy and lack of media coverage in Mexico (yay corruption) that makes the fact that protests this large were able to get organized so much more impressive. Mexicans work damn hard and crazy hours and it's sad to see them get taken advantage so much by the monopolies and corruption that plagues their country. They could be an economic powerhouse with a government that gave even the slightest damn about the country instead of filling their individual pockets.
As a Mexican it is heartwarming to come to reddit trying to get a laugh from some gif and find this in the front page. Corruption is fucking us in many aspects but reading all your supporting comments makes me feel we're not alone. I've never liked so many comments in a single post. 

Thank you guys, Mexico loves you back.
Brave people, this news is being covered in the UK papers.  
Good Luck from Turkey! Spread the word!
I sincerely hope something changes because of this. Ya me canse

btw, that thing burning in the center of El Zocalo is a pinhata of Mexican president Enrique Penia Nieto [picture](http://aristeguinoticias.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Marcha_Accio769n_global_por_Ayotzinapa-2-ERH-854x440.jpg)

Edit: in several villages of Mexico it is an old tradition to burn these pinhatas in celebrations aimed to scare away demons and evil beings, burning this pinhata of the president is almost as sentence, as prophecy that the guy is gonna fall
Please excuse my ignorance, but what specific instances of corruption are being protested? 
The ENTIRE time during these protests the main TV station in Mexico, Televisa, did not report or cover jack shit! They're websites were all covered with Obama, celebrities, and fashion/diet tips. DESPITE the fact that participants of these protests went to Televisa's station to protest around it earlier today. Televisa's website (in the US) kept on redirecting to www.televisa.com/us despite attempts to go through Google Mexico and attempting televisa.com.mx. Guys, it is now clearer than ever that the few corrupt rats in power are attempting to shake this off as "just another" of those occasional movements. Mexico has had ENOUGH. #YAMECANSE 
I am proud of the Human Race when I see so many who refuse to accept the corruption and are willing to do something about it. 
Texan here. Viva Mexico mis hermanas y hermanos.
If America is really all about immigrant reform, then we should be more attentive to the events unfolding in Mexico.  If Mexico can change the current corrupted Government and make a better home for themselves, then maybe Mexicans wouldn't want to leave in the first place.
Goddamn I love Mexico.

What's burning in the middle?
Beautiful! Mexicanos al grito de guerra!
Stay safe out there, Mexibros. 
Piece of advice from Spain. It's been more than 3 years since our massive demonstrations but we still have the same government, the situation is worse than ever (getting worse) and there's still a lot to do. But lots of people has grown some conscience and that's the seed of future revolutions.

Do not lose momentum and take this protests to the last extent. Changes are hard and take time and people in power will do ANYTHING to keep that power. So act quickly, be firm and stay united. This is not political, as it wasn't in Spain. It's just a bunch of criminals who are stealing from people and using their position to their own advantage. All of them should face jail.

Another way of driving democracy is possible,  but we need to reduce corruption and the influence big companies have. Government priority has to be the greater good, not the interests of a few.

Good luck!

Maybe the idea isn't to save money, but in fact to reach out and hope that this idea makes people feel more involved and think a little more about their environment.
I like that they had to specify "without a filter," otherwise people would be getting all valencia up on these twigs and dirt piles.

Conclusions:

"After two years of observations, we discovered that a burned out area ecosystem responds in quite unorthodox ways. The attached timelapse shows how the plant life starts regrowing from the underbrush, but then unpredictably gets populated by selfies and penises, species precedently unknown to populate such ecosystems. Further research is needed to reach any definitive conclusion."
Is anybody else irritated that the bracket direction illustrated on the sign doesn't match up with the actual bracket position?
That is so freaking awesome!  I love it!
I wonder how the timelapse will end up now that this is posted on Reddit..
I passed this sign on a hike of the top of at Mt Diablo last Friday. For anyone in the Bay Area it's a great time to go. The wildflowers are everywhere and there are some that have not been seen in 50+ years because the fire has allowed for the right conditions for them to show up again. Also the clear days we've been getting make for killer views where you can see the GG bridge and Lake Tahoe Mountains.
I interviewed one of the people behind this idea. The phone holder is worth $1.50 and can be found at most hardware stores.

Pretty ingenious idea and a great way to keep across ecosystem regrowth after fires. Check out the interview [here](https://soundcloud.com/1233newcastle/monitoring-fire-regrowth-with-smartphones) if you want. 
I saw this today too, all over Twitter. So I thought, let's see how successful that hashtag has been in documenting the change in that landscape.

What a GREAT picture.
Just think, thousands of years ago an ancient Egyptian likely stood at this exact spot looking out at the Great Pyramid during its construction. It's mind blowing trying to comprehend how many different people layed their eyes on these structures over the course of the past 5,000 years.

It looks so fake, but incredible! 
Having been there, I'd be stunned if this was real. The pollution and air quality is so bad that usually you can't even see the small sister pyramids when you're at the great pyramids, let alone crystal clear across the city. Usually you can only see the sister pyramids a few times a year when it's not overly hot or highly polluted. 
It looks like a matte painting from a 1960's movie.
I'm sure this comment will get lost in the plethora of other comments but this is an amazing picture. I've never seen this contrast before of the pyramids against the urban foreground. 
Well that's awesome. 
That is a really wide road

>David Kaszlikowski used a drone and a little spare time to discover a stunning scene atop a glacier near K2, the worlds second-highest peak.

>It started while Kaszlikowski was shooting the upcoming documentary K2 Touching the Sky. He wanted a personal project to occupy his downtime during the weeks-long filming schedule, so he sent his DJI Phantom on a recon mission to scout shooting locations. The drone scoped out places around Concordia, the area below K2 where the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers converge. Kaszlikowski spotted a section of glacier that was melting away, creating a dramatic clone-like structure and a picturesque miniature river.

>The place was special, making a very clean graphic frame, he says. It was disappearing, melting, changing its form every day. It was quite obvious nobody will photograph it again like me; nobody will see it the same way the next season.

Here's a summary on the shot and the [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/david-kaszlikowski-k2-glacier/)

Looks like where you'd find an Ice-Type Legendary.
This clears up some issues of what why it looks like that: 

*The Polish photographer and a guide trekked to the spot at night to create a strange but vivid image that looks like it might be an alien planet. He used a 30-second exposure shot with a Canon 5D Mark III on a tripod. While the shutter was open, he painted the water and surrounding area with an LED, creating an eerie glow on the ice and sky. Although he was there during the summer, the temperature still drops to a frosty 5 degrees Fahrenheit up there at 16,000 feet, so his hands were plenty cold while working.*

*The final image plays tricks with size and scale, and the foreground doesnt provide many clues. Although the bend in the river is 65 feet wide, the mountains in the background are some of the highest in the world. The region includes K2, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum I and IIall of them topping 26,000 feet.*

And then [these motherfuckers](https://i.imgur.com/kogRcW0.jpg) trod everywhere through it.
This was not* a "drone", it was an rc helicopter (or [radio controlled multirotor helicopter](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom) ).  I know it's another mags/clips thing, but if we all try, I think we can correct it!  
*Edit: As pointed out below, this model has a self-guided self-operation mode, so I guess it qualifies as a drone and an rc helicopter. _The more you know!_
Bullshit. That's a bowl of rocky mint chocolate chip HagenDaas in front of a picture of stars and mountains. 
What is making drones so ubiquitous now that wasn't present 10 years ago?

Did we not know how to make quad rotored remote control helicopters back then?  Is it the small cameras?   I don't get it.

I've got to be honest here. It looks like cheap CG. I know it's not, but that's what it looks like.
I recommend the Himalayas to everyone.

I live in Colorado, so tall mountains and snow aren't new to me.

But the Himalayas are certainly a different thing...Just visited them, they are just massive.Their glaciers, lakes that are 15000 foot high of clear crystal water.

One of the cooler parts was when I was able to look down at the Ganges flood plain from height and barely make out New Delhi (or its pollution).

>Every five years Amsterdam welcomes sailors and ship enthusiasts to enjoy the parade of historic tall ships as part of Sail Amsterdam. The spectacle takes place in IJ bay, in the Dutch capital.
 
>From Wednesday, August 19, through to Sunday, August 23, the ninth Sail Amsterdam event will be held in Amsterdam. The popular opening parade runs for 12 kilometers and will consist of 50 tall sailing ships. Many of the vessels will have sailed there directly from Bremerhaven in Germany where another tall ships event ended last Sunday.

>In total, more than 1,000 vessels are expected to participate in the sailing extravaganza in IJ bay. Organizers expect up to two million visitors to attend the free event. According to them, Sail Amsterdam is the largest public event in the Netherlands - and the largest event of its kind in the world.

[Here's the photographer's flickr.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/megane_wakui/)

Love this guy's work, great wallpaper material.
It looks like it might be a still from the new Blade Runner 2 movie.
It appears to be from a series. [Here is another one](http://i.imgur.com/j1DWGOB.jpg).
mmmmmm Mister Donut
This looks like it could be in 5 cm Per Second.
Is that in Shinjuku, just up the corner from the Golden Gai? 
This's is how i picture a Murakami Novel. 
this reminded me of a photo I took last year, also during a rainy but colorful night in Tokyo: http://imgur.com/29gYn5I

less effects on this one, actually it's almost straight out of my phone camera, but love all the reflections on the floor :)
The first time I went to Tokyo, it was a very surreal experience. I had just broken up with my long time girlfriend and I felt like I needed a change of pace. We had always talked about going and we started planning a trip just before she left. I thought to myself that now was as good a time as any, so I booked a trip and took some time off work. My mother who I had not seen much of in recent years, came along with me. It was going to be a nice vacation for both of us and a great chance to spend some time together like we used to when I was young. 

After a grueling 14 hour flight, we landed in Narita international. At first the fact that I was half way around the world didn't phase me. Airports all look the same to me. It wasn't until I got to the lower level where the NEX train was waiting that it actually hit me. I was in Japan. I got my JR pass from the kind woman at the counter and got on the train headed to my stop at Shinjuku station. 

Looking out the window of the train as we passed through Chiba, the rain was ticking against the glass. I tried my best to take I'm the view while my mother closed her eyes and got some rest. One of the most impressive things I remember seeing, as I approached Tokyo, was the Tokyo Skytree, an absolutely massive tower sitting in the center of the sprawling buildings, like a massive tree amongst the bushes. 

The train pulled into Shinjuku station and we gathered our items. We walked for a few minutes before arriving at street level where we were surrounded by giant buildings. The rain was coming down, which I thought was unusual as it was mid December, and back home there was thick snow. I took out my camera and snapped a shot of the street. The glowing buildings illuminated the rain around me. That was one of my most memorable moments of Japan. 
Some Blade Runner right there
That slight tilt counterclockwise is messing with my OCD.    
Otherwise very nice.
Reminds of Lost in Translation 
This came from [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/megane_wakui/), there are tons more of great shots
[Here's a similar one I took in February](http://i.imgur.com/ESzrrSq.jpg)

EDIT: Just looked at OPs flickr and these photos were taken on the exact same night
Thanks, needed a new desktop background. Very pretty this.
Neon lights refracted through rain is one of the beautiful things about a city.  
Kinda reminded me of a scene from Resident Evil movies. Do not remember which one was it, but Alice was in the underground facility that looked similar to this scene.
This is Masashi Wakui.
Insert "Blade Runner" Theme
even with instagram filters
EDIT: to those complaining about me disrespecting the photographer: this is obviously sarcasm... (should've added "/s") 
They forgot to take down the Christmas lights.

OOOH Mister Donut!
I've seen things you ppl would not believe.  I've seen battleships on fire, on the shoulders of Orion.  I've seen moonbeams glisten, in the dark, at tauhaseurs gate.  These memories, will be lost to time. Like tears. In rain... Time to die.
I may be too late in this thread to tell this story to all who come... Not interested in fake internet points if they are not earned...

I want to tell of my experience in Tokyo.

I attended the great Tokyo dome international quilt festival in 2012. Having dreamed of being in Tokyo my entire life I finally realized my dream. 

After working for 3 of the 10 days I had available I had the opportunity to see something I had dreamed of seeing... Harajuku...

Early afternoon, after lunch, I arrived at the "Top?" Of Harajuku street. Top is relative to me only. I stood on a hill and could see up the street.. It has several dips and rises so it looks "hilly".

As I stood taking in the landscape I heard a cheering, a gentle swelling of voices, female voices, coming toward me.

I could see from my vantage point that the sky was a different color at the far end of the street, and that snow was starting to fall off in the distance.

I was at the correct angle to see snow falling in a 
Line, up the street, coming towards me.

As the snow reached the crowd in the distance I could see and hear the "wave" of reaction that surged toward me.

The snowflakes fell from the sky, and 1000 Japanese teens, tweens, and twenty somethings looked up and cheered the white specks falling from the sky.

Like "The Wave" I have experienced in an American sports stadium many times before, the cheers and cries of delight rolled up the street and enveloped me, passed me, and continued off into the distance...

One of the most memorable and powerfully emotional experiences of my 50 years.

I thought this was a painting for a moment. It's so pretty.

This looks like the bat caves near Battambang, Cambodia. Around a million bats fly out of the cave every day. The place STINKS of bat shit.
Wonderful showcase of how intelligent nature can be here. They're flying around the sun so that the photographer gets a really cool photo, so that the photo will be spread on the internet, and bat preservation charities will prosper. Nature is incredible.

I'm too lazy to read the all the comments but if it hasn't been mentioned: there is something called White Nose Syndrome that is killing bats at an alarming rate, especially in the northern and eastern US. If you go into caves or anything be careful you could end up bringing in contamination. Just an FYI to spread some knowledge.

An adult oyster can filter and clean up to 50 gallons of water per day.  Cool picture illustrating this.
A time-lapse video of this would have been great. 

Edit: here's a time-lapse video of oysters filtering water ... http://youtu.be/1Zm-yMpHsaQ
So does that mean all the dirt from the water is IN the oysters?
Its amazing that they take in filth and crap out pearls. 

Step it up trees, what do you do, suck in pollution and shit out oxygen? Pfffft, I can't give my girlfriend a necklace made out of that.
That's amazing. Oyster's are the trees of the water.
So what you're saying is I should put them in my drinking water? 
Does that mean I can keep my oysters in my salt-water aquarium?
Introducing new SeaFresh Water Filters!

Using the power of the sea our patented Oy! Ster Filtration system filters your water to make it 99% cleaner^+ and 99% wetter^+

*Clam^++ that's some clean water*

^^+ ^^Disclaimer: ^^All ^^claims ^^made ^^in ^^this ^^advertisement ^^may ^^not ^^be ^^correctly ^^not ^^a ^^false ^^lie

^^++ ^^Product ^^contains ^^oysters ^^not ^^clams
I swear I went to a field trip **years** ago around the Chesapeake Bay that had this exact demonstration. Is this in that area?
What are the practical applications of this? Can we just use oysters to clean city water? 

Wait, even better, we should start a line of bottled water that has like a single.oyster sitting in the bottom of the bottle. We can call it... H2Oyster
**Window washers hate this secret!**
Ocean acidification is threatening oysters.  Larval oysters are having a harder time forming their shell. This is a good way of showing why this matters. 
The conclusion I draw from this is that I should never eat oysters again.
Unfortunately, you'll not see the water quality benefits of oyster reintroductions. Attempts at creating safe populations, where they can breed and increase their numbers fails as oyster fishermen poach every bed they find. 

Sources: I attended the Marine Estaurine Environmental Sciences program at Univ Maryland at the Chesapeake Bay.
So I should put oysters in the bottom of my bong?
THANK YOU.
Now the other fucking post i was reading with the 2 army tanks makes a HELL of a lot more sense now.
I've been thinking about it for the past 20 minutes and couldn't understand why i was so fucking confused =s
If the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay was what it historically was, it would filter the entire bay's volume of water in 3 days. The oyster population is so low now that it takes over a year. 
Can the oysters also predict the World Series winner?
Oysters are great. I organize an effort in my town to create oyster mats. These mats are chained together in specific areas of the river and foster new oyster beds by giving the larvae a place to attach to. If we get enough growth, it may have a positive effect on our river's water quality. Each oyster can filter 50 gallons a day of water and they are a keystone species of many ecosystems.
This isn't as clear-cut of a comparison as the image wants you to believe. The water being clear isn't an indication of ecological health any more than being murky is. Murky could be pollutants, but it could also be algae. Algae are necessary to the ecosystem. The water on the right appears stripped of algae because the oysters eat it. That's good up to a point, and then it starts being a problem.

If I showed you this exact same image using lake water and zebar mussels, it would be a demonstration of the ecological damage done by invasive zebra mussels.
That's where the flavour comes from.
Question: Can I get oysters and put them in a fish tank with my fish and never have to clean the water again? Or at least not clean it so often?
I can't look at this without being horribly reminded about getting norovirus from oysters a couple of years ago, and this pic kinda makes it a bit clearer just how easy it is for them to pick up bacteria from the water. I've never been so ill in my adult life and haven't been able to eat oysters since! 
From my intense studying and observations, the water with the oysters seems to be cleaner. 
Kind of makes oysters seem unappetizing.

Non-skier here. Why do they groom the snow like this? Doesn't snow generally fall equally from the sky?
As a skier, this is also one of my favorite things to see

Edit: insert classic "didn't expect this to blow up and went to sleep". Also a lot of people have questioned my skiing ability and I am quite frankly insulted. I'm not going to argue with people about who the better skier is, but I've been skiing since I was 4, so I think it's safe to say I'm a pretty damn good skier. Secondly, if you read carefully you see that I said "one of my favorite things". I am an east coast skier and love powder when I get it but as I said in a comment below, it gets skied off fast and becomes ice. That is why it is one of my favorite things to see, because I know I don't have much time before the real gapers get out and all the snow gets skied off

As someone who lives in the southeast, I have no idea what this is supposed to be a picture of, though I am very interested. Could someone fill me in on (1) why the slopes look like that, (2) what they do to make the slopes look like that, and (3) why do people like slopes like that?

How long does it take for the skis to germinate? Also, do you rotate skis and snowboards, or do you only grow skis in your fields?
How is this accomplished?

There should be a sub reddit for pictures of people when they first discover snow
And that's how they lost the race.
I live in a country in north Africa and I have never seen/touched snow in real life. I hope one day I visit a place where I can see/touch the snow for the first time ever. 
When I was in college, there was a guy from Africa (I want to say Zimbabwe or Zaire but I can't remember). Turns out, he's never seen snow or experienced cold weather. He told me he had a jacket and showed me a paper thin Members Only jacket. I explained to him about the dangers of frostbite and the importance of thick socks, boots, gloves, hats,  and having a real coat.

I even drove him to Goodwill where he found the right clothes for a tough Ohio winter. For the next few months, he would smile and thank me for teaching him about how to stay warm with the right clothes. 

Edit: grammar
I went to college with this girl who was Swedish, but grew up in Miami. Swedish family, spoke Swedish at home, etc. But in South Florida. She made regular trips to Sweden every summer to visit family there.

But never in the winter. One year she flies to Sweden in December and it's snowing. She reacts to snow the way most people in south Florida do--joy, utter amazement, running around trying to catch flakes on your tongue, etc.

So there's this scene of this full-blooded Swedish girl, speaking Swedish, in Sweden, seeing snow for the first time at 16 years of age. That must've been some kind of weird to see.
Guy second from the back: "this shit is cold!"
I was in high school in NJ when we got a student from Jamaica. Because of different grade levels there, he was actually a year or two younger than the rest of us. We became friends. One day he asked me about the leaves changing colors and I explained how they would do that and then they would all fall off. He then asked a very anxious follow-up question:

"Will they come back?" :-)

I reassured him they would. 
It began to snow on the first day of a freshman undergrad class I was in. A classmate from India with a thick accent shyly admitted he had never seen snow, so our professor encouraged our small class to run outside so Mohit could experience snowfall. I'll never forget his big smile, total sense of wonder, and his first comment when we got outside: "Oh my goodness! It is like God has really bad dandruff!" 
You haven't seen snow until you've seen it in giant piles in shopping mall parking lots; the snow dyed grey by the car exhaust. 
It is like a two wheeled Cool Runnings.

*Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme! Get on up, its biking time!*
"So you're telling me there's a whole other Olympic Games held in the winter based on this stuff?"
Only slightly related:  An African team will be participating in this year's Tour de France for the first time.  Don't miss it!
I'm in Australia and I've also never seen snow before. I hear it's cold.
This looks like the kind of photo I would want to send on a deep-space probe...Similar to Voyager. Not only are these men all displaying very pleasant human emotions, but they've taken a momentary break from competition to allow one of the greatest drives behind humanity take over: curiosity. They've never seen snow, but by god, they're investigating it for themselves. The first two are busy scooping some up while the one 4th from the back is displaying that what he's holding is not as pleasant as he first thought. Meanwhile the remaining two are busy laughing/smiling at the shared group experience.

10/10, would show to aliens. 
I have a good friend from Haiti. He was visiting once in December and we had 6-7 inches of snow on the ground. He hadn't even learned about snow in Haiti nor did he attend school. He didn't really understand how it worked, so he starts putting some in a bag. I asked him what he was doing and he says, "I've got to bring some home to my daughter. She's going to love it."
[Here's](http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-03/how-walk-ice-and-other-essential-winter-survival-tips-newcomers-america) an article I remember from a while ago (probably on Reddit, honestly) about educating refugees from warm countries about how to dress for cold weather / how to walk on ice / etc.
Team Rwanda has a documentary on it on Netflix, Rising from Ashes.

There's more to Rwanda than genocide.
My boss is from india and this is his first time seeing snow. the day after about 5 inches of snow, when there were just flurries he was worried about driving home. After assuring him it wouldnt affect his drive home, he asked me what happened when it melted.i was confused. 

i said "what?  what do you mean?"

"when it all melts what happen?  do they have to close the roads cuz they are all flooded?"  

It blew my mind that he didnt know what happened when snow melted.  I just figured everyone knew that it all just goes away.

That's how i would react if I ever see snow. (I'm from California)
My aunt is married to a man who had children with two other women before he met her. His first wife lived near them in New Jersey, but the second was in Arizona. When their son was a teen, he moved from Arizona to NJ to spend some time with his dad and get the benefit of the better school system. They had his mom up for holidays, and while she was visiting for christmas it snowed heavily... and she'd never seen snow before, she'd lived her whole life in Arizona. My aunt bundled her up in some winter wear and took her for a walk.

She knew it fell from the sky. She knew it was cold. She'd had a sno-cone before, so she kinda understood the texture. What she hadn't imagined was how *quiet* the world becomes when it snows, how the snow absorbs all sound and there's a beautiful silence. 

Having lived in the northeast all my life I'm sick of snow in most ways, but I still enjoy that silence in the middle of a snowstorm.
Moved to Philadephia. That was the first time I ever saw snow. When the "flurries" started I thought it was volcanic ash, panicked, and ran inside a bank. Then I saw no one else was running. Then I thought someone was shredding plastic bags and thought it was highly rude, and harmful to the environment. Then I took a bus back home. When I realized that this plastic bag shredding extended all the way to my house, I started doubting myself. It took me 4 hours to finally discover snow.....

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't they only have had to fit two angles when it was set? the others would have been created to fit the later layer and the corresponding stones. 

I've only built one brick/stone wall, but when we did it we started at the bottom.
> Just as individual blocks were prepared, so too were the adjoining stones already set in the wall.  In order to receive a new block, bedding planes were carved into those stones below or to the side of the block to be added. This is how the Twelve-Angled Stone took on its busy upper outline; the upper portions of the block were recarved several times over as five blocks  set in a left to right sequence  were fitted along the course above.

> Other blocks in the wall were similarly shaped, then reshaped as new blocks were added to the masonry mass. As stones of irregular size and degree of finish were inserted into the mural fabric with fastidious technical consistency, the wall went up as tectonic sculpture.

- Adam Herring, Shimmering Foundation: The Twelve-Angled Stone of Inca Cusco, Critical Inquiry, Autumn 2010.

**Edit:**  Several comments questioned my use of "nearly a thousand years." Here's where I got that figure: according to wikipedia, Cusco was founded in 1100, and then occupied by the Inca "from the 13th Century to the 16th Century." I have no idea when that particular stone was laid, but it seems to have been somewhere between 500 and 900 years ago.  I was intentionally vague with the date, since I don't know the exact century. I've also seen suggestions that it predates the Inca. If someone has that info, I'd appreciate you commenting with it!

**Edit 2:**  Just out of curiosity, I went through and counted: as of right now, there are 54 top-level comments jokingly asserting that this was aliens.  There are 17 top-level comments that are literally just the word "aliens."  In the time it took me to count, 4 more were added.

If there's one thing I've realised, it's that humans a thousand (or more) years ago were just as intelligent as we are today. Sure they didn't have anything like the technology we have, but they were just as skilled and had equally rich and complex lives as those we have today.
Meanwhile, [last week...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O38QHzM0tzw/S-YAkoeP58I/AAAAAAAAB20/7FQ5sd8tv7k/s1600/IMG_1133.JPG)

Quick Background before comment:  I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Architecture.  My thesis specifically focused on the integration of 3D printing technologies into masonry construction, using ancient approaches as a basis for design.

Now.  Something to know about these masonry walls is that they are not nearly as intricate and "perfect" as they appear to be.  From the outside (the face), the stones are chiseled using the surrounding stone as a basis.  On the interior of the wall, however, you will find that each of these stones is more "wedge" shaped, and is held in place with a plethora of smaller "filler rocks."  

From the outside, it looks impossible.  Once you look inside, you'll find that it's really just as simple as shaping one side of the rock, just along the edges.
Peru was an amazing country to visit, I thoroughly enjoyed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. Some of the most amazing scenery. Anyone who has thought about going to Peru, fucking do it, spend at least a month there there's so much to see!

On a side note, I can't stand the ancient aliens bull shit. I don't think we give nearly enough credit to ancient peoples and their intelligence and ingenuity.

[Bonus picture of me heel-clicking on Machu Picchu](http://imgur.com/Is8elgx)

Edit I spelled stuff wrong
It's amazing what your can do when you literally have nothing else to do.
The tops rocks would have been added after this one, unlike the title says, right?
They explained how this was done pretty well on Ancient Aliens. Turns out it was aliens.
Wouldn't the mortar just blow it up?

I know Washington State has declared a state of emergency and are calling volunteers to work the fires. They have maxed out all fire fighting resources. 
I guess over 3000 volunteers have joined the fight. 

Oregon is in the same shape. I have heard that with both states combined over 1 million acres have burned.
Is that the best place for him to be resting? Looks like there are flames right behind him.
Not to disturb your well-earned rest, but there's, uh, some by your left shoulder, bro...
Quite literally the entire north west is covered in smoke right now. I live in Portland and it looks like the apocalypse right now. The sky is yellow and you can't see more than like 75meters. Which is pretty bad when you think about the fact it's smoke. 
In some areas of PORTLAND the amount of smoke is deemed Unhealthy. I can't imagine living where the fires actually are.
It looks like Shingai here. 
My memories of working 32 hours straight, i remember entering my apartment, then it's a blank, i didn't even get to bed, i just sat down on in my couch and woke up 10 hours later.
so much respect for firefighters. Dude has thoroughly earned his rest 

I'm from Australia where we get bushfires relatively often so I can really epathise with him. [Heres a picture from our knackered firies](http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Aussie-fire-1.jpg)
Is this dangerous to be posting online where the firefighters are? What if the fire is watching?
I'm far west of the fires and the smoke rolled in today. It was smothering. Made my nose and throat burn after standing outside for 30 minutes. Hats off to this guy and the other men and women working to control these fires. 
I am the daughter and granddaughter of Aussie bush firefighters, married to a former elite firey who left his career after the [Black Saturday fires](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=black+saturday&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=620&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIkeagpZ6_xwIVYi-mCh0Xnwd2&dpr=1.25).  
Friends still in the game are now one their way from Australia to the US to lend a hand.  We understand sleeping where you sit, seeking out the fire-warmed rocks to sleep on when it gets cold at night, the bonds of mateship that form under the constant threat.  
Best wishes to all the crews out on the line and those who are supporting them. 

I doubt he'd quit even if you told him to. The world needs more guys like this. 
I'm sure his family is worried about him.

These guys are Forest Service.  I fought fires for Washington DNR back in the 80s.  Often the first attack crews will be on the fire until the project is organized, crews arrive and the strategy is organized.  This can take over 24 hours (much of that is travel times for the crews to arrive).  After that the crews are sceduled 12 hrs on/off.  You don't want arriving crews to just run in and start working without a plan.

The longest initial attack I was on lasted 28 hours.  When it was my turn to service the pump I fell asleep, sitting on it.  The pump was still running.

At the level these crews are running at there's not much to stop your brains for shutting you down.
hope he got more than just a cat nap.   He obviously needs it if he can go to sleep within mere feet of ground fires.
Thats not how wildland works. It is a point of pride amongst these men and women to work past the breaking point. There are precious few people that are willing to do work of that difficulty for so long. It's a matter of pride, discipline, and dedication.
After posting this on facebook I just found out this is a friend of mine. Holy shit. This man is NOT Forest Service! He is a volunteer firefighter. He splits his time between two local fire districts. He is also an EMT for our district. 
I see a lot of funny comments on this post, but lets just take a second to realize how hard these guys are busting their asses to make sure other people will be safe and have a place to live while this guy hasn't been home in over a day.
I live in Oregon, and the smoke here is fucking ridiculous. There's a fire burning by a town that's about a twenty minute drive away from me, and then there's everything coming down from Washington. They're advising for people to go outside as little as possible due to unhealthy air conditions.
Can't say enough good about these folks. Much love from the Chelan Complex area.
That is one tough job. And incredibly dangerous. We had a bad drought the previous weeks here, but luckily, nothing burned. 
I've worked shifts like this where you are just go for 30+ hours. The first second your body gets to shut down it will. 
I live in Bellingham WA. Just a little while west of where all this is happening. It's kinda eerie how smokey it is outside. 
Is there a way to donate water bottles or something to these guys?

That is far cooler than you must have expected. Nice work! You should serious by a hundred of those dresses and tie-dye them all, then sell them at farmer's markets.
What you can't see from this potato salad picture is the rest of the pattern. There's a whole external lacy layer, but only this specific part of the lace was cotton, evidently. [This](http://i.imgur.com/4kepHXN.jpg) is a close up on the material, where you can see the distinction.

It's to dye for! 
I'd buy the fuck out of that
I would like to see it on, please. Not in a creepy way, but in an "I want to see that dress worn" way. 

If you..y'know...know what I'm saying? I guess.


That's fancy ! Do you have a pic of what it looked like before ?
Is that really what those little plastic loops on a hanger are for?
Ugh. It's white and gold isn't it.
Hey, you're back! I thought you had quit Reddit. 

Awesome job on the dress, too.
I had no idea who you were before this post, but according to others, you're a reddit celebrity. I was curious why, so I read your post history.

****You're hilarious.****

I'm a huge fan of your art style and your jokes. Even if they weren't on your nub, they'd still be entertaining. You should sketch more if you have the time and motivation! 
That's pretty awesome looking. 
looks great! I've done my share of tie dye work (thousands of items). Your color work is on point keep up the good work.
This is begging to be worn to a pride festival! 
Everything went better than expected!
I want it. 
If this isn't a thing it's gonna become a thing.
Sometimes I click on something, thinking it's going to be cool, and it's cool. But other times it's not as cool as I'd hoped. But then sometimes I click on something and it's way cooler than I ever imagined it could be. This is one of those times. Nice job. 
Seriously I don't get this post. Could someone please explain?
OH THAT IS SICK.
Why don't you start making more and selling them? I'd buy one off of you. /lazy

I was once part of an investigation squad and we knew the suspect had a dog of a breed that can be pretty dangerous, so we were alert. 

Well, in the end the dog was following us around with his frisbee, trying to engage everyone to play. 
"Beware of Dog... kisses"
He got a tongue and he will use it!
Aww I wanna cuddle the cute doggy 
The sign isn't for you. 

It's for him.

Because he's like Superman. Always has to watch his strength or he could hurt someone.

*Beware of dog*
/r/blop
Seriously though, beware of any dog you don't know. 

Too many people think "lookit the liddle blep! I'mma poke it!" Suddenly, you're in the dog's space and he's defensive, and the dog gets put down instead of the asshole who didn't beware of the fucking dog. 

90% of dogs would be okay with a pet in that situation. 10% would not. Don't risk it. 
Sadly this is probably for insurance purposes. Most companies ask what type of dog you have and if it belongs to one of the groups they feel are an issue they will ask if your yard is fenced and if you have a sign. This keeps your premiums from going up much higher than if you didn't have a sign or fence. Some municipalities also require it as well. I have several GSD's and my insurance agent about died when I exclaimed I didn't intend to fence my entire property. I told him they're all trained and won't hurt anyone unless commanded to. They didn't like that and tried to raise my rates so I just moved to a better carrier.
"As long as you throw the ball, no one will get hurt" 
Hey, that looks like my dog.

http://imgur.com/a/LyoL6
He's a dangerous dog. A very dangerous dog. Yes he is. Oh yes he is. Aren't you boy? Oh yes you are.
Bloop
What kind of dog?
Reminds me of a dog my roommates used to own. 

It was a miniature dachshund, I think her breed were known for being particularly nasty but this dog was the sweetest thing. 

She loved everything and everyone except one thing: The doorbell, her dreaded enemy. 

The doorbell going off was one of the few times we heard her bark. This dog was about 6-7 pounds at most but when she barked she sounded like she was the size of a husky.

It was the funniest thing, watching canvassers ring the bell and get this look of complete horror when the heard the barking. The look on their faces when they saw it was coming from a mini-dachshund was priceless.
Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!
I had a Siberian Husky that looked like a wolf. He was built like a machine, and looked ferocious, which was nice because I lived in a place kind of sketchy at night.

Twice my house was broken into with my giant direwolf downstairs & both times my dog barked & scared off the intruders.   
Instead of going to attack them, he was just saying "Look at me" then prancing towards him like a bubbly giant puppy hoping for head scratches.

People would cross the street to not have to walk near him, and he would bark trying to say "Hey, I'm friendly please pat me on the head" but everyone was scared of the love bug. Now I have a Shiba Inu & she's more of a guard dog than my Husky ever was.
Seems as if he's trying to look at his own tongue and has gone cross-eyed. Like you do if you try to look at your own nose.
The baddies are being lulled into a false sense of security, if they dare to hop the gate, evil pooch is hiding ready to pounce.
:p
That's no ordinary dog.  That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered canine you ever set eyes on. That dog's got a vicious streak a mile wide, it's a killer!
aw looks so cute xD 
False advertising.
I fart in your general direction!
Beware of mlem
I will beware of the dog. I am constantly aware of all dogs.

How long before this an option on instagram?
Before anyone asks, the code has not been released [yet](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/637399418711486464), though there has been an [attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3imx1m/a_neural_algorithm_of_artistic_style/cujnlnr?context=1) to replicate it.

**Edit:** [An implimentation is now available on GitHub.](https://github.com/kaishengtai/neuralart) The same guy [tweeted](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/638365139109068800) again about it, saying it "seems to work nicely! sometimes :)"

Computer, one art please!
Can we make a robot that runs on wine and talks shit about these paintings?
Tübingen! I lived there! It's gorgeous!! 
I recognize Starry Night and The Scream, but what are the other paintings?
As a salary-paid working artist I can't deny how exciting this is. Peoples first thoughts are obviously 'lol welp artists aren't needed', and to some very small corner of our industry, that may be true. But for me, I'm always looking for a new tool to speed up my workflow and this has incredible potential. A lot of times it's easier to stitch together photographs in interesting ways (called photobashing) instead of making a painting from scratch. I could see great situations where you spend time making one painting that has all the unique styling and flavor (a style frame or 'alpha' image ). Then spending the rest of your time making quick photo stitched illustrations not worrying about the final look, but focusing on the idea. When you've captured whatever ideas in your series of images, how cool would it be to input your 'alpha' image and let the neural network do its thing to the other photo-based illustrations. These are really exciting times!
HA HA and the artist thought their jobs were protected from the machines.

Edit: I know artist are important it was a joke guys.
The town depicted is Tübingen, Germany. Just saying, because its a small and irrelevant Town, people go to to study, but not much more :D damn people are smart here.. Nice pics too :D
From a programming point of view this make me moist.
ITT: "it's Tübingen"
Tübingen! I lived there for a year
Haha I lived in "A" for a couple of years! It's Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg for those who are interested.
It doesn't seem like it recreates the photo with the style, it just seems like it attempts to recreate the photo AS the painting. You can see this most clearly in D, where the further half of the houses don't exist because in the painting there's just sky. Hell half of a house is still in the painting; it just seems to end half way through. It's still interesting, but I think you'd need some kind of AI to actually paint a photo in the painter's style like this tried to do.  
This is probably going to get buried, but this article is very relevant:

It doesn't look like it works well with many images, just ones that have a similar composition.
I threw a subreddit together for when tools become available. If you want to talk about, share results, and develop image style transfer tools you're welcome to stop by:

What happens when you use the Van Gogh style on Starry Night? Do you get (Van Gogh)^2?
wow this is my home town! If anyone is wondering this is Tübingen in Germany and it's taken from the Neckarbrücke.

The picture is actually taken from wikipedia:

Yay for our future distopia! Awesome!
What does neural mean when it comes to this?
This is a taste of the (relatively) new field of "non-photorealistic imaging" from computer science.  Computers can make things photo-realistic (see this [Morgan Freeman video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEdRLlqdgA4)), but it's very difficult to make images appear as paintings. 

There have been great advances in this technology.  Does anyone remember the Keanu Reeves "cartoon" movie, [A Scanner Darkly] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY5PpGQ2OWY)?  Here is a 2006 [paper] (http://kucg.korea.ac.kr/seminar/2008/src/PA-07-12.pdf) that describes how they do this in real time.  It's not that difficult for a computer; the basic steps are:

- Get the "Difference of Gaussian" line edges (find edges in the picture)
- Make a line drawing of the image from the above step
- Fill in the colors by doing a "Luminance Quantiziation"; the simple explanation is the computer divides the colors up into, say, 100 different shades.  Then, for each pixel, decide which shade to "round" to.  This gives a "cartoony" feel to the image
- Done!

Again, this is something that can be done in REAL TIME; it doesn't take a lot of processing to execute (Source: I did something very similar for my graduate work).

The images posted above are more complex.  For paintings, it gets a lot more complicated simply because of the vastly different styles.  Each painter had his/her own unique painting style such that one image can be interpreted so many different ways.  It's impossible to list all the different work in this field, but here are some papers which describe how we got the images posted:

- [Mean Curvature Flow] (http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0729052)
- [Flow-based bilateral filter] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.5240&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- [Non-linear diffusion] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56205&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D56205)

There really are a TON more papers and the ones listed are relevant to the images posted.  Suffice to say, this is an emerging field, and while not "perfect", we are getting closer to non-photorealistic images.

If there's more interest, I'm happy to provide additional examples or (attempt) to explain the theory behind them!  This is an exciting time to work in digital images!

I wonder what their reasoning is in destroying all these ancient artifacts . If Mohammad himself didn't feel the need to destroy them and countless other Islamic military forces left them alone why are these sites now suddenly an afront to Islam?
Maybe we should arm a militia of tenured university professors. Their rage at the cultural atrocities committed by ISIS should more than make up for their lack of youth.
[Heres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra) the wiki page if you want to learn more about the city and its history. This isn't a small village of mud huts and pillars,its a massive area and an important part of human history.
Those ISIS guys are real dickheads.
I went to Palmyra when I was a kid with my dad. It eventually led to me doing a masters in history. I've always wanted to go back, one day. This makes me sad.
I'm starting to think these ISIS guys might be jerks.
*When you're going for a cultural victory but Gandhi just wants to conquer you*
The Empire of Palmyra and it's kings/queens and armies were the equal of the mighty Roman Empire in the 3rd century. These ISIS scumbags would have been a band of squabbling brigands in front of Palmyra's armies. Now, they dare to use the destructive low-life methods of the day to destroy the marks of that greatness. Even in the defenseless, silent death of  millennia, the mere buildings of the Kingdom of Palmyra are greater that ISIS will ever become. They will never build anything, with all of their effort, remotely close to the ancient city or it's history.
Ya know... even Hitler, for all of his bullshit, was like "let's not bomb Oxford, because that would be a really dick move". 

ISIS is literally worse than Hitler.
It was destroyed a month ago. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-temple-at-palmyra-destroyed-in-isis-attack/
The fuckd part is that they strip all the valuable artifacts to sell and then destroy it claiming some sort of religious thing they think is real.
Bunch of fucktards. Someone please blow them all up. 
Seriously. Fuck those guys.
Reminds me of when somebody knocks down your sandcastle on the beach. That horrible, sneering look on their face as they deliberately destroy it for no other reason than to upset you. They know that you're powerless to stop them.

Of course, in this case it's on a much larger scale :P
No room for these animals in civilization
FUCK ISIS. 
The Taliban did this shit with the Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001. I remember how people spoke about how awful it was but were silent about the murdered Christians and girls stoned to death for showing some ankle.
Everyone hates when America gets involved, and then you get comments and threads full of "blow them up."

What does the world want? America to police the world or not? Is your country incapable of fucking these idiots up?

We can't win. We really can't.

It is a great burden to send your own boys and girls into the claws of death only to have the rest of the world scoff "American Imperalists."

Heidentor (heathen's gate) in [Carnuntum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnuntum), an old Roman camp in Austria.
Is that the only one there, or are there more around showing different angles of the site?  Because that would be cool if there were different views.
It's a good way to visualize history. [Here's a picture I took at the Dachau Concentration Camp in Germany.](http://i.imgur.com/rlgHfxf.jpg)
Very cool, though even with the outlines, I'm still curious what this structure's actual function was. It doesn't seem large enough to be a market/shelter/place of worship. A landmark maybe?
"Like" is redundant in the title, it can be omitted.
If you stop and think about it our sense of nostalgia and history really is an odd thing.  Like if something is old we don't like it until it reaches a certain tipping point then we love it and make it illegal to destroy.

1000 years from now there's going to be abandoned shopping centers that are federally protected and people trying to restore them to their original condition.
I'd love to see this done using augmented reality, where my cell phone is like a window into the past.
I just got back from Rome last week - Our tour guide for the Colosseum/Forum had a book full of things like this.

One of the few souvenirs I bought on the trip.
Oh man, Detroit could totally use this technology! 
Wikipedia has some interesting images of how it looked like in the past:

[Here is an image of what it looked like in 1840](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Heidentor_%28Stich%29.jpg) and here is an [image made in 1655](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Heidentor_c_beuttler.jpg).

It is amazing to realize that the latter picture, that is over a century older than the USA, was made when the monument was already a ruin over a millennium old.
wooops!  Looks like the builders colored outside of the lines.
They would be funny if they drew in some drunk Roman guy passed out against the wall of the building 
Wait, is that... is that "Real Life augmented Reality"? That is a great idea!
In one of M.J.Fox's movie, when he was about to build an own hotel, he used the same idea. I always wondered why this isn't more frequently in open areas
Great idea, want to see more of this in Rome. So, how do they know what it originally looked like?  It's been in ruins for a thousand years and not like they had pictures to go off
A little more info on the display:

This display at Carnuntum is the only one of its kind on this site. It is even meant as a temporary display since sooner or later the Heidentor (heathen's gate) is supposed to be rebuilt following original Roman building style.

They have a very nice museum at the excavation site nearby where they already have a few fully functional Roman buildings that were rebuilt in the original style and with original materials.

Carnuntum is a fascinating excavation site with a very cleverly built museum which constantly improves.

During summer they have some festivities there and at their sister site "Bad Deutsch Altenburg". They show Gladiator fights, Roman army training, Roman lifestyle in general.

The site is about half an hour drive from Vienna and definitely worth a visit. Entry fees are moderate and the ticket is valid for the three main sites: Museum Carnuntum, Museum Bad Deutsch Altenburg, and the "Amphitheater" Bad Deutsch Altenburg.
What if ruins have always been in the state they are now? Like they were built as a way to engage a ruse on the future generations.
It kinda irks me that it isn't exactly lined up
For anyone wondering, the word "Augenhöhe" on the ride side means eye height, so you get a feeling for how big the ruin was
How they looked.  What they looked like.
This is a very informative view. Wouldn't it be cool to have a holographic device fill in the missing areas, so that the structure could be seen as it would have appeared?
I love stuff like this. I've always been fascinated with how things used to look as apposed to today.
Now you just have to hope the tourists are smart enough to line up the two 
I would've loved something like that when I visited the ruins of the Temple of Artemis,  there is only so much one can do with imagination only. http://i.imgur.com/pmdYrru.jpg

We had a younger raccoon who would come out during the day, give himself/herself elaborate baths, and sunbathe. Humongous mom would then join him later and they'd go to hang out in their night spot.

I asked the vet about the behavior because I was worried about my dog (even though he has his shots) and they said that while it *could* mean that they're sick, some just like to do stuff during the day. so it doesn't necessarily mean they're sick.

He/she and the mom moved on and I kind of miss watching that fat little fuck. It was adorable.

I think there is some misconception about WHY Folsom Lake is as low as it is. Cal. Dept. of Water Resources is letting out so much water from the lake in order to keep salinity levels of the delta in check. When they dropped the flow down too far, salt water from the San Francisco Bay started to creep in. There are multiple reasons for this, one being environmental (the Delta Smelt...) and irrigation purposes. Although it's part of it, California, or rather, Folsom and Sacramento, are NOT drinking this lake dry.

As a Sacramentonian, we joke that it's Folsom pond instead of Folsom lake.

Except now there's not even water to joke about.

Edit: Good-bye inbox; thank you all fellow SACRAMENTONIANS (I will call us what I darn-tootin' well please). This was fun. Time to go wallow in the American creek. Conserve water, drink beer.
I thought kids floated?
Never thought I would see Folsom, CA on the front page. 
/r/californiaswater
Meanwhile in south Florida, there hasn't been a single day in months where we haven't had at least six inches of rain. It's been torrential the world is ending rain every single day since at least April. 
As someone who grew up on Folsom lake this is a horrifying shot.. I used to go here as a kid and always saw the water go down but this is terrifying. Guess I won't be going back to Sacramento anytime soon
The kids can still play on the beach, just without the splashing around in water part...
Looks like New Vegas
I'd be metal detecting the hell out of that place
"No lifeguard on duty...*forever*"
It's worth pointing out that people only used to swim there because some people dug a reservoir and dammed a river. It's not a natural lake. California has been living on borrowed water for a long time. No one should be surprised when the bill comes due.
Drought is part of the natural water cycle in California. Yes, people expanded to where they shouldn't have, without better backup systems in place. Yes, we are have a particularly bad drought right now.

I don't exactly know how this cultural attitude changed, but people scoff at big projects these days. Covering the CA aquaduct with solar panels, for instance. Or William Shatner's proposed super-long pipeline. Folks should also look up NAWAPA, a plan in the 50's to do man-made water distribution throughout the western US. Hell, even William Shatner proposed a super-long pipeline of a similar nature.

Astonishingly, the notion of long pipelines immediately invokes visions of science fiction in people's minds. Then when you point out that the petrochem industry makes *colossal* pipelines all the time, that is somehow considered irrelevant.

I will immediately betray what I said above, though: this isn't a usual cycle, and we are seeing something change. The Salton Sea was left to die, and it is have a ripple effect in the ecosystem all along the coast. The desertification of the LA region was essentially halted with the creation of the Salton Sea 100 years ago. The existence of the sea sustained weather systems that made the LA region much more livable. Now that the sea is essentially gone, the greater LA area is undergoing a drastic desertification, with soaring temperatures and exposure.

The sea could be saved, too, but again, people scoff at it. A 90 mile seawater pipeline could be built from the Gulf of California to refill the Salton Sea. Cost estimates are somewhere in the $500m-1b range. Scoffing ensues, but you can look at school districts that issues bonds in the hundreds-of-millions range that are just absorbed into people's pockets. If you listen to Eisenhower and compare to military spending, $1b is a small investment compare to military build-up.

... and seawater is actually less salty than the Sea is now! The Sea is 200 feet below sea level, and the pipeline could be passive, if designed correctly. There is a huge dry lake bed in Mexico that could be refilled to an artificial sea, too, if the pipeline was properly built. A little tricky, since it is 80 feet above seal level, but by coupling it to to the -200ft Salton Sea siphon could also make this a passive benefit.

Even if pumping was added, solar or thermal collectors could be added along the length of the pipe, thus making it zero net energy. The economic benefit alone to both countries would likely offset the cost within a decade. The biggest problem would be dealing with Mexico, now that they are a essentially a failed nation.
Kids these days have no imagination.

It's from [National Geographic's Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDAE7w7oVTl/?taken-by=natgeo&hl=en) - this guy is a master's student at BYU, is studying black bears, and went into the den armed "with only a short aluminum pole attached to a tranquilizer dart. The tunnel was only as big as the bear with no escape except a very quick 50 foot backwards crawl should he decide to charge." 
[That bear.](http://i.imgur.com/JWNum3j.png)
"Oh, now you fucked up." -Bear
I'm his brother, He is the man. I was in there with him when we drugged the bear and 20 ft in we could see its eyes looking back at us (the hole was about 80ft long). Scariest/coolest thing I've ever willing done. We both spent a summer trapping these bears together, check us out at @grizkid and @jefe_larson on Instagram 

Side note, the drugged bear walked all of the way out of the den and we had to physically stop it until it fell asleep so that it would get hurt or lost while on the drug
"Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour, Ursa Major?"
That poor bear is scared as hell.  It can't run away and is backed up into the far end of the den.  It has to be the equivalent of an alien abduction for the thing. 

There I was asleep in my bed, when suddenly there was a bright light on my bedroom, and this little pink creature stabbed me with this weird claw on a stick.  I tried to run away but he had me cornered. As he closed the distance between us I tried to fight him off, but I must have blacked out afterwards, and then I woke up with another device implanted in my neck. I went to the bear doctor to have the last one removed, but they were only able to partially remove it. I'm really scared, and I don't feel like I'm in control of my life. 

Edit: typos. 
Well, at least that guys gonna go on to win an oscar
ITT: only jokes. What actually happened, is the guy ok?
That bear had no idea he was about to fuck with a man wearing plaid
Meanwhile, on Bear Reddit. Bear OP posts a photo of man in plaid in his hole "Oh... Uh... Hi". 
"I don't need to crawl faster than the bear, just faster than this guy in front of me" - some photographer

Unfortunately for this home invader, he is practicing his right to bear arms.

This one moment at the end of your life when you know that you are fucked.

But why is this bear wering a collar?
Hey. So, um. Your alarm has gone off like 5 times, and uh. I was wondering if you were going to get up. BUT it's cool if you dont. Uh I'm just going to leave now. Sleep tight. #bearroommateproblems
now that's a situation.
Reminds me of the air duct scene in Aliens, that must have been pretty terrifying.
Bear: "I came to let you know you left your stove on. I turned it off for you. You're welcome. Also, I ate your wife sorry."

I went to Norway, especially Lofoten where that picture was taken. It's seriously fucking beautiful. I hiked up one of the mountains. Hiking up the mountain it felt like I died and was in heaven. Fresh cool air, sea breeze, the midnight sun, the clouds breaking over the mountain peaks, the wildflowers, the ferns, I could go on and on. It was basically an arctic rainforest because everything was so wet and overgrown with vegetation. There was fresh water everywhere, I did not have to worry about my water supply. Camped in a random clearing. Probably the best day of my life.

2nd best day would be the 8 hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo. Every minute of that 8 hour train ride has an /r/earthporn front page worthy view, for real. Listened to some Sigur Ros and it was just perfect.

edit: great lofoten travel information site made by a hiker: 68north.com

The debris over the cars seem to have come from the building on the right, you can see damage to the roof. Crane must have bounced right off
Crane operator here!

After a bit of sleuth work I've found the load charts for the crane in the accident. From the information I've found the crane is a Leibherr LR1300 with 555' of boom. 
https://www.coastcrane.com/docs/default-source/lr1300/lr1300---2316-luffing-jib-capacity-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=2
Looking over the manual, with the configuration this crane was running, it was a limit of 15 mph winds. Reports are there were easily 30mph gusts(probably more between this buildings). 
This is all based on speculation and none of it is a fact, just felt like looking into it. Glad it wasn't worse than what it was!


I lived in NYC for a long time, and this is one of those things that I just never think about.  So many buildings are always under construction, and so many cranes are just sitting above you.

It's terrifying to think about. 

EDIT:  I changed "we" to "I" fine.  I said we cause anyone I've talked to about this didn't give it much thought either.

My kids loved him, have quite a few pictures of him with them. Im really broken up about it, and I think the worst part is that they'll never know because you don't just go off half cocked and tell kids that batman is dead.

Link to the story

[HERE is a link to the story the OP is referring to.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/route-29-batman-is-killed-after-his-car-breaks-down-along-a-maryland-highway/2015/08/17/13f0e9b2-44e3-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html)

A regular guy who selflessly brought joy to sick children.

RIP man.  I'm really sorry to hear of his passing.

I think it would be nice if the makers of the Batman games and movies gave him a nod.

He was a real hero.
Waking up to learn there's one less hero in the world made me suddenly feel very tired again. Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.
So he pulled onto the left shoulder, but his car was still partially in the lane and somebody hit him. I wonder if his hazards were on, because that car is jet black and would be really hard to spot at night.
I met this guy last year almost to the day. My daughter has a leg length discrepancy and we were at a specialist hospital in Baltimore and he was there giving all the kids lanyards and huge coloring books. We were really looking forward to seeing him again next month when we went back. R.I.P.
According to the stories I've read, Mr. Robinson would stop by the nurse's station before he left to find out if there were any children too sick to come out to see him, so that he could make sure to go in to see them specifically.

That's the key to his character.  This wasn't about attention or fame or publicity or promoting some cause of business.  We wouldn't know who this guy was if he hadn't gotten a speeding ticket and accidentally gone viral.  He kept right on doing the same thing after he got famous as he did before he got famous.  And the most important thing to him was that sick kid who wasn't able to come out to see him.

Bruce Wayne is a fiction; an entertaining fiction, but a fiction.  Lenny Robinson was a real man who is a role model for thoughtfulness, selflessness, and making a difference in a small way.

Batman was real, and his name was Lenny Robinson.
Here is a video of Lenny visiting sick kids in the hospital.  He truly was a hero deserving of the name, Batman.  The world is a darker place without him.   RIP Batman.

https://youtu.be/fDDBJajLZww
Lenny was in a documentary called Legends of the Knight that is on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/80014903) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/795787), if anyone wants to check out his story and see him in action. It's about people who use Batman as an inspiration for themselves or others.

Seeing the kids respond to him is incredible. The world lost a great man.
Batman taken out by a Toyota Camry.  This world is fucked up.
Too bad it wasn't [this guy instead](http://i.imgur.com/IMc8Kiv.jpg)
A tad late to things, but Lenny was actually very close to one of my best friends and his family. A group of my friends (whom all play SSBM together, shouts out to /r/smashbros and the Melee Community) all learned of Lenny's passing this morning straight from our buddy. Although the loss was hard for him and his family, I feel its important to highlight the good that Lenny put into this world. Admittedly, I did not know Lenny nearly as closely as my friend or his family, but I do recall a very specific memory I had with Lenny a couple years ago. At my friend's Bar Mitzvah Lenny was there decked out in full batman attire. He was a class act by all definitions, and went out of his way to make sure every kid, myself included had a memorable experience. An entertaining, genuine, loving individual, Lenny aka Uncle Batman will be missed. RIP Uncle Batman. He was a hero this world needed.

Proof: My friend, the dopest Marth/Fox main in the world with his partner in justice Uncle Batman. Although they weren't technically related, Lenny was considered part of his family.

If I'm taken out

by a Toyota Camry,

...so help me jesus
If there is an afterlife, he's going to the good side of town. He clearly lived a cool life if he had the money to buy a lambo and a batsuit. He then had the heart to use that for a greater good and in the process gave us all some laughs. RIP Lenny.
Such a shame, my son was in a children's hospital and this gentleman was there with his 60's Batmobile that he had recently purchased and was driving back east with.  Got some pics of the [Batmobile](http://i.imgur.com/nKnRe63.jpg?1) and my son still has his [autograph](http://i.imgur.com/XlrPgMI.jpg) hanging up in his room.  
He not only put some smiles on the kids faces but also everyone at the hospital that went out to check out the car.  He was the Hero we needed that day.
*batman voice* just here in my garage, with my new Lamborghini that I bought. Fun to drive around Gotham. You know what I like better than Lamborghini's...JUSTICE
Thats terrible. He's more of a hero than the guy he was dressed as and probably never realized it. 
RIP Lenny. You were a Batman among men.
i live in maryland. i can not tell you how many times since i got my license over 20 years ago now,  the countless people that have been killed by their cars breaking down and them getting out and standing near their car on the side of the road, attempting to change a flat tire, or are under the hood checking the engine. 95 percent of the time these people are safely out of the driving lanes and yet people still manage to hit them. im telling you now for anyone who doesnt know about maryland: 

MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.

ive never seen worse drivers. and ive lived in huge cities. it is the worst here for accidents like this one. it is the reason why we have the highest insurance rates in the united states. if you have the unfortunate problem of living here or for some ungodly reason decide to visit here as a tourist im going to give you a little advice: 

- IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDIAN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE WALL, AND IF THERE IS GRASS BY THE MEDIAN PULL ALL THE WAY OVER INTO THE GRASS!

- NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR CAR ON A MARYLAND HIGHWAY TO CHANGE A TIRE OR LOOK AT YOUR ENGINE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  IF YOU HAVE A FLAT DRIVE IT ON THE SIDE MEDIAN UNTIL YOU CAN FIND AN EXIT. EVEN IF IT MEANS DAMAGING YOUR RIM. YOUR RIM IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE. 

- IF IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR CANNOT BE FIXED DO NOT SIT IN YOUR CAR WAITING UNTIL HELPS ARRIVES!! EVEN IF YOU ARE SAFELY OFF TO THE SIDE. PEOPLE HERE WILL STILL HIT YOU! GET OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE AND STAND AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENCING, BUT YOU'LL BE ALIVE. PEOPLE DIE IN THEIR CARS HERE ALL THE TIME SITTING IN THEM WAITING FOR HELP OR A TOW TRUCK. 

again i reiterate, MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.  take every precaution you can if your car breaks down on a highway here. 
And a positive light in the world goes out. sad day. 
Met this guy in person when a psychology practice with which I'm affiliated co-produced a batman documentary. He was a hero who happened to dress up like another hero.

Legit cried when I learned of his passing.
*We die every day. A thousand times an hour. Anyone who does this work sees it. Death. Their own... their partner's... their loved ones. We go to work anyway. Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind. Death is powerless against you if you do your job.*
- Batman, JLA Vol 1 72
Karma did the opposite here. What a shame. 
The person who caused his death needs to do the right thing and take over for Lenny Robinson as Batman.
>Elizabeth later told him that she was being bullied by other kids at her elementary school. They dont believe that Batman is my friend, she told him.  So, Robinson went to school with her, appearing in full costume before the student body. He told them bullying was wrong and called her onstage to give her a Batman necklace.  Elizabeth, he announced, is my friend.

This part of the story made the waterworks begin.

The water's clean, it's the garbage in it that is dirty.

Edit: thanks for my first gold, stranger!
Wow. That's really fucking depressing. 
The upside is that there's got to be an Adam Sandler movie in all of this. 

Synopsis: when every athlete in the world pulls out of the Rio olympics, unemployed schmuck (Sandler) decides to fulfil his dreams of winning Olympic gold by competing in, and winning, every single gold medal on offer.
The governor is almost as full of shit as Guanabara Bay.
What are the athletes saying about all this? I did a quick google search and didnt find much. It just seems like the news is being buried.
I'm on the aussie national rowing team this year.

I have given three years of my life to trying to make the Games. Give me a 2k course made of liquid shit and I'll row down it.
That truly is the cleanest, loveliest cesspool I have seen in ages.
It's not trash, it's an obstacle course!
And that's how an entire generation of Olympic athletes contracted hepatitis. 
Seems like they need a [Mr. Trash Wheel](http://baltimorewaterfront.com/healthy-harbor/water-wheel/)

(the guy did an AMA, [here is the link to that](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3pidal/i_am_mr_trash_wheel_the_first_invention_of_its/))
That's like fresh spring water compared to some of the bodies of water here in China. Emphasis on bodies. I've seen several dogs a'floatin

The athletes will be competing at the mouth of the bay where the water is supposedly cleaner: http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21693983-zika-will-not-be-much-threat-rio-games-olympic-oasis
An absolutely perfect source for Zika...and Dengue
When was this picture taken?
That reminds me of [Terry Pratchett's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett) river Ankh:

> The Ankh is a river serpenting through the Sto Plains, reaching the Circle Sea by the town of Ankh-Morpork. By then, it can only be called a river because it moves faster than the banks. You can't drown in the Ankh, but it is really easy to suffocate.

> It has been said that the Ankh is the only river in the multiverse where cops can draw a chalk outline when a corpse is found. 

>There is a legend in Ankh-Morpork of an ancient drum in the palace that will bang itself if ever an enemy fleet is seen sailing up the Ankh, although the legend has died out in recent centuries, partly because it's the Age of Reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the Ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front.
There's something alive in there! 
http://imgur.com/QOae9Vb
As a Brazilian: if you're thinking of coming here - for the Olympics or otherwise - **DON'T.** The reasons why are too many to mention here, but rest assured that the water in the Guanabara bay should be the least of your concerns.  


Edit: I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but that flashy building behind is one of the many overpriced white elephants our corrupt government has built with money that should be put to better use, built especially for the Olympics. It's called the Museum of Tomorrow, and it supposedly has something to do with sustainable devopment. [This](http://odia.ig.com.br/noticia/rio-de-janeiro/2015-12-20/mar-de-lixo-tomou-conta-da-praca-maua.html) is how my countrymen left the place *on the day of it's inauguration*. (The link is in portuguese, but there's pictures. Use Google Translate).  


I toyed with the idea of making a long, well researched post detailing why people shouldn't come here, or shouldn't support our corrupt government with your travel money, but the research made me too depressed. Just Google shit. Zika virus, Dengue and Chikungunya are as endemic as corruption in all levels of government, the violence in Rio makes Detroit look like EuroDisney, I could go on and on and on... The police is utterly corrupt and incompetent. I'm sure you can find the horror stories of tourists in Brazil for yourselves, so I won't bother.  


I hate it here. Brazil sucks. Our government sucks, but the government is a reflection of the people, and the people suck too. The pictures of our 'Museum of Tomorrow' should tell you all you need to know. Don't come. I'd leave if I could. **DON'T COME**
So isn't the whole world gonna see this when it gets televised?
I've heard a lot from athletes in the news. They're getting sick during practice
Jesus, it's not like we share the planet with other living things. I just want to cry when I see things like that. 
Read this as Guantanamo Bay. Am disappointed 
This is the immune system challenge. Something tells me that India is going to win the gold. Their front runner grew up swimming, drinking, pissing, and shitting in the Ganges river.
They'll just exploit workers like they did 4 years ago. It'll look nice for a few days, people will be abused and not paid after making sacrifices for a paycheck, and it'll look great  on television.
This shit show will be so fun to watch

What always struck me about Egypt when I visited was that the COLOR was still on so many of the glyphs.  Think about this for a second.  Someone 5 THOUSAND years ago potentially, on some specific day, at some specific time, inscribed those there.  They had no idea what was to come, what the future would hold, they were there just painting/scribing away.  They lived, they died.  TWO HUNDRED generations pass, no one will ever know who made this stuff, there name is eternally lost...but today, or yesterday, or whenever, you or I could go there and see this work they created all the way on the other side of history.  The painstaking work of a person who is forever lost to history, but that on some day in the distant fading past was there working away. 
This is the ceiling in the Temple of Hathor.


[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Ceiling_of_Temple_of_Hathor.JPG) is the image on wikipedia commons.  It didn't always look like this.  The ceiling of the Hathor Temple has recently been cleaned in a careful way that removed hundreds of years of black soot without harming the ancient paint underneath.  [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_Temple_complex#Ceiling_cleaning).
Pharaoh to subject: "You guys have too much time on your hands, go paint something."
We're pretty used to our modern view of ancient Egypt, all brown sandstone and granite, but in reality, it looked more [like Vegas.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0c/5c/6d/0c5c6d2d6b3ac58436774fa7bcd07557.jpg) And since a lot of buildings were painted white, a walk down Main Street might have been downright painful at noon.
at least it looks too high up for Chinese tourists to write on it
Aziz, light!
Needs more love than those endless cosplay posts
So what does it say?
Also eggs. Egyptians used egg-based paint. Its proteins make for real lasting power
It's not just the dry desert air, but being sheltered from wind and sand storms that preserves the paint.
Wow... that's a gorgeous image. Thank you!
I've been so confused looking for a 2,200 year old plant on the ceiling and pillars. Time to go home and close my eyes.
Fun fact: Many ancient Greek statues and structures were painted, but due to obvious climate reasons they were stripped of their paints. 
TIL ancient Egypt looks like it's wall papered with comic books 
I've watched a lot of "urban exploration" videos, and I can say with confidence that water is the ultimate and powerful destroyer. Humidity and especially water will wreak havoc on exposed architecture that isn't waterproof.
http://i.imgur.com/RdMWD9v.jpg
So much blue, how did they aquire that back then?
What is more impressive to me, is not the preservation by air, but that the land moved so little there to prevent the stone from cracking with a shifting building over the millennia. 
I never knew the lizard people were around in ancient Egypt already.
AZIZ LIGHT!
Too bad ISIS is going to blow it up.

For those mentioning that this post was stolen, the other post is actually a different picture of the same event. You can find the earlier post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4ni8yg/eagle_point_or_a_man_attempted_to_steal_a_bike/).
What's really cool is that a good roping horse is trained to not allow slack in the rope. So, if the thief tried to stand, or sit, and get the rope off, the horse just backs up to maintain a taught rope.  That's why the thief is holding onto the tree.

The horse is used to maintaining a taught rope on a cow. It was probably confused about how hard it was to maintain the right amount of tension.
His whole life was leading up to that moment.
Of course this happened in a Wal-Mart parking lot.
Bike thieves should be humiliated like this. This is fucking awesome. I wish I could have witnessed this in person.

If this was a video game, the tree would be a boss battle and as soon as you cross the root bridge, its roots would retract and trap you there till you beat him. Chances are beating him would unlock double jump so you can get back.

Is this in Michigan, my parents showed me a picture like this from there boat trip they took. I believe the area was called Picture Rock.

UP love! This is an hour from my hometown. Such an incredible place. There's 42 miles of scenery like this from Grand Marais to Munising. It's a popular sightseeing/hiking/camping destination. We hiked all 42 miles in 5 days a couple years ago. It was the trip of a lifetime and only cost us a few dollars.

Chapel Rock at Pictured Rocks in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Just booked a trip there for my buddy's bachelor party.

This seems like this was caused by erosion of the surrounding soil, leaving the the roots intact. Trees can't see where there is more soil, they can only move towards a light source. 
Shout out to the U.P. making it to the front page!  Yoopers unite!  
Is this by Pictured Rock in Michigan? Swear Ive hiked by that a dozen or so times. 
I've been here, northern MI UP right on Lake Superior right?
This is how I feel using my phone in bed while its plugged into the wall
That tree drinks the other tree's milkshake!
This is neat! I backpacked there last year. I, too, was amazed by this tree. It's called Chapel Rock because when it was discovered they said it was as beautiful as if it was formed on purpose and all it was missing was a bell to be like a famous chapel! http://imgur.com/u0Ynmpz
I'd say it's far more likely that there was once rock underneath the roots and then it eroded away, but the roots kept the shape.
This is from pictured rocks national park in the upper peninsula of Michigan, in case anyone was curious :)!
Tree roots stay where they have existed for years, despite erosion causing the ground they were once in to collapse into the lake.
Chapel Rock? Part of the Pictured Rocks National Lake Shore in the U.P of Michigan. Gorgeous place. Did a 50 mile hike through there the summer of 2014. 
If Jak & Daxter has taught me anything, it's that there is something at that tree.

I worked in a textbook store. ALL the time I heard this: "Okay so like I need a book and I don't remember what it's called or what it looks like or who wrote it or what class it's for or what my professor's name is but I need it by tomorrow."
We actually kept a computer in the back for customers to log in to their school accounts and figure out what the hell book they needed, but this probably would have saved a lot of time.
As someone who has worked at Barnes and Noble this is spot on.
Also, it was about this girl and she ran away from home and had adventures and at some point she had a milkshake. Also I think there was a horse. Or maybe it was a goat. 

Edit: NVM, it was *Twilight.*
I used to work at bookstore. My proudest moment was when someone came in looking for a book... they couldn't remember anything except that it was pink. I found it.
I worked as a librarian for a few years, and we got this kind of question quite often. 

"I forget the name, but it's yellow."

"Okay, let's go to the yellow book section then, shall we?"

They never seemed to appreciate that response. It was as if they felt I was mocking them or something.

Former bookstore employee, can confirm. Not sure what it's like now, but back then (20+ years ago... jeez I'm old) 90% of the time it was the book Oprah had talked about that day/week/month (I don't recall if she had her "book club" at the time or not, because I was a teenage male who did not own a television so 3 strikes against giving a shit about her show). 

If I recall correctly the "green cover book" was the Celestine Prophecy, the "outside party after dark" book was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Why do I recall these things... because I was asked the same question (more or less) a hundred times. 

This was before everyone had a cell phone, much less a smartphone, so there wasn't an easy way to "look it up" (this was when you still had to buy Netscape). I recall a particularly terrible manager of mine responding to my suggestion that we "make an Oprah's books" table to help people that I should instead "expand my knowledge beyond the classics and computer books by watching Oprah regularly." Just wow.

That's Blue Willow Bookshop in Houston, TX!! My family owns the place and since this went viral we've been getting some great attention via social media. Thanks for (re?)posting this. We would be ecstatic if you could add a caption or comment to this post mentioning our name and our website bluewillowbookshop.com!!
The Fault in Our Stars isn't  in there.
One time I was at a fairly large Indigo book store looking for a book I'd seen before online.  Of course I couldn't remember the name of it or the author, so I was just skimming through the section I thought it would be in.  A lady that worked there asked me if I needed help, and I was almost going to just tell her I was fine because I thought there's no way she can help me find this book.  But, i thought what the hell, let's give it a shot.  So i told what I remembered about the book, which was basically that it was 'kinda sciency' and 'had a red triangle on the front'.  She took a second to think about it, then "Oh yeah, it's over here"  and then she took me a couple rows over, reaches down to the bottom shelf and pulls out the book I was looking for.

Did she just know where every book was?

Was she magic?
Twist, all those covers are just dust jackets for other books
Oh hell no. This actually happened. Couldn't tell me the name, what it was about our who wrote it but they had seen their friend's copy and it was (kid you not) blue. 

45 minutes of talking about the types of books the friend liked and narrowing it down slowly I found the fucking book. 

They looked at it, said "oh, yeah. That's what it was called. Thanks" and walked out of the store without buying a damn thing. 

Fuck that person. If it's have had a weapon, I'd have gone to jail. 
As a former B&N employee I can concur. This happened way too often, or they would have oddly specific irrelevant information. "I'm looking for a book. It's got a tree on the cover and is 357 pages long." 

My other favorite thing was when they would just say "I'm looking for a book." I would then grab the nearest book to me, hand it to them, and walk off. 
Pretty sure this is a reference to an old Vasquez comic called "I Feel Sick"
Missing the Blue Man Group bio.
Forgot Catch-22
I worked as a merchandiser of CDs for many years (until ipods tanked our sales). I can't tell you how many people came up to me and said something like, "there's this song and it goes na na na something something girl" and I would have to try to figure what they were looking for. My best one was a guy that came in and said that he was looking for a CD that had some guys that sounded funny and sang about something but he couldn't remember what. It was UB40. 
Is this some sort of weird viral political thing with your silly name getting visibility?
Why aren't any of the people who work at bookstores and libraries talking about how frequently these kind of displays are put up? I know we've all had awful customers/patrons who expect us to divine which book they're looking for, but displays like this are really common, especially at libraries. I worked at one library that cycled through every color of the rainbow. It made for an eye-catching display and upped circulation.
But my book isn't blue
Fat Angie, that was the book.

I like this story too.  Guy plans to bury his million dollar Bentley for the afterlife and everyone goes crazy!  Then it turns out to be a big publicity stunt.

>Moments before lowering the car in the ground he revealed his genuine motive: To create awareness for organ donation.

>People condemn me because I wanted to bury a million dollar Bentley, in fact most people bury something a lot more valuable than my car, Scarpa said during a speech at the ceremony. They bury hearts, livers, lungs, eyes, kidneys. This is absurd. So many people waiting for a transplant and you will bury your healthy organs that will save so many lives.

I can't imagine what his mother is going through. But maybe there's some comfort in knowing he helped so many others, which would be a feat for anyone, let alone an 11-year-old. He was still a child, and it would have been absolutely understandable if he'd thought of himself first. 
Very powerful picture.
Signing up to be an organ donor is basically the easiest thing you can do to help save lives -- everyone should be an organ donor. This little boy is an example to us all.
holy shit, death being the catalyst of life. no better way to end one's journey than by allowing others to continue theirs. 
My sister passed away recently.  She was an organ donor, and everyone involved in that process was incredibly respectful, compassionate, and above all grateful for her decision.  She saved the lives of several people directly, provided organs for research, and tissues which could wind up helping 100s of people.  As bad as it all was, it's some small comfort knowing that her death wound up helping others.
[More information about this great human being in case anyone is interested.] (http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/11-year-old-chinese-boy-donates-organs-to-save-others.html)
I always thought you couldn't donate if you had cancer?
Relevant XKCD :

http://xkcd.com/659/
To see these people bowing to a boy donating his organs, is such a powerful image. I got chills all over my body. the respect they have is so immense.
Much respect to this young guy.
I find it amazing how something as simple as a few people arching their backs in your direction can mean more than a thousand words of thanks.  
It's like a primitive way of showing appreciation from before we were able to communicate with words.  
It's also great seeing such a positive piece about China. Seems to be in an almost permanent state of negativity these days.  
Respect.
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but here goes: 

My close friend took his life three months after he turned 22. Everyone was devastated and so caught off guard. He was so loved. Anyway, during his funeral I was so upset that I didn't think there was anything that could be said that could take away my grief. Well, I was wrong. He was an organ donor. They were able to use pretty much every single organ from the neck down and his eyes. The pastor of the funeral told us that because of his death, his eyes allowed a child to see for the first time. Whoever that kid was is so lucky, his eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue. Miss you, buddy.

 There's nothing that can take the pain away, but I hope for this child's family, the knowledge that he has given others a new chance will help. 
This will probably get buried but when I was in high school I had a friend who suffered brain damage after being hit by a car while he was crossing the street. He lived for the following three days before his death. He, too, was an organ donor, and the day after his death a story was reported of an anonymous 18 year old boy who had donated his liver to save a young girl. We all knew it was his. Following his death he donated any organ possible, from his heart to his kidneys to his corneas. He was a healthy young man whose death made an immediate and powerful impact on other people's lives. It's a sad but bittersweet story that I'll never forget. Most of the school followed through and became organ donors soon thereafter. RIP Robb. 
fuck...its too early to feel
Here's the whole story in Chinese with more photos, if you guys are interested in, I will try to give a brief translation

http://shaosanbai.blogchina.com/2196016.html

Edit: Very rough one, please forgive any typos and grammar mistakes

The boys name is **Yaoyi Liang**. He came to Shenzhen (close to Guangzhou) 2 years ago with his older brother and sister, who are seeking jobs in this metropolitan.

04/12/2014, his sister noticed Yaoyi was having slight movement disorder, and even fell out one time. Yaoyi was sent to hospital immediately next morning, the examination told that it was brain cancer. The family originally thought modern medical technology could save the little boy, however, after 2 surgeries on 04/16 and 05/08 respectively, things didn't get any better.

Yaoyi had been dreaming to become an astronautic scientist/engineer before he was diagnosed the illness. However he changed his mind, he hoped that if he could recover, he would try his best to be a doctor to help relieving the pain of others. During the period, he showed incredible maturity, never really complains the pain but tried to comfort his mother. 

When it came into June, Yaoyi himself seemed to realize it was coming to the end. He said to his mom: if I cant survive, please donate my body. The family came from rural area in China, his mom who was under-educated, cant really get what her boy was talking about. And then she realized. At the beginning, his sister was strongly against the idea, as per Chinese tradition, it is peaceful only when whole body is buried. After some time, the family understood, that was also another form of living in this world.

06/06, 11:45 AM, Guangzhou Zhongshan 1st Hospital, relatives of Yaoyi were called; 4:35 pm, Yaoyi peacefully passed away. 5:19pm, Yaoyis kidney and liver were collected, and would have transplant to others within 8 hours to save their lives. Yaoyi has become the 142th multi-organ donator in Shenzhen.

I wasn't aware that cancer patients could donate their organs. Are there not concerns about unknown metastasis, circulating tumour cells or circulating free DNA?

Edit: I read further into the thread and this is discussed, never mind! 
What was his name? This picture is amazing and this child deserves the dignity of his name being known 
Way to go kid. I'm very proud of you
Every day I come to Reddit for laughs and leave with tears. Reddit is the first ten minutes of Up in constant loop. 
My grandma received a heart from a young man who died when dove off a pier.  This was in the 90s and they told her she only had about 5 years to live with it and everyone else who did the program.  Thankfully she was given another 18 years.  This was enough to see me be born and grow up. Although she unfortunately passed away a year before I graduated high school, I am so glad I got to know her.  Without someone donating their organs that would have never happened.  Every year my grandma would have a second birthday on the young man that gave her the heart's birthday.  She would go to his grave and release a heart shaped balloon.  
Powerful. I wish it was higher resolution so I could frame it and hang it up at my uni accommodation. Pictures like this push me through med school.
An 11 year old makes the decision to save as many lives as he can, in the face of impending death. I can't get most full grown adults I know to make a reasonable decision if their life depended on it. This young... child, hero, saint... whatever you call him, had little knowledge and experience of many of the truly wonderful joys and experiences of life, yet was wise enough, and kind enough to ensure others to get a chance he never will. Its much too bad that with type of selflessness and concern for fellow man this child held, that he didn't get many more years to make the world a better place. We need more people like him.
I haven't felt this sensation of moisture coming out of my eyes in a while. It's not sadness, it's more a deep sense of respect and admiration. 
It's to early for crying, but that's not going to stop me.

From a previous post on Reddit:

>"I feel that I should mention that this is not a normal living area. These houses are called "Kolonihavehuse". They are small houses, about 30-40 m^2, with a garden. People who live in the city sometimes have these to have a little undisturbed garden somewhere. The houses usually have a living room, bathroom and a small kitchen. People do not actually live there, and people rarely sleep there."
No, it's not.

Went to Provence in 2002-

Visited a place named Pont du Gard. Stuck my toes in a stream in a valley that was traversed by a beautiful, two-tiered aqueduct/viaduct built a couple of thousand years ago.

I find that amazing, especially in light of the fact that steel reinforced concrete has a lfe expectancy of 50 to 100 years. 

The Roman concrete recipe contains fly ash, which imparts enviable strength and durability to the finished product.
I'd like to see this 1,800 years ago. New, clean, symmetrical, landscaped. So cool.
Better than every road in Michigan.

This is the kind of modern art I can get behind!
its better with Kinetic.
This is literally 3.5 blocks from where I live. It is at the Anchorage Museum in Alaska. I have never seen it look like this, but usually all the lights in the building are on. When I saw it last the projector was shining random symbols, letters, and numbers. It's pretty trippy to see it in person. It is just a string that spins all wibbly-wobby and as it passes in front of the light from the projector you see an image or color or whatever. I think it looks like bubbles when you stare long enough. 
Pretty sure that's an Aperture Science Excursion Funnel
where is this sculpture at?
Can anyone tell me what is happening here to create this?
This is some art I would actually enjoy looking at. None of this modern art BS.

And then you remember that there are stars out there that are so big that you could repost this with the title "visualization of how many of our suns that can fit in star Aldebaran
How many humans can fit on earth?
There's an odd twinge of existential dread I get looking at this.
I might have to crunch the numbers again, but I'd say that's about one metric fuckton of earths 
The sun is so large, a million earths could fit inside. And yet, it is only a middle-sized star.
That's at least a few I would think 
Then try to imagine how many of those would fit into a red giant. Hard to comprehend..
This should be demonstrated in schools( it's probably in books but no one reads them). It always amazes me how many people don't have an appreciation for the scale of the solar system. 
I prefer [Bill Nye the Science Guy's version](https://youtu.be/kuspgNU-pIU?t=1m19s)
This is not accurate unless there's a million+ balls in there. [Just googling this gives a simple yet amazing result.](https://www.google.lt/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how+many+earths+fit+in+the+sun)
This is false. I think the earths would collapse under pressure so there wouldn't be any air. Some math guy tell us REALLY how many earths could fit in the sun.
This is more like how many re-posts can be done on a single topic.
And in none of those OP will post original content
Why did you write Earth[s] like that? Your use of brackets is leaving me at a loss here.
This is the 25006897 repost of this in a month.
And to think if the small balls were stars and the big ball was our galaxy, we'd need far bigger ball.
Can someone do the math for the amount of space not occupied by earths?

Maybe I'll do it. Sorry, not good at formatting:

Volume of the sun: 1.41E18 km[3]
Volume of the earth: 1.08321E12 km[3]
Number of earths that fit inside the sun: 960000

1.41E18 - (960000*1.08321E12) = 3.7E17 km[3] or about 26% unoccupied space.
Came in here wanting some discussion about how interesting this is, then realized it's r/pics. Maybe someone will x-post it to /r/space... 
Looks like a package of Floam 
All I see is a deadmau5 head.
Or how many times this has been posted

There are in fact 3 white whales known to frequent the east coast migration route. Although i'm not sure if these have been 'confirmed' in a scientific sense, ie genetically/scientifically, they also bear the signs of albinism.

That one moldy potato in the bottom right though.
I'm very curious about the business. Are you willing to explain it a bit? Elsewhere in the thread I read your estimate of ~100,000 sacks / CWT in your storage. Assuming those are larger Russet Burbanks the current market spot price seems to be around 7.00 per 50lb (at first handler) so assuming similar prices you're walking about on maybe $1.3 to $1.4M in potatoes. I am guessing/assuming several things there however. Now there's a lot of expensive equipment in the business (not sure if you must lease or can rent as needed), you're paying for cooling costs for a few months, along with seeds, chemicals, probably some employee costs...and the land on which to do all this. How does the biz case work out, and over how long? Would you care to sketch out the biz case for us a bit more?
Is this your own private Idaho?

TIL peacocks can fly
X-Post from /r/MostBeautiful

Growing up near these birds I never thought twice about it.

However, I was surprised to find how many people didn't realize that these birds can fly.

[Here is a video of a peacock in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Gr_0cHlpM)

I've never seen them fly long distances however I have seen them fly to high trees (30+ feet tall).

I've never seen them directly fly to the top of a 30ft tree, usually they fly to the lower branches and I think they just work their way to the top.  

When I visited the Arcadia, CA arboretum, a worker said there is a peacock that can fly and perch itself up on one of its 60+ foot tall trees.

[Here's a very out of focus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaO1vhDyrk) but it does show some context of these birds flying out of pretty tall trees.
Peacocks are not graceful, my school had them all over the place and it would really be stretching it to call what they do flying.

They flap their wings like a motherfucker, making all kinds of racket, just to get up onto the roof and then when they decide to come down it's like the god damned Hindenburg.  You hear this loud flapping followed by them crashing down and it's all Oh, the humanity....."

Like a beautiful bull in a china shop.
Ah, the majestic disco turkey! Beautiful!

Thanks for sharing!
You gotta let me fly!
I don't think I've ever seen one in flight before. They're glorious.
Pretty sure that's a pokemon
Incidentally, it's terrifying to see this coming at you if you don't know what it is.  I used to work at a zoo, and we had free-roaming peacocks everywhere.  One leapt down from its roost and buzzed over the heads of a group of high school girls, doing it's whole "ee-AWWWW!" cry thing.  Those girls screamed and ran like hell was on their heels.  It was one of my favorite things I ever saw at that zoo, heh.
Such a  nice but rare picture considering they rarely bother to lift that feathery mass off the ground unless they are chasing a small child.

That look on his face is saying "Please don't shit myself, please don't eat me."
I don't know if this is the same animal, but when I was on safari in Kenya there was one cheetah that was known for using the hoods of jeeps as an observation post. The guides all called her "Queenie". We asked our guide what would happen if she ever jumped into a vehicle (the windows and roofs are all open most of the time), and he said that she did once, looked around and jumped back out again. Cheetahs are generally not interested in humans, since we're normally far too big for them to take down.

God damn hippies ruining the nuclear family of America! 
Man they've probably been through some shit together, and by shit I mean wild hippy orgys and swinger romps.
This is really nice. My parents and the 2 other couples that they went to Woodstock with are all still together. They are all still best friends as well. They have known each other since high school and still get together almost every other week. My mom speaks to the 2 other women on the phone probably every day. I have been on multiple family vacations with all of them from when I was very young through my late teens. I have been to all of their kids weddings and they were at mine. It's a nice story about a Bunch of kids from the Bronx that life turned out pretty nice for. 
The most beautiful thing is not only are they still together, they're still smiling.
Staying married to the same person for decades is harder than it looks.
I didn't even know the Woz was married 
LSD in the 60s and a lifetime of proper fucking will plant a permanent grin on your face. 
Great to hear. Thanks for that. :)

I'm so alone.

EDIT: To make this less of an awful comment, [here's a photo I took when I covered Eaux Claires last year](http://i.imgur.com/YDfpYAw.jpg). I love seeing moments like these...when two people are so intimate and comfortable with each other. I live vicariously through those glimpses of happiness.

EDIT EDIT: Here's [another one from the same festival](http://i.imgur.com/QeFQ612.jpg). I was shooting The National, and during their song 'I Need My Girl' this guy next to me turned around, got down on one knee, and proposed to his girlfriend. This is almost directly after (I let them have their moment obviously, she was sobbing!) and then I asked their permission to take it. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to ask their names, so I'm hoping someday someone recognizes them. I mean look at his face. That is happiness.
She was my elementary school nurse and I went to school with both their sons. They are really great people.  They had a cockatoo that was a fucking dick that would attack people though. 

Edit: bad grammar

Edit 2 : I hate these posts,  these are two really great people that have had successful careers and raised 2 great guy's.  
Dude's high as a kite
That's adorable
Super nice people who raised one of the nicest kids I ever taught.  Thanks for the update!
"Ha ha! We can't remember any of that concert!"

"We were so stoned!"

"Kids, right?"
Looks like the guy is only just coming down.

Seriously though, great story nice to see they are still together.
Yes, young sexy people: You too will be old and unsexy one day.
I keep thinking how dirty that blanket is. Driving me nuts
We should all be so happily married after so many years.

I'll ask the question that's in everyone's mind... How the heck do you manufacture something that small with that much precision?
For those who doin know how big a micrometre is, that "sphere" is about a little less than the width of a human hair. A human hair is about 90 micrometres
Does anyone know what the black object is?  A "cell"?
[No! Please! I have a family!](http://i.imgur.com/SdUX4hd.jpg)
When I was in sixth grade back in 1986 we learned about DNA and how defects can cause diseases. I asked if it was possible to change the DNA in a cell so that the body starts using and reproducing the DNA without the defect. The class laughed and asked me how could anyone fix individual cells. Those guys can suck it now!
Good Guy /u/Gilgamesh-, giving more pictures and context in the comments. 
I'm curious, does something this small operate on its own? Can it move and perform its functions without being physically moved by a human, or does it just sit there and we bring the cell (or egg) to it?

Edit for improper punctuation
What happens when you inject a cell with DNA?
That is amazing!
It blows my mind how we can create these tiny objects that actually work very accurately.
We've come a long way!
AH the ol Nanoinjector...my college nickname
A video about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djH8AM2diyE
Finally I can have nanomachines injected into me like Solid Snake! Where do I sign up? I want to be faster, stronger, smarter.
I was at Sandia National Laboratories on a "job shadow" like 13 years ago and they had machines that were as small as red blood cells that you could control with a joystick. 
Imagine what humanity can achieve if it were't for a few individuals who care more about money and personal gain over that of the collective humanity.
Cool. So how far away are we from nanobots that can repair our own cells and make us live a lot lot longer?? 
Is this an artists rendition of it, or is it an actual photo of one? Either way, that is amazing.
How in the world is something like this even made? 
What is this? A machine for ants?

Can you imagine how many showers these girls are taking a day?
To save the internet's search engines...

2200 Baht = 62.611 US Dollar
From California, would pay $60 for hour long shower without guilt.   Girl can hold the towel.

edit: Thank you, thank you, thank you for the golden shower!
I would *definitely* spend the extra 200 baht to get stimulated by breasts, thighs, stomach and feet. No brainier there. 
Sixty minutes?  Err, how much for six or seven minutes?
"shower for you"

Is she the one showering in front of you or will she be showering you?  

I would rather she shower first before her breasts, thighs, stomach and feet touch me.
So what if you are a girl? Will they finger blast you for the same price?
One night in Bangcok makes a hard man humble.
So, it's a nuru massage.
Wait your girlfriend doesn't want to have a spaghetti day

I feel like everyone just immediately typed "2200 baht to usd" in their search bar
What exactly is a girl shower?
Thats terrible, where exactly are these types of places so i can avoid them?
I would insist she left aswell.
I dunno, seems like a pretty good deal to me

High HIV prevalence among female sex workers in Bangkok
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512512
My parents own a restaurant near a state college here in California. Next to us is a Massage parlor owned by a middle aged Chinese woman. I always get people asking me if it's a shady place next door, and if the women there are pretty. I don't want to interfere with their business, so I just say I don't know. About the pretty girls, anyway, I didn't know if they did shady stuff. But the owner does get food from us often, so we have an okay relationship with her.

My mom and the Massage parlor owner were talking about their lease terms a few weeks ago and they were both complaining that business was bad and that we're all looking to sell our businesses and move elsewhere. My mom said bad business was partly due to being close to the college. The lady rants up with "I know! And college kids they're the worst! They never tip! And they always ask for handjob, I say no handjob!!!" It made me laugh but I guess now I know where she is with that business.

Spaceship!
Actual TIE fighter pilot 
TIL a lego man has done more with its existence than I have with my entire life.
So, according to [ULA](http://www.ulalaunch.com/), using a Atlas V, it is $27,063 per kg. With a Lego man weighing about 2 grams, that is a commercial shipping cost of **$54.13**.

(27063*0.002)
Best thing about space: You can't step on legos in microgravity.
Not sure if its just me but this is a total optical illusion.
Stare at the astronaut and if you're viewing this on a phone the slightly shake it.
It kinda looks weird to me. 
His visor is open!! X(
Source: https://twitter.com/Astro_Andreas/status/642304092350640129
I'm an idiot and my first thought was why is there a Lego man floating outside the station?
Can someone make this a wallpaper please?
What a time to be alive. 
What if there is a picture being taken of him, by an even bigger astronaut.
To think... some astronaut was going through his list of "must haves for space" and Lego Man was on that list.
How much does it cost to put one lego astronaut i n space?
This is Major LEGO to Ground Control!
More fun than Jenga out there, I guess..
What is this reddit sorcery? This picture seems like it moves slightly if you move your phone.
All I can think about is how someone is probably pooping about 5 feet away from this astronaut.

/u/mrpennywhistle 
As a toy photographer, this has to be the ultimate shot
THEY'LL CLOG THE INSTRUMENTS!!! 
The astronaut that the Lego guy is based off of was a PhD student of my professor.  The astronaut is the first astronaut from Denmark, and Legos are Danish.
I bet the chin strap portion of that Lego helmet is cracked.
Paid product placement from Danish company to Danish astronaut. Ka-Ching!
I've been on the fence about the whole "people in space" deal. But this picture confirms for me that this was all worth it.

Look how big this universe is and we're worrying about trans people in bathrooms.
Hubble Bubble
The mind-boggling thing is that this image that we're seeing was actually what the nebula looked like around the time humans were inventing the wheel and just started smelting copper.
I highly recommend [SpaceEngine](http://en.spaceengine.org/) as a tool for further exploring this.

I don't yet know how well the Bubble Nebula is depicted in SpaceEngine (but will tonight). However, flying out to it from Earth and panning around that region of the Milky Way, will give one a great sense of scale.
[This is what wikipedia has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7635#/media/File:BubbleM52HunterWilson.jpg) as an image (for now). Big difference. 

I also did not know that the "bubble" gets its glow from a very hot center star. 
If Hubble can take such breathtaking pictures you can only imagine what James Webb can show us
Is it possible to get 1920:1080 resolution?
Anyone else see the skull in that golden portion center image? 
That's amazing
Space is so cool. 
I'm surprised toil and trouble aren't included
There's coffee in that nebula!
They color in these photos if I'm not mistaken.
Hubble's doing Bubbles?

This would make it really obvious how infrequently I clean my tub. Deal breaker for me. 
This is great if you're in to filming bathtub sex.
All I can picture is how often I'd trip getting in and out of the shower.
Worst thing to have if you are drunk. Getting table topped by your own bathtub would be humiliating.
Man, I'd look like a hairy beluga whale at seaworld in that thing. Kids noses pressed up against the glass, me shrieking, "Don't look at me, I'm hideous..."

No thanks! Opaque tubs for me!

EDIT: Out of curiosity. When down-voting a statement like this, are you actually saying, "No man, you'd look great in that tub"? Or, is it because I've allowed children into my hypothetical bath scenario? Cuz, I'm hypothetically wearing my tiger print, banana hammock speedos you know...
Three words:

Hard

Water

Stains
But you can see naked people if they are in the bathtub. 
This would make for a graphic water birth.
Hopefully they don't produce a corresponding toilet. 
pornhub? - more like porntub, am I right? :D

Seriously though - this tub will probably be used for porn.
As if having a white bathtub is hard enough to keep clean...
I want to fart in this.

This looks like the most uncomfortable bathtub ever made. How are you supposed to lie down in that thing?
Sooo..... Any rule 34 on this?
Transparent aluminum!
It would take too long to fill up D:
Looks pretty now, but wait until its full of sweaty ass bathwater and funk
i'd really hate to slip and have that edge catch my neck. >_<
... filled with cold water.

Now fill it with hot water and see it fog up instantly.
3D render, just sayin.
The bubbles are futile. 
This would have to be in Norway where there water is Voss water, so there for you would never have to worry about the hard water and all :) but unfortunately I live in the USA also, but would be bad ass
As cool as it looks, i know i would scrape the crap out of my knees or constantly hit it with some part of my body... :/

Beautiful picture.  I love the depth of field present with the background.  You can tell that the lens quality was excellent back then.  You also did a terrific job with the colorization.
Hah! Nice try. Using time travel is cheating
How does colourising work? I'm confused as hell how you manage to get the colours.
Colorization helps me pretend this wasn't 80 years ago and the kittens aren't dead... 
At first glance it looked like she was hanging kittens by their skin.  Best double take I've made today.
Okay. Nobody asked, so I will. Any idea why she's putting them into socks and essentially hanging them out to dry?

Incredible job, OP! I love that the film aesthetic is still intact. 
How did you manage to get her skin such a good color? I always have a hard time compensating for the gray hue underneath and it never turns out this good. Could you give any pointers?
This looks like it could have been taken yesterday. The windows look like uPVC and the house looks like your average British house.

Having dated a nurse, his stare is accurate. I respect the profession whole-heartedly, but he has experienced life outside of college and nursing. They're about to clog his facebook newsfeed with someecards about night shifts and the emergency department.

"No, just flashbacks of today when Tina said something about Tammy to Casey who incidentally is best friends with Stacy in which and get this, Tammy and her are cousins."

I was a US Army Combat Medic, now I'm a nurse. Nursing is the perfect infantry scam.. "oh you have to wipe butts all day..." or "why are you doing women's work?" No brothers, the scam is this; we get paid a shit ton of money, have job security, get to wear pajamas all day and are surrounded by women.

Those are some smoking hot nurses. He did right I would say. 
Nurse who happens to be male here. In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options. Often you're immediately emasculated. Females look at you as a man doing a historically woman's job which makes them wonder why you're there to begin with. Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience. Now working as a traveller and agency RN, i sometimes work in multiple hospitals a week with all new faces and people to get to know which makes you all the more intriguing to the staffers if you don't suck. 
I am a female RN but my youngest brother is an LPN. He says his nursing school experience was just terrible and working with 99.9% women is less than ideal for him.
I'm a male and I've been an RN for about 7 months now.  Out of taking care of hundreds of patients.. only one has had a problem with a male taking care of them.  All the others had nothing but positive things to say about males being in nursing.  When I starting nursing school I used to be afraid to tell people my major due to the negative stigma.  That stigma does not exist and I am now proud to tell people I am a nurse.  Patients, doctors, and other nurses all treat me with the utmost respect.  I am not a male nurse. I am a NURSE!

I think the jury is still out on how Kim Jong Un will rule.  He ended up in charge much earlier than expected.  He's currently consolidating his power internally while taking baby steps to open up the country.  He was educated in western europe and is much less doctrinaire than his father or grandfather.

In the long run I think (hope) that he will reform the steaming pile that was tossed in his lap.  This is the best opportunity that N. Korea has had in a very long time.
There were no survivors.

North Korea is one of the craziest fucking places on the planet. If you didn't know this place actually existed and people explained the situation to you - you would assume they are lying.

"...cheese.  you know, it's a food that's full of protein and nutrients."

"fuck it.  just try not to cry."
people really griefed over his father's death. the majority of the population probably actually believes the propaganda. so i'd rather think that those are tears of joy of having met the dear leader in person.
When history looks back on North Korea it will be revealed as an historic genocide, and scholars will debate where the rest of the world was.

Unfortunately, us joking about it will be part of that record.
They're distressed because he just ate one of the children.
Look at all them women in pants.


WHORES.
My thoughts are that because wearing pants for women just became legal, all of these women, who were obviously coerced into taking the photo, are scared shitless that for some reason wearing pants in this photo could mean their deaths
Maybe he brought them Pizza!
It really hits you when you realize the only fat people are the ones working for the government.

Amazing place, in The Spiti Valley right by the Himalayan border with Tibet. The monks there say this is where the current Dali Lama wants to 'retire' to. 
Get there by: Flying to New Delhi, get the train to Shimla, hire a 4x4 and driver and set off (with permits) for an amazing 2/3 day drive.

As a white American, I am amazed by this. My only exposure here is movies like Slum Dog, showing India as a place with Rich and Poor, extremely hot and crowded. Or, Indiana Jones style imagery, also highlighting the crowded poor areas. 

It's absolutely amazing to me to have Reddit open my mind, free me of the ignorance I have due to Hollywood, and now I have something to go and TIL about.
Looks like the monasteries in the center mountain region of just cause 2. Or maybe they look like this monastery, I don't know.

I've been there! This is in Ladakh in northwest India, and is in the outer Himalayan ranges. Ladakh was part of historical Tibet, and so the culture up there (while uniquely Ladakhi) is more Tibetan than Indian. It is also a part of Kashmir, though (or really, abuts it), so it's a mix of cultures. I think the average altitude of Ladakh is somewhere around 14,000 feet.

I've been here. Beautiful place. It's even more pleasing in summers when you can see the river meander by from the top.

Had chai and a bit of gossip with the monks there. 


You can reach India's highest inhabited village Kibber down the road and it's feels like the end of the world. A small self pulled cable car quarter the size of a mini takes you to the sister village of it across a deep gorge.


Also, occasional Golden Eagles fly past the top of the monastery. One of the most beautiful places you can visit.

For a small donation, kids can pump some oil directly into the tank!
All jokes aside, New Orleans' aquarium is by far one of the best of I have ever seen.  
Not that I don't agree with the sentiment expressed here, but it is true that the petrochemical industry is one of the largest sectors of our (Louisiana's) economy, so any big museum, park, etc. will usually have large donations from those companies.
That's some slick marketing skills. 
The Whitest Kids U' Know said it best:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE7KcF3MphU

United Petroleum Rep: "You know they say that Oil and water don't mix"

United Petroleum Scientist: "But dammit if we're not trying"


Reminds me of the [insectarium](http://imgur.com/5NqIXkg) at the St. Louis Zoo.
[Google's street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.9507235,-90.0632551,3a,37.5y,87.62h,71.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swAEkZd2KUbI-LF6AgfavxA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)
By far my favorite moment from visiting the New Orleans aquarium was pranking a little kid.

There was a concave viewing window in the big tank, but head on, you could tell.  There was a little girl sitting head-on but a bit far away.  It seemed she didn't notice that she could poke her head into the concavity to look around.

I went up to the window and said, "Hey, watch this," and placed my hand, mime-style, on where she seemed to think the glass was.  And then *pushed.*

"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"  And she ran off.

I later saw her frantically pointing at me to who I assumed was her mom as I was leaving.
I love how that whole take is supposed to show how those oil rigs provide a great undersea ecosystem.  Fish love Big Oil!
They gave us the aquarium so that we dont have to worry about the real ocean anymore. 
It's also of note that the tank's design and layout are intended to simulate the bottom of an oil rig, so their sponsorship (while certainly eyebrow-raising) DOES sort of make sense.

As a New Orleanian, I know they have the money. I don't like it, but I know it. And I'd rather the kids see it, while the adults roll their eyes at the irony.
I thought the same thing when I went there for the first time. 

I always imagined that one day they would put on a kids presentation, showing that there is no way that oil can harm sea life, because water and oil separates. There for, the fist are fine. Or some other BS like that. 
I was working offshore on a Shell platform when they accidentally pumped 80bbls of Biocide into the Gulf.... "Oops! My bad...." 
Reported? = Nope
"We're sorry..."
The lone survivors.
Look at all the fish we kill!
they spelled "destroyed" wrong 
I fucking HATED this when I went to NOLA Aquarium.  The entire exhibit is about how the oil rigs provide substrate for coral to grow and create habitat for fish and other marine life.  Yeah I get it that there are fish near oil rigs but not a fucking WORD about the oil spill or cleanup or anything.  Twisted.
"Nature - sponsored by corporations" 
[deleted]
Y'all laugh, but after the oil spill we had a big problem with people marking the BP sign. People would use anything red to cross out that sign: crayons, pencils, markers, sharpies, and most commonly lipstick. After it was all said and done and everything cooled down, AAOA had to buy a new sign. Someone usually stayed by the sign on busier days.

The whole Gulf of Mexico exhibit is geared towards promoting oil companies because to some extent, they actually do help. The right side of the exhibit shows a barren seabed. A few scattered rocks provide minimal cover for small fish, so normally you only see medium to large fish and sharks. On the left side, there's a quarter scale model of an oil rig, which provides hiding spaces for smaller fish which in turn attract even more medium and larger fish. In recent years, reef balls and pipes have been added to show other ways of promoting smaller fish to move in.

Oil rigs, when properly maintained, benefit everyone with perks that are not just about oil. Although making sure you don't spill tons upon tons of oil into the ocean really helps.

Edit: Look, I'm stating this as what they teach their volunteers and how it's presented. This is what they taught me for the years and thousands upon thousands of hours that I worked there and this is the image that AAOA wants to present to the public.

And if you think for one second that I feel that the Horizon disaster was an afterthought, then you have another thing coming. I watched those struggling pelicans with the same sense of hopelessness as I did upon "the grand pre-open tour" after Katrina when we basically had nothing alive save for a few animals who could breath air and a couple very stubborn fish. Having gone through nearly a complete aquarium's worth of animals in 2005, if you were there working and if your house had been damaged, you had to develop a very dry sense of humor.

Edit edit: OK, I get it. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was very bad. Y'all act like this didn't effect me, my family, my friends, my workplace, or anything. Please, stop PM'ing me nasty things. Y'all are worse than the lady who thought that penguins were fish and that I couldn't be possibly be right in saying that they were bird and followed me around the rest of the afternoon trying to have a debate to defend her penguin-fish platform.
Reminds me of the song Big Yellow Taxi:

*They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum*

*And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them*

*No, no, no*

*Don't it always seem to go*

*That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone*

*They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot*

And that, is, irony!
If only we could fit the entire gulf in a tank, just think about all the extra oil we could drill out there in the new desert.
Remember when it was sponsored by itself and doing just fine?

Now if the bear went for the Cat's food then there would be a storm of hissing and claws from the cat
Get a lot of bears strolling through your yard ?   Cat knew even if she couldn't see it.  Smell, ground vibrations...she just didn't give a shit. 
It's a black bear, they're pussies compared to grizzlies. 
Thanks for using "couldn't care less" instead of "could care less".
what happened to the cat?
A cat in the yard? My bear couldn't care less
That's one tough pussy, not afraid of anything no matter how big it is.
This actually isn't too surprising to me. I live in VT, and I've heard a few stories of bears being CHASED OFF by house cats. A man down my road a bit had his dog mauled by a bear, and when he opened his door to yell at the bear to scare it off, his cat ran out at the beast. Well, that bear turned and ran off like the littlest of bitches.
Is your cat Jay Cutler?
Bears are the most overpowered animal ever. Seriously. They eat fish and berries and shit, why do they need to be able to punch my face off?

I dont know if the bear even knows the cat is there. It's about the same color as the tiles, and bears have shitty eyesight anyways. It's being perfectly silent and not moving. I guess it smells like a cat, but that whole yard probably does. 
oh my gosh! You used the expression "Couldn't care less" correctly!
Bears are probably the only North American animals I would not want to meet face to face, but it seems like 90% of the time they'll bail out of it you yell at them if they're in your yard... I think it's when you're in *their* yard that you have to worry...

Who wants a tutorial?

Edit: I'll make a tutorial tomorrow, sorry but it's not a straight forward filter like you're hoping (I was too!). Some people have asked if you just fold the image, that's certainly possible but as you've all seen it creates major artefacts, due to the warping. It's a great place to start though as it helps to establish what you should be aiming for. Those of you familiar with Photoshop this technique is essentially a matte painting especially with more complicated images. 

Basically you don't bend the image, you duplicate, rotate as necessary and then mask the connecting line with any techniques you can. Such as using the clone tool or selecting objects and spreading them across the connecting line to conceal the stitch. Oceans and beaches work well because our eyes are expecting to see repeated patterns which can hide the appearance of repeated sections. 

I'm pretty sure you chaps who are familiar with photoshop will get the idea. 
I think it does look better than the original because of that slant on the left. And the contrast between the land and the sea makes it even better. Amazing job! 
This one looks better! Good job!

My dad had polio when he was a kid. He was one of the last kids to get it before the vaccine came into use in the US. He spent a summer in one of these. 

As a result, he is very much in favor of vaccines. 
[but check out this crackin Iron Lung Party](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Iron_Lung_ward-Rancho_Los_Amigos_Hospital.gif)
vaccinate so we don't have to use our bbq smoker as a lung..
I remember as a kid being terrified I might end up in an iron lung. Then my parents took us to the local grade school to get our polio vaccine, it was squirted onto a sugar cube. The whole town turned out. I remember the long lines of people. My memory is that we did this twice, perhaps? 

And my smallpox vaccination, still have the scar from that. 
[Vaccines made the iron butt obsolete.](http://i.makeagif.com/media/10-28-2014/ZLHQK1.gif)
Remember when you got polio? Me neither because vaccinating is great
I struggle to  understand why my kid can not bring peanut butter crackers to school, but other kids can bring measles.

My great-aunt got polio when she was pregnant with her second of four children. She was a bad-ass but she was never able to move around again with a wheelchair or her "sticks." 

Her older sister, another great-aunt, died of diphtheria at age six.

This is only a stone's throw away in history. VACCINATE.

P.S. If you want to learn more about what life was like for polio survivors, there's a wonderful memoir by Peg Kehret called Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio. I read it aloud to my son and we both thought it was terrifically interesting.
# #BringBackIronLung
You're killing your father, Larry!
Am I the only one that wants to turn that in to a bed, like a cocoon bed with wrap around memory foam with cooling gel beads.  
Actually modern ventilators and endotracheal intubation made this obsolete because we still need to ventilate people. Still get vaccinated though. 
Makes me think of radiohead. 
I work in public health and I still can't believe this is an issue. Parents come in explaining how they aren't gonna put that "poison" in their kids. That they're going to just boost the immune system through diet. Measles doesn't care how many vegetables you eat asshole!
Is it just me or is anyone else thinking that with a bit of modification that iron lung would be great for smoking a few briskets? Damn, I reckon you could get a whole hog on there.
#***AND A GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR***
The "vaccines cause autism" thing is so messed up. Even if vaccines did cause autism you're admitting you'd rather have your child be dead than autistic. 
And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker!
My grandmother had polio as a child and only grew to be 4 ft. 9 inches. It basically crippled her. What a crazy world we live in where people refuse vaccines. 
So we take away an important part of industry and make many iron lung manufacturers unemployed
Jackson Hole? If yes, the staff there are fantastic!

Cool story, Brian. 
Were you guys having a competition to see who could look the most uninterested?
Nice Sum 41 and Offspring posters, Brian
Brian actually came to my rescue when my dorm was playing "Nerf Mafia" later that year. Some guys had me trapped inside the engineering building (the game was only played outdoors), so I let Brian borrow my shirt and beanie. He ran out the front door and drew their fire. He continued running across campus and everyone who had been staking me out ran after him.  
&nbsp;  
I waited two minutes and then walked quietly back to my dorm.
I was in a dorm where there was a girl who looked just like me, dressed like me, and even had the same major. 

She even walked and talked like me. It was rather unreal. Our names sounded similar, just one letter off, so people would call out to her and I'd respond, and vice versa.

My mother was visiting me once and I went to take a shower. At around the same time, my doppelganger got done with hers and began walking to her room. My mother saw what she thought was me going somewhere not my room and called out to me and she answered. I came out to see both of them talking and my first reaction was 'mom, that's not me!'

We've stayed in touch and she's now a researcher in the same area as I am. When I was quitting my earlier job, I referred her to that team and she got hired. My old colleagues say it's like I never left.

Edit: I saw her parents at graduation. They look nothing like mine, though the resemblance to her is clear. I'm also the spitting image of my mom except for my father's jawline, so I'm not adopted either. That made it genuinely cool for me.
I read "10 years ago I went off to college" and thought, man, you must be old.

Then I realized that I started college 11 years ago. 

:l
I am a neuroscientist. In biology/medicine, we use [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to find articles, and authors are listed as "LastName, FirstInitial SecondInitial". I'm listed as Thompson CK. And since Thompson is such a common name, I'm not the only Thompson CK. In fact, there is another Thompson CK publishing in neuroscience, and occasionally I get emails for him, because his name is Christopher K Thompson, my exact name. 

Every year, there is one big neuroscience conference with 35,000+ attendees, and last year I emailed him to see if we can meet up. He comes to my poster, and I am just shocked at how similar her looks to me! I have two brothers, and he looks a lot more like me than either of them! Even more, he also happened to grow up in a town about 8 miles from my hometown. We both have degrees from the University of Illinois. We both really like pizza and beer. I mean, what are the chances...

Here is a [pic.](http://i.imgur.com/yoLulp0.jpg) I'm on the left. Funny enough, I had shaved my beard about 3 months prior to this pic being taken. If I'd left it on, we'd almost be twins.

Same thing happened to me. I was living in Barcelona and I was hanging out at a very popular youth hostel and I kept meeting people who would say "Yeah, we've met, your Sean."

And I never forget faces. Eventually I was like "No, I never met you!"

And the response was "Yeah, we met earlier, you are Sean from Baltimore". And I was from Baltimore.

Turns out, there was another Sean from Baltimore staying at the hostel and meeting loads of people. 

Yeah, and he looked *exactly* like me. When we ran into each other in the hallway I instantly knew this was the dude. He looked at me the exact same way since he had been dealing with the same issue since we were both very outgoing people.

We talked for about 3 seconds and then both ran in different directions. I guess we were both freaked the fuck out that we were both Sean from Baltimore, short hair, same facial structure, same clothing style, same height, same build, same social personality...

This is the bottom of a fucking frying pan isn't it. 
This is amazing. Pluto has always been this sort of dark blue planet in my mind for my entire life.
That's a jawbreaker

Pluto WAS a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagree back. 
Information about this image [according to NASA](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19952):

> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).

> The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

You heard about Pluto? It's messed up, right?
wow. that "desert" looking area doesn't have impact craters... does that mean that there is sufficient sediment transport (wind?) on the Pluto to cover up those impacts??? simply fascinating. 
Pretty amazing when you compare it to the images produced by the Hubble Space Telescope: http://goo.gl/qBWf0s

Aha! Bruges. I knew I remembered that tower from somewhere. 

**Ken**: [*preparing to climb*] Coming up?  
**Ray**: What's up there?  
**Ken**: The view.  
**Ray**: The view of what? The view of   down here? I can see that from down here.  
**Ken**: Ray, you are about the worst tourist in the whole world.  
**Ray**: Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me but I didn't, so it doesn't.
I want that experience with every inch of my body.  
How do the waffles taste with home-field advantage?
Belgian here. The sugared waffle and strawberry combo you'll be able to find at pretty much every local market. Most will have a waffle stand.

Places to see when visiting:

* Ypres and the entirety of the 'Westhoek' especially nowadays with the 100 year anniversary of WW1. There are plenty of memorial sites here so you might even find a family member. Well preserved remnants of trenches, and some very nice museums.

* While you're in this area the coast isn't too long of a drive. It's a huge tourist trap but if you want try Belgian mussels then you'll find the best on the coast. All sorts of freshly caught fish and seafood can be bought on the dike at around 4-5 pm in the afternoon, when the boats come back in.

* Some of our cities have a very rich history. Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp for example were economical powerhouses in the medieval times and you still get to visit old guild houses and the like. Tongeren on the other hand is the oldest Belgian city and dates back to Roman times. Tongeren has a nice Gallo-Roman museum that sheds light on both cultures living together and merging within Belgian borders.

Local cuisine to try out. Most of it has a very countryside and homely feel to it.

* 'French' fries. Really, these things are Belgian and every town will have at least a few 'frietkoten', places that specialize in only selling French fries and other deep-fried stuff that goes with it. I recommend asking the locals for a good place. It's tough to find a place that sucks but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference in quality.

* Chocolate. If you find a chocolate shop you should definitely go and buy some real Belgian pralines. High price, but worth experiencing.

* Mussels. Best place to order this is obviously the coast, so you're guaranteed they're as fresh as can be. Most often served with fries, a bit of mayonnaise, and a special sauce just for the mussels. The mussels are basically cooked in a stewy vegetable soup with lots of spices. Shrimp are also a very loved local seafood.

* Beef carbonnade, locally known as 'stoofvlees'. I personally dislike it but most Belgians freaking love it. The sauce is often prepared with some heavy beer like a Trappiste or Tripel.

* On that note, the beer. There's a huge variety here. Some people love Jupiler, others the heavier Duvel. We have all sorts of white, blonde, and dark beers as well as fruity 'chick' beers. I'm not much of a beer guy myself but I fucking love a cold Stella Artois. Some places especially in the city will specialize in serving as many different beers as possible and they'll even serve them in the correct glass. Worth asking around if there's such a place where you're visiting. You can drink an afternoon away just exploring tastes if you're not careful.

* Other stuff I can't be bothered to describe anymore: *waterzooi, paling in't groen, pensen, ...*

* My personal favourite: *kiekerenbloed*, literally chicken's blood, which is exactly the main ingredient. It's a *very* local dish that's made by (as far as I know) mixing chicken's blood with bacon grease and baking it, then serving it with a sandwich and a dollop of mustard. [Some gentlemen enjoying a pint and a plate of kiekerenbloed.](http://i.imgur.com/ZO3UeHm.jpg)
Fucking Bruges.
Someday I'd like to retire to Belgium and live entirely on waffles and fries.

It'd be a short rest of my life, but it'd be worth it.
Brugge?
I fucking love Brugge. 
> What are they doing over there? They're filming something. They're filming midgets!
Yes... But have you seen the [alcoves?](http://youtu.be/zQXlW0GzlD4)
I'll be in Brugge in about 3 weeks. Any tips?

Edit: Great tips, everyone. Thanks!
this would be more a real Belgian breakfast

http://i.imgur.com/yHmtkEp.jpg

specially since Brugge became champion in football
No joke, I ate at this same place in Bruge, same table yesterday. 
I knew my user name would come in handy one day. 
Nice to see a picture of what Belgium is really like instead of the dangerous war zone the media has been portraying it as recently. 
I had a muffin from Costco this morning with coffee that got cold because I had to hold my newborn while my wife ate her muffin. BEAT THAT ASSHOLE
Since youre in Belgium, I take it that would be just a waffle then, eh??
That's nothing but sugar. And caffeine from the espresso. I prefer the German way of meats and cheeses, need that morning protein.
And here we see a nice neighborhood within the walls of Isengard.
Something about it reminds me of the one scene in Inception.
*sigh* Europe is so beautiful.

Would make a nice oil painting
I had the same view and the same breakfast some years ago.  
Thank you for sharing this picture which reminded me of simpler times. 
I would move to Belgium in a Minute, if I could stay there for the rest of my life, I love the whole country and everything in it.

This is great example of landscape agate, which is [chalcedony](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chalcedony) with a number of different mineral impurities making the stone resemble landscapes.  Here are a few more:

It's like Mount Rushmore if Mount Rushmore was a tribute to the Thing as imagined by Picasso.

I seem to remember learning in one of my conflict resolution classes about the history of the mountain and the original people's who lived by it revered the mountain as sacred. Carving it up and putting president's faces was the ultimate insult. I'm no expert on the matter though. Anyone else here know more?
It feels like you can sort of see the faces in the stone
I love that we have such a thing but when I think about it, it's kind of something you'd expect to find in North Korea.  A larger than life monument carved in a mountain of Kim Jong Il and Un.
Count Rushmore sure did a great job. 
Should have left it as is.

I wasn't drunk, but a couple of weeks ago I sent a congratulations card to the new owner of my childhood home. My Mum and Dad moved out at the beginning of November. They bought the house and lived there since 1967 or '68. It's going to feel weird on my visit home this summer.
Ahh Sam Adams Brewery. They let you mail a postcard for free. I mailed one to myself because it was the only address I knew. Mine read:

Hey. I'm drunk in Boston!

Don't forget to pay student loans next Monday. 

Yours truly,

"Marge, this may be the beer talking, but you got a butt that won't quit. They got these pretzels here... hgfhtrdhfgdFIVE DOLLARS getouttahere..."
This makes me want to send mail to all of my old addresses
*P.S.: Have you found the safe already?*
Whenever my friends travel, i tell them to find a local stranger to write me postcards.  Then I'd forget about it.  By the time I receive it in the mail, its always a fun little surprise.
I feel like this and the starbucks bears are viral ads.
Holy crap, I used to sort those postcards. 

I temp'd at the Boston Beer Company's headquarters in Southie when I lived there for a few years, and this would have been in October of 2014. As the front receptionist, it was my job to sort through those postcards that came from the brewery and make sure nothing vulgar got through. Probably so that the many, many fantastical drawings of penises didn't wind up on places like Reddit and get associated with Sam Adams brand... 

I used to put stickers on dirty messages and still send them through because it made me laugh. Occasionally I even added a note of my own to the postcard if it was really funny. It was a really annoying part of the job because they come in huge bags, but it was also pretty fun because of hilarious messages like this one. 

You'd be surprised how much this occurs. 
Thanks, dad.

Please come home.

And start going to AA again.
This is actually ridiculously sweet.  I'd send them a message back saying the same. :) 
This is way too Boston
The only addresses I know are my current address and P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney
I once made the mistake of letting a man into my house who had said he'd grown up there. Once he got in things got weirder until I nearly called the cops because he ended up wanting to pull back the wallpaper in "his" bedroom to see where he had written his girlfriend's name inside a heart on the wall.
Inside is going to be pictures of all the orgies that took place in that house. Yay holidays!
What's Reddit's general consensus on /r/pics that's just photo of some text written by OP and a story that is hard to verify?
Hey, those are my initials. Did... did I get drunk and write someone a postcard?
Being drunk in Boston only writes off 2 people in all of Boston
p.s.: Why did you paint the walls? Why did you clean the floor? Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?
I was at a party once and these two guys were just kinda doing your basic small talk. One mentions his hometown, other guy used to live in that hometown. Turns out the guy he was talking to was from the family his parents sold their old house to! They became really good friends after that too, it was one of the funnier bromances I've ever seen.
The lady who grew up in the house I now own is creepily attached to it, and often emails me to subtly reprimand me for any changes I've made to the house (apparently she drives past it frequently).

She also stops by to visit at least once a year, and tried to get me to agree to swap houses with her for a weekend.

My husband doesn't think this is weird at all.
I had to make a comment, because this had 666 comments and I just couldn't leave it like that.

Hahahha holy shit if you live in Cambridge, that could be me. Definitely don't remember doing that but glad to see it.

Yeah I was manager at one of the closing Wet Seal stores. They lied to all of us through the holiday season, saying that we were low on stock because they were remerchandising for spring. 

Friday there was a conference call where they told my entire district that they were closing us down. Our DM has over ten years with this company and they basically shit on her, she was crying on the call and it made me want to punch something.  They made me fire my sales associates on Saturday.  Not a lick of notice for anyone. 

Wet Seal is a bunch of lying-ass scumsuckers and I hope they all rot for what they've done to us.
I will continue to not shop at wet seal
My wife had worked at our local Wet Seal for almost 10 years working her way up to SM (Store Manager) around October 2013. By March 2014, her Co-manager (basically number 2 in charge) was fired, and the assistant (number 3 in charge) quit for a better job. She worked until June without a day off. Couldn't use vacation, and the company was super slack at hiring new managers. She quit in June when she found out the district director wasn't interviewing the people she found to replace the people she was missing and wasn't doing anything to help her. Fuck Wet Seal.

I love the Internet because 20 years ago companies could do shit like this without any consequences. Today, there's at least a chance the company will have to address this in order to avoid the negative publicity and backlash if the story gets out 
long term employee's without raises is extremely common unfortunately. I still work part time in retail, but only because I have been there since before a pay freeze. A lot of very hard workers trying to get by for $8 an hour

Looking at yahoo finance, their stock price has been below $1 since September, meaning they will be delisted from the NASDAQ soon. Heading for a bankruptcy very soon.  
[Fly you fools](http://i.imgur.com/zCZLR1n.jpg)
I work in one of the Wet Seal stores this is happening in and it's awful! Our sick time is not "given" to use, we have to accrue it like vacation days. My staff was given 24 hours notice before their last shift and my assistants and myself are having to work in the store by ourselves so corporate can avoid paying out extra money to associates. I also have an associate in my store who has been with me for over a month, her pay card was not activated by corporate and when we called about it we find out the lady in charge of that department had taken a vacation and literally tons of other girls were not receiving money on their pay cards either. This whole situation is crappy for all people on the bottom of the totem pole and I'm honestly just glad to be done with this company. 
Same story here in [North Carolina](http://imgur.com/j8b4jHn).  I know a store manager over there who has been told nothing but lies over the last month when questioning why their store wasn't receiving new inventory.  Classy company.  
That's pretty fucked up. Not getting paid for your sick leave is par for the course... Most retail employees don't even get paid sick days. A $95,000 raise for the CEO is legitimately undetectable in terms of corporate cash flow. That being said, giving your employees one day to find a new job is absolutely awful. My girlfriend was a manager at Borders, the book store, when before they went bankrupt. The employees were strung along for quite some time, but eventually they came clean and said "we're closing in 3 weeks, liquidate everything". Most of the employees stayed during that time because it was pretty much the easiest retail job they could ever have for 3 weeks. "What're they gonna do, fire me?"
My partner works for H&M. He's a 5 year employee. He now has 5 weeks vacation, 14 days 'personal' time and healthcare for both of us (domestic partner insurance) that costs less that $50/month with a tiny deductible. I've worked for Apple, Samsung and Canon. I've never had benefits as good as he gets. 

Just chiming in to say retailers can do right by their people. 
as a stocky 30 year old male, I will be sure to never shop there again.
From someone who is ignorant, why are so many Wet Seal stores closing?

Good for them. I have no idea what Wet Seal is but good for them. 
A month with no check, commendation to the person who didn't burn that building to the ground.
Shitty ass corporations man. I worked at a pizza hut a few years back and they told us the store was going to eventually close, but never gave us a date. So I stroll into work one day and find the store locked, and closed signs all over it. Not even a call. Good riddance. 

I hope those poor employees find something else. A place where they aren't so much screwed over. 
They are lucky all the employees did is make a sign, and not just take turns shitting on the floor before walking out

There's a legend among Jeep enthusiasts that there may be dozens of these boxes sitting on the ocean floor, either from a sunken ship or crates deemed unnecessary that were thrown overboard to reduce weight on the ships after returning from the war. And of course the legend has it that the crates are waterproof. 
Fun fact: Jeep Wrangler windshields can still be folded down, for no real reason other than to carry on the tradition from when they needed to be stackable like this.

Sample text from page 1, see page 2 fire some more cool pictures:

> Jeeps were produced and packed this way for shipment to U.S. forces and countries like England and the Soviet Union who the U.S. supplied during WW II. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Richmond, CA, about 70% of production was boxed due to their close proximity to the San Francisco port.

> Boxing up a jeep was expensive and time consuming so it was only done when absolutely necessary. Jeeps that were crated were complete vehicles, not a box of parts  windshields were folded, wheels taken off and a few other things done to minimize the cubeage. Very few, if any, of these crated jeeps remained in the United States, even during the war. After more than sixty years, there are probably none left. Several organizations and dealers have had a substantial reward offer for years for anyone who can produce one and no one has claimed the money.

My grandfather once bought a used amusement park ride on e-bay, and it came in a single package like this. Obviously it was much larger, delivered on a flatbed tractor trailer.

My family spent a couple weeks helping him assemble it in our corn field, but we had to stop just short of completion when it became clear that it wasn't a theme park ride, but some gigantic animatronic roadside advertisement for a Venezuelan brothel.
Americans left a bunch of these behind in the Philippines after WW2 and filipinos turned it into an episode of Project Runway.

Ok, I got a response back from Arcaid. They told me the photo was placed with them by EWA, and gave me the name of a photographer, Friedhelm Thomas. http://www.ewastock.com/preview/83516

EDIT: 

I was able to speak with Friedhelm Thomas on the phone this morning. It was hard to communicate because of the language barrier, however I wrote them an email in English with a link to the image, asking if he took the photo and if he did, where it was taken. If they respond, I will post it here.


EDIT 2:

The photographer replied to my email, confirming that the photographer is Friedhelm Thomas and that they would respond on the weekend, when they have some help with responding to my email in English.


EDIT 3:

Friedhelm Thomas told me the photo is from 1985 and the steel and glass structure was dilapidated at that time. He does not know what happened to it since then.
The exact location of the photo was over the hotel Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo near Lake Como in northern Italy. The location of the wintergarden is Griante/Cadenabbia. The park belongs to Villa Maria, a variant of the world-renowned garden of Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo.

EDIT 4:

It looks like the Villa Maria has undergone a restoration since 1985.
Here is a [photo](http://www.mondolariano.it/GrianteCadenabbia/serrav.jpg) of it after
 restoration- [photo] (http://www.arteliberty.it/immaginiliberty/como/serra.jpg)

Another angle: [photo] (Here is a photo taken from abovhttp://www.alephcomo.com/Gallerie.aspx?gid=1&fid=1e:)
Here is what Google has to say about Villa Maria: "Villa Marie is surrounded by a splendid public park, in the centre of the village. It was built between 1889 and 1892 for the will of Martin Clerc and was completed by a heir of his, called Josephine May. The project was realized by the famous architect Giacomo Mantegazza."
I'm always curious what would cause a place like this to become abandoned.

Palasite class meteorite - the green yellow transparent minerals in this sample are the mineral [olivine](http://www.mindat.org/min-2983.html) which makes up most of the upper mantle of the Earth, while the metal parts are an iron nickle alloy, minerals in the alloy are [Kamacite (Iron with 7.5% Nickle) and Taenite (Iron with 25% Nickle)](http://www.meteoritemarket.com/mineral.htm). 

To get a mixture of the iron nickle alloy and olivine this meteorite came from a small protoplanet from the dawn of our solar system that melted from the original [chondrite](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/space/meteorites-dust/meteorite-types/stony/) material and separated into  an iron alloy and silicate phases (core and mantle). Towards the end of the protoplanet's life it experienced a very violent collision with another body and forced the contact between the core and the mantle to become perturbed via shockwaves from the impact- hence the mixing. 

Impacts like this lead to bigger and bigger bodies and eventually the terrestrial planets... so this is kind of an baby picture of the Earth.

Edit: [just wow](http://imgur.com/qBLSJ5s)
I lived with a roommate who had a great dog.  I loved that dog to the moon and back.  But it would bark at passers by.  It's the single only aggressive thing she ever did.  We didn't want her barking at the neighbors or their kids so we used to say "No, dog!  No barking!"  and she'd just look at us, then keep barking.

Then one day I kind of imagined what must be going through her head...  

She's like, "OH FUCKING SHIT! There are some assholes outside our badass good-guy-team castle! They're THREATENING our goddamn HOME fuckin' BASE!! RARARARAWR RAHRAWR!!!!"

And all she gets from us is just, "Bad, Dog! SHHHHHHhhhhhh! No Barking!!"

Panicked, she puzzles out the problem, realizing suddenly, *Oh SHIT! That's right!  You two helpless yet lovable lumps don't have the amazing sense of smell and super-dog-hearing that I do!*  But not to worry, that's exactly her job.  Let the humans know what's going on so they can let her out the front door to start killing shit.

Dauntless, she vows not to let the interlopers get by without warning everyone in the house first. 

"I WILL FUCKING PROTECT YOUUUUUUUuuuu! RHAWRHAHRAHRAWR RAWRRAH!!"

And suddenly feel like the poor girl is just trying to keep us safe.  So after I imagined this whole scenario out I kind of decided to try changing my approach the next time.  So the following interaction went completely differently.

She started barking, and this time instead of, "Shhh, NO!" I was like "Good Job, pooch! I see them too!" And I came up and patted her on the back.  And she chilled right the hell out.  Back to her nap.

I swear this worked 100% of the time.  She even kind of just started the habit of looking at me. If I was looking back she would just let it be.

"We good? Yeah, we good."

I miss that dog.  She's old now but still healthy. My roommate and I moved out of that place.  He's got some kids for the dog to play with so she's probably very happy.  

But I felt like the damn dog whisperer when I pulled that mind meld shit with the dog.  I bet it'll work for others too.  Seriously try it.  Let me know.

Am I the only one who wouldn't trust random strangers with this?
Of course now he will forever be pestering passers by for treats, which could potentially make some people quite nervous.
Now he'll learn to bark at strangers to get a treat. Cute idea, not solid in practice. On the other hand, that could be the lesser of two weevils.
ITT:  Lots of people who don't understand how dogs work.
That's a great idea! But aren't you afraid that he will warm up to strangers given this habit even if it's a robber in the middle of the night?
Irish Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier? 
What if he accidentally bites someone and they call animal control?
Has nobody noticed that they spelt it thaks, not thanks?
I don't agree with this approach, especially in this context. Dog will grow to expect treats from strangers. What about the one time that the stranger puts their hand out and there is no treat?  I'd prefer food refusal from strangers and to engage/train the dogs with other people around in order to desensitize them.
As great as this idea may seem, it's extremely counter intuitive.
I'm certified by the APDT and focus on dog psychology and behavior, and the first and foremost important thing to remember is that dogs are not humans and their psychology is completely different. Something that works one way in the human world can have a drastic difference in the minds of dogs.

I can go on for days as of why I would not recommend the method displayed in OP's picture, but I'll try to keep it short. I once worked with a 7 year old German Shepard named Daisy. Daisy had two bad habits; she would bark at the door when someone would stand outside/attempt to enter, and she was also terrified of fireworks. As humans, when we see that someone we care about is afraid of something, we tend to nurture them and tell them that "it's all going to be alright," etc. People do the exact same thing with their dogs when they seem scared or startled; they pet them and nurture them. The problem with this is the fact that what you're actually doing, despite of your good intentions, is encouraging their fear. Petting a dog is a form of encouragement and by petting them or nurturing them when their minds are in a scared state, you're actually feeding into the issue rather than helping it.

Now, back to Herbie. If Herbie has a fear of bypassers, then having them reward her state of mind is not what you'd want to do. You have to make sure (this is really important!) that you reward the right state of mind. Dogs live in the now; not yesterday or tomorrow. You have to make sure you can comprehend what state of mind your dog is in before you start rewarding them with treats. 

Those are just my two cents...
Fence aggression is caused by the neglectful action of leaving dogs unattended outside in a yard. 

The dog sees a passerby and begins barking. 

The passerby has no reason to stop and engage the dog and so continues on their way. 

The dog associates the passerby leaving as their having driven them off.

This gets reinforced every time that a passerby transits the fence line.

The real solution is to actually TRAIN your dog to not ever bark at passerby by staying with them during the first TWO years of their life when outside to properly TRAIN them not to be an ANNOYING noise disturbance, NOT hand the responsibility over to strangers that don't want hear your dog BARKING at them, not to mention the neighbors, and be tasked with doing what YOU should be doing.

tl;dr It's your dog, you fucking train it.
Herbie The Love Dog
Before:
Bark bark bark (get away from my home!)

After:
Bark bark bark (give me treats!)
From a veterinary student: Never punish a dog to treat fear. You would be pairing fear with fear which strengthens the initial fearful stimulus. Just wanted to say that first so people don't beat their dogs when they cower at fireworks. Now for the initial case, giving him treats when he barks at people he will bark more. He thinks "whenever I bark I get treats". So you reinforce the behavior. Unfortunately there is not a great way to treat this one if the owner isn't present because people ignoring the dog and walking by makes him think "barking at people makes them leave". And if this is his goal, the behavior has been reinforced. However the case with fireworks is a little different. This would be an example of counterconditioning. You should pair a positive stimulus with the fearful stimulus. So give treats and attention when fireworks happen. They realize when fireworks happen good things happen too. Thunder shirts provide comfort and can work great with mild fear of fireworks. Punishment though, is really never the first thing to go to and can really damage the human-animal bond. 
I bet he still barks at them though because he thinks he's being rewarded for barking at them as they passed by.

Because schools are built with tax payer money and stadiums are built with.... Oh wait. IDK
In case anyone is wondering: 

[In December 2011, the Santa Clara City Council voted for an agreement that calls for the citys Stadium Authority to borrow $850 million from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. This will cover most of the construction costs, with the remainder to be made up via funding from the NFL, a hotel tax and city redevelopment funds. Interest, fees and terms for this loan have not been disclosed.\[66\]\[67\] The $850 million building loan, plus interest and fees will be assumed by the City's Stadium Authority, where additional interest and fees will be applied. On February 2, 2012, NFL owners approved a loan to the 49ers of $200 million for use in constructing the new stadium, and to be taken from a new G-4 stadium loan fund.\[68\] Terms of the loan were not specified, but under the previous G-3 plan, money was repaid directly into the league's account from the borrowing team's share of gate receipts from road games.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium#Financing_and_construction)

I live in San Francisco and I don't remember it being too contentious of a subject, but the Bay Area in general is dealing with the effects of extreme income inequality and gentrification right now. 

Plus some feelings might have changed after the clusterfuck that was super bowl city. 
Very true.  My highschool burned down in 1998.  It took us almost six months to even get textbooks.  We had to eat in circus tent half the next year.  There was even a proposal of taking all our money, building a brand new school on the rich side of town, and then give us the old school they were currently using in the middle of town.  They didn't even start building the new school a month before I graduated in 2000 because the idea of building a modern school on the poorer side of town was so controversial.  Granted it did only take a year to build from that point.  But I only had a school for two out of four years because of politics.
Because the type of company hired to build a stadium consists of proactive doers. The type of company hired to fix a school consists of lowest bidders.

Because you're in it(school) three quarters of the year.

Edited for those that needed help.
> Why does it take a year to build a stadium

Because it doesn't. Taking a quick trip [over to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium), here are the key dates:

* 2007: Santa Clara starts working on project to build a stadium
* 2008: negotiations begin
* June 2009: agreement is made between 49ers team and city of Santa Clara
* December 2009: owners of Great America file lawsuit, which is dismissed
* June 2010: voters approve plan (Measure J).
* 2011: 49ers begin pre-sales of seats, boxes
* December 2011: Santa Clara secures funding
* February 2012: 49ers secure funding
* April 2012: groundbreaking at construction site
* July 2014: stadium opens

If you include everything, it basically took 7 years. Even if you forget all the planning and financing, construction itself took over 2 years, and obviously there would have been a lot of design work before that (probably going back to shortly after the Measure J approval).
Maybe your school is full of vandals.
/r/ToMotivateYou
Because it took longer than 1 year to build Levis stadium.


>The official groundbreaking took place on April 19, 2012.

>The stadium opened on July 17, 2014.

So the graffiti is a lie.


Not to mention school renovations and repairs are often scheduled around school days, so that education isn't interrupted by construction work. So generally there are major pushes to have everything in place for stages to begin and end over the summer months when students are out of school.
Money is part of it - but also harder work. A hard-working owner/manager is chasing down the  contractors for any delays of his stadium - as a delay will lose him money. He will double check plans, call suppliers to make sure all is running smoothly etc. Your local bureaucrat is not putting in that extra effort for your school fixing/building.
/r/im14andthisisdeep
Good question. Because the way government chooses contractors is completely fucked. I recommend reading up on it.
Ya, I spent 4 years in portables because the man closed the local high school down, in a town pretty close to the stadium. Was deemed unfit and unsafe if the next big earthquake hit. I feel that "artist" and his struggle.
Because the team can leave the city, you likely can't.
Why does it take a year to build Levi stadium and two years to build US bank stadium:(
Maybe because of graffiti
quick, tangible returns for investors and someone gets to stay as ceo of x company and x politician gets to stay in office for a few more years
Because California is broke due to a million reasons including pensions and money wasted on thousands of driver's licenses and medical given to illegal aliens. Yes I said it llegal aliens fuck you.
John Oliver did [this piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcwJt4bcnXs) about stadiums a while ago.  
Same reason Mexican resorts are rebuilt so fast after a hurricane. THEY MAKE MONEY!
Because your parents are too lazy to vote!
Because poor children don't make government officials money.  But kickbacks from billionaires do.
I regularly run on that trail and have never noticed that tag... 
I'm in the STL area and everyone is talking about the Rams leaving and getting an MLS stadium built in the area and I'm still sitting here like, "What the fuck?  Why are we even considering spending money on a stadium when we've got school districts who have been unaccredited for more than a decade?"

We are pumping out entire generations of children who "graduate" from high school with a 2nd grade reading level, absolutely no marketable skills, no hope for the future, living in bad areas filled with violent crime, and we are worried about a stadium?

It's only a matter of time until things get much, much worse around here.  We've already let things go for FAR too long, but when the AP students in a school only have teachers in 3 of their 7 classes in a day, what hope do any of them have at having a real life?

We have got a lot of work to do and meanwhile the deeply, **DEEPLY** racist people around here are all scrambling to find another major league team to come and let us pay for a stadium for them.

It's obscene how passionate some people are for sports in this city versus how utterly ignorant or apathetic they are about these important issues.  A few miles of freeway isn't going to protect us all forever and eventually, ignoring a huge swath of our population and basically relegating them to a life of poverty with the white flight epidemic in this area is going to come back to bite us HARD.

And in the meantime, people are suffering.

Go Blues!

"Charlie, whats is that? Is that the wall of water?!"
I sometimes have this exact nightmare 
What a lot of people who've never been to Hawaii don't understand is that the shorebreak isn't just a big wall of water like this.  It's a big wall of water crashing on an often steeply sloped beach.  Waimea isn't quite as bad as some others (like Secret Beach on the north shore of Kauai), but the best thing to do is imagine being slammed into a sand wall by a water wall.  Not fun.  Here's a [pic](https://78176764cdceab826ac0-52c38bba04a481c0c6f58bdb717e6a18.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/images/tatties/000/000/950/web/210_KeikiWall.jpg?1401199197) to illustrate it a little better.

ITT : snakes on a plane 
THARS A SNAKE IN MY BOOT
enough is enough ive had it with these monkey fighting snakes on this monday to friday plane
It is a Cessna(the plane, not the snake), probably a small one, so its not still airborne 6 hours later. 

Where did your buddy take off from?

Any chance  the radio transmissions with the tower at the destination are available. I would give a lot to hear that one.

(Squawk) This is Cessna N 5654Foxtrot coming in  on Runway 32. I have a possibly venomous rattle snake in my right front tire and may need some assistance . Is there ground crew with a  22 available? Over.
Planes pick them up while passing through the snakosphere all the time. But Obama's FAA refuses to acknowledge the problem.
Did it fall off or did he have to battle it after he landed?

This is the cat equivalent to an opium den. 
Well if it doesn't prevent mosquitos it certainly will prevent mice! ... and birds... and small tree rodents... and a few spiders here and there.
... Is it working?
The town I live in has a really bad feral cat problem. The kitties kept pooping in my raised bed garden and eating my spinach and lettuce. I put some catnip in there, in the hopes they'd leave the other stuff alone. Sadly, they weren't super attracted to it. Then one day I cut off a few bruised leaves. I threw the leaves at a cat and the lil bugger went crazy. It looked at me like "WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY DIDN'T I KNOW ABOUT THIS?" A bunch of other feral cats heard the commotion and came over. Obviously they wanted some too. Now whenever the cats see me, they run up and meow, begging for a little hit of the good stuff.  
&nbsp;

TLDR: Ive become a catnip dealer to a gang of feral cats
I once was walking home late at night. There's lots of stray cats in the city, and on this particular night I walked by a driveway with several strays. They were all sitting in a circle facing each other. Was one of the strangest things I've seen.

Edit: Damn Reddit, you sure can supply me with silly cat stories every 5 seconds.

Actually, I'm pretty sure none of those plants are catnip.

Does this actually work? If it does I may replace my entire yard with catnip. Mosquitoes are my mortal enemy. 
Neko Atsume irl.
My brother thought it would be a good idea to plant a patch of catnip in the backyard.  He was no fool though, he put a little fence around it, smart eh?  Our big Maine Coon cat though dug under that fence like a badger on steroids and we found him passed out like a junkie in a patch of stems.
The youngest ones are the toughest to see.  Look at the little orange and white one, center right, looking at the camera.  He has his whole life ahead of him and he doesn't even know it!  Bless his heart.  Plants are such a scourge in today's youths.

There is absolutely no catnip in that picture.

I wonder why the cats are there because I don't see any catnip.
I had an indoor cat when I moved here, so I planted some catnip near each door to try to trap her if she got out. It worked both times she escaped, and now my neighbor's cat visits regularly. 10/10 do recommend.

I enjoy that this narrowly avoids the trend of dressing up unenthusiastic children to entertain adults by making the child part of the costume rather than merely a victim of it.

That facial expression on the common snapping turtle is somehow both cute and terrifying.

Clearly Alligator Snapping Turtle is just the evolved form of the Common Snapping Turtle. #GottaCatchEmAll
Haha I was just commenting on alligator snapping turtles on another thread the other day.

These fuckers  can grow over 200lbs,  the largest rumored to have been found was over 400lbs in Kansas in the 30s.  

Fear the turtle!
The common, on the right, is much more aggressive than the alligator on the left.

They're both mean as hell.

I was once fishing and was wading into a lake up to my waist.  I had a HUGE alligator snapping turtle come up out of the water and his head was literally RIGHT next to my balls. 

The fucker hung out there for like 30 minutes... then slowly went under the water.  

The water was murky and I couldn't see him when he was under so I had no idea what to do.

I had to wait another hour to leave... was worried about being bitten by bumping into him in the muck.  
so one can take a bite out of my leg, and the other can just eat the whole leg pretty much.
Stay away from their heads. They got more neck reach than most realize.

As a herpetologist I've found this is a great way for two turtles to fuck each other up. That eastern snapper would do a fast bite on the alligator snapper but then the alligator snapper will just bite the head off the eastern. 
....Let them fight.
When you get a common snapping turtle to 25% health, there's a cutscene where it transforms into an alligator snapping turtle.

The very earliest rover, Sojourner, which was landed in 1997 was roughly dog-sized, depending on the dog.  [Lots of dogs](http://i.imgur.com/FdzQB.jpg).
I guess Rover is a typical dog name... maybe that's why I assumed the same thing?
http://i.imgur.com/fWscgzA.jpg
Thanks, wall-E for messing up my perception of space roving robots
Pretty much every article and press release leading up to the landing made a point of how it was the size and weight of a VW beetle. A nuclear powered VW beetle.

That's why it needed the rocket/skycrane landing, It was too heavy to bounce like Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity.
Such a tiny woman.
I always thought they should put a lego man or something like that on the rover so you'd see it in selfies the rover sends back.
We landed a goddamn SUV on a planet that is barely more than a speck of reddish light when viewed from my back deck.  This happened not even 110 years from our first flight.  Go Science!  
To help put it into perspective, those wheels are nearly 20" diameter (50 cm). Just because NASA could, they spell out "JPL" in Morse code when they roll. You can somewhat see some of the letters in the front left wheel (right behind the woman) and on the mid right wheel. Curiosity weighs 899 kg (~2000 lbs) and needs a 9.5'x8.9' parking spot - which is wider than a semi truck. 

We truly did launch a space car to Mars when she lifted off the day after Thanksgiving in 2011.
Here is an awesome video about the image you're looking at... 

Watch "The Drill we sent to Mars - Smarter Every Day 143" on YouTube
https://youtu.be/Qa2sc6-u59I

It's a model of the Curiosity Rover that JPL scientist can use to figure out any problems that might happen with the actual Rover. Pretttyyyy cool! 

Destin, the creator of Smarter Every Day is a reddit user. I forget his username, something about a penny whistle or something. Great videos, though! 
I don't even know who that person is or what they do but I envy them immensely.
This should also help you understand why it wasnt possible to land this rover with bouncing airbags like the others, and neccesitated the [insanely awesome] sky crane landing.
We all thought this because there wasn't anything to compare it to in its pictures on Mars.
Seeing how big the Mars rovers are in real life was one of the many, many very cool things about visiting the Kennedy Space Center.
Does Clifford count?
The thing that confused me when I first saw it was the lack of solar panels. But apparently, it's powered by a [radioisotope thermoelectric generator.](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator)
I knew full well it was the size of a car... Did nobody remember watching the landing? Didn't that come up?
Here is a bigger version. https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2014/05/img_3396.jpg?quality=80&strip=all also this is a nearly replica of the Curiosity rover at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab used for testing software updates etc.

LOOK AT IT'S LITTLE FLOWER POT!!

How did they get that to bloom??? I have floating plants in my aquarium and can never get a bloom.

That would be so rad to look up and see every night.
If anybody's wondering, we're expected to collide with the Andromeda Galaxy in about 3.75 billion years. Start building your galaxy-collision bunkers now!
Some smart creature living in the Andromeda must have posted the exact same thing on Milky Way on their Reddit
It's coming right for us!
It is possible that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the Milky Way looking up and thinking about the Andromeda galaxy in the same way we are.

And we never know about each other because they are 50,000 light years away.
I read that as "actual size if it were bigger"

Confused me for a minute. 
Doesn't even have to be brighter, I'm just sad about how much light pollution there is an how difficult it is to even see our own galaxy.
Who do we talk to about getting that turned up?
If it were visible in the entire human history, world today would most likely be very different.
Incredible. Astronomy is the most magnificent and beautiful yet terrifying and complex discipline. 
I always wonder what effects extra celestial bodies such as this would have on development of world religions.  
I used to live there. Some day I will find my spaceship and return.
Just think about all the things that could be going on in that small collection of light in our night sky...
I'll never forget the first time I realized this. I was at my grandparent's house in hillbilly land, far away from any lights. I was using their binoculars just looking at the stars in the night sky and suddenly it was in my view, and it was spectacular. I felt so small
If it had looked like that throughout history, religions would claim that it was "Heaven."
I questioned this so I decided to do some math

---
Andromeda -

2.4 x 10^19 km away

2.08131625 × 10^18 km wide

viewable ratio: .0867

---

Moon -

375,000 km away

3,474 km wide

viewable ratio: .009

---
It checks out if you could see all of Andromeda, it would be almost 10x as wide as the moon in the sky.
It is a pity our eyes don't have a long exposure setting. You would think it would just be a software upgrade.
As beautiful as this is, pictures like this make me feel sad about how insignificant I am in the grand scheme of things.

I was snorkeling in Southern California, and encountered many seals that looked like this. It really is a different kind of feeling seeing one of these animals in the water compared to a fish. Unfortunately I dropped my camera in the seaweed, never to be recovered. Congrats on keeping this picture long enough to download it haha

For my nephew's 25th birthday, the family all contributed something towards a time-capsule to be opened on his 50th.  The usual things like magazine/newspaper articles were put into the capsule (plus candies, Scotch, letters, and a few other fun things). 

My aunt from overseas sent a book on endangered species.  I thought it was a brilliant gift for a time capsule.  It will be interesting to see how many of those species will have made it to the year 2038.  
Here's where you can throw money at it to fix it --> http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/rhinoceros/asian_rhinos/sumatran_rhinoceros/ 

Yes, there is roughly 100 left in other countries. But the minimum viable population for any species is generally between 50-150. That means this species is extremely close to being doomed to die out. I'm not associated with the WWF or any related organisations, and I would encourage anyone to do their own research before donating, but I hope at least one person will consider it. 
It should be changed to extirpated. They still exist in other areas of the world but have been extirpated in Malaysia

Why humans can't have nice things 
Way to go, humans.
Humans are shit 
Goddamm dentists!
Idk why but some small part of me is disgusted with my self as a human being for being on the earth and allowing this kind of shit to happen. 
There are still more Sumatran rhinos in Sumatra and Borneo.

And you'd think reddit hates China or something. Sumatran rhinos aren't often poached. And even if they are, Chinese people don't typically make viagras out of rhino's ivory.
I'm just surprised the little guy has hair.
Fuck humans
Just to clarify why rhinos (in general) are going extinct, and why it will happen so quickly: Of course, one of the larger factors is poaching, and is probably one of the easiest for you all to donate towards. Because of this poaching, scientists have essentially been forced to breed rhinos in a way that does not promote genetic diversity (we don't want to say that they are essentially inbred, but they are almost clones of each other). Because of the lack of genetic variance, any small thing (diseases, disruption in food source, geographic dislocation, etc.) will pretty much wipe them off the face of the earth. 

Also, in case you didn't know, cheetahs are in the same boat. Although their numbers in the wild are relatively large at the moment, any small disease could wipe out wild cheetahs in the next year.
One day in the future kids are going to find it hard to believe that animals once lived in the wild and that the wild used to consist of something more than a fucking Walmart parking lot. 
Just so some rich dudes in China can try to get their dicks hard.

It was taken on Taken on June 23, 2012 by the International Rhino Foundation.  They provided the following caption:

> The new baby was born in an enclosure (boma) constructed especially for this event, but he and his mother have access to a small forest garden as well. Both remain under 24-hour video surveillance for health and safety reasons, and also have the benefit of visiting rhino specialists from Australia and the United States, who will remain at the sanctuary for the next few weeks.

[Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_rhinoceros)
Good job Humanity. *slow clap*
When anything goes extinct, or "extirpated", it makes me want to  cry. Am I alone in this?
Fuck.
Quick, someone call John Hammond.  I believe he has an island for just this type of thing.
As a zookeeper I cared for a Sumatran (hairy) Rhino for many years. She was a fantastic creature!  Quite gentle, and tons of personality. One of my top five animals I ever worked with!  So sad to hear this. I remember back when the Tsunami happened there were tons of reports that the Rhinos in the region were the first indicator that something was about to happen.  What a fine way to repay the favor.  Say what you will but this is why zoos and the SSP are sometimes the best chance we have to correct our travesties.  Don't forget to support your local zoological institution.  There is a great deal of noble work happening there they the public does not. See. Ok commence the zoo hate. 
Thanks Humans.
This is the first time I have ever seen this type of Rhino! Sad its when I find out that they are extinct. 
this is an early casualty of the inevitable mass extinction event set in motion by humans since the Industrial Revolution... average temperature, weather anomaly occurrences, extinction occurrences, & CO2 parts per million are all rising in unison, & not by coincidence

As a welder, this gets me amped up!
I just realized, I am totally talentless!
how big is this? 

Here is the OC posted to miller welds explaining the piece.

"Miller Man" Maquette of large sculpture for ITW Welded Steel with a marble base 24" x 7" x 7" By David Madero - 

I first used a Spectrum 875 plasma cutter to cut out the initial design from a steel tube. I then used a Millermatic 252 to spot weld steel rods on the tube as a base for the texture and the welding man figure. I continued by welding the gaps and unions between the steel rods leaving a highly texturized surface.  I finished the process using a Diversion 180 tig welder to form puddles giving the hills and valleys appearance.

This is what being a cop, firefighter or EMT is about. Knowing that your action made a difference. Good job sir, and congratulations on the graduation.

This is Art Deco railroad Underpass in Birmingham.
Its the gateway between the heart of downtown and Railroad Park.
Looks like Jeremy's tunnel in Achievement City. 
This is where you go after beating the mushroom cup, flower cup, and star cup.
It's like the entrance to gay heaven.
Like a lot of people have said already, this is in Birmingham, Alabama. What a lot of people don't know is that Birmingham is a kind of oasis in Alabama, especially near the university (where this tunnel is). It's not nearly the gay hating, racist place it used to be.
Hey, I live in Birmingham! I love this tunnel. 
I'd ride through that with Gene Wilder at the helm...
Lil J has been building in the real world I see.
It's in downtown Birmingham, AL. Actually there are a few of these rainbow tunnels that span under the railroad tracks in town. I live downtown and can see this tunnel as I am typing this... Weirrrrddd
Hey Color Tunnel! This is in Birmingham Alabama! Thank God something cool on Reddit about Alabama, it's rare.

I'd love to see a movie called "The Joker" that details a Joker after the Batman has gone into seclusion, and what lengths he'll go to get him back.  Walk inside his fractured mind for a while, never knowing what's really real.

If they ever made a live action "The Dark Knight Returns" he would be great.

[Streets of Fire Dafoe](http://content6.flixster.com/photo/10/30/05/10300588_tml.jpg)
Personally I think he'd make a better Two Face, but I guess that's just me. Dafoe has a certain kind of crazy look that befits Two Face's identity crisis a lot better. He pulled it off well with Green Goblin and a more comic-version of Two Face (who acts a bit different from movies and games) would suit Dafoe really well, I think.

He could probably do Joker crazy just fine too, but I think Two Face would end up coming out better.
Simple, his dick is too big.
Already been the Green Goblin.
Easy - he doesn't want his ass kicked.

He'd be waaay too convincing and the next thing you know, the real Batman is showing up at his place throwing elbows and grunting all throatily. 
How about for a Batman Beyond movie?
He can't be. He is simply not Dafoe Batman needs.
Because it would terrify people.

That raises a question that I've been wondering but haven't asked and haven't seen any news on. I thought DC said that the picture that leaked of Joker covered in the "HAHAHAHAHAHA" emo tattoos was just a promotional thing. They're visible in the trailer. Does anyone have any info on this?
The world is not ready for those kind of nightmares. 
jesus fuck do you want to give batman nightmares?  Joker's supposed to be a supervillain, not satan incarnate.

My grandfather was fortunate enough to attend a lecture by Einstein when he was at Princeton. My grandfather is a lawyer, never took much of an interest in physics, but he wanted to see what it was like. He says he understood most of what Einstein said, but very little of what he was talking about.  
I wonder if there were students there dying to get out and not paying attention like any typical class.
"Alright ya fucks, listen up". 
I worked in a retirement home where a ninety some year old woman would tell me every day that she took classes at Princeton and that einstein was the "worst teacher ever". She said he was never on time and his mind was never focused on the lecture, always something else. She said she told him once that he wasn't a very good teacher and that he just shrugged, hands in his pockets, no change of expression.
That would be one intimidating class to raise your hand in.  
That's the face of "how do you not get it, the fuck did I just say?"
I heard a story from my physics professor that Einstein was a notoriously bad lecturer, because he was sort of *too* smart. He'd throw up equations on the chalkboard, but couldn't explain the logic behind them very well. He was so bright that the concept he talked about just made sense to him without much effort. 
That man's name? Albert Einstein. 
Einstein is rocking the chub and tuck. Papa Bless.
"Becky... Put your goddamn phone away!" 
Ya know if your teacher dresses casual as fuck you're gonna have a hard time.
Students: When is he gonna fill up that board?

Teacher: We're not moving on until you get this part first.

Students: Wait, did he just put everything known to physics into one line?
did einstein have to teach phy101 and 102? like was he in the rotation with the other professors and got stuck with it every few years?
Not gonna lie, I thought this was /r/streetwear for a second. 
I would give so much to sit in that classroom.

That's pretty sweet of him to keep in touch with his old coach.

Also, nice 'fro.
That's Roger Murdock, he's an airline pilot!
But isn't the first pic Lew Alcindor with Coach Wooden?
That's really touching, kind of amazing that these two have been together for so long.

They probably couldn't be so open about it back then, different times..
wow John Wooden really shrunk i guess i have that to look forward to
XL t-shirts have changed dimensions since then. 
When UCLA ruled the world. Those were some amazing times and teams.
I think you have him confused with someone else.  His name is Roger Murdock, He's the co pilot.
I know Simmons makes this point a lot, but look at Kareem's shoes. They are so primitive compared to today's basketball shoes. It's a real testament to Kareem's preparation and physicality that he was able to play for so long with the equipment and medicine that existed from the 60s-80s. 
"Kareem, you don't work hard enough on defense."
Love both these guys and they just ooze class.  I always loved how John Wooden would write his wife a love letter every month even after she passed away. He would leave the letter on her pillow in a stack tied by a yellow ribbon. He also would not sleep on her side of the bed and never between the sheets once she passed. 
Two class acts. I'm a believer in Will being the greatest of all time, but Kareem was class all the way. Kept his mouth shut but was passionate and controlled. Learned a lot about life from Wooden.
I met Kareem in Amsterdam in 2012! He was huge! Lemme see if I can find the picture. 

EDIT: Never fuckin mind, I met Hakeem Olojuwan. I can't spell or remember jack shit. Here is pic anyways. http://imgur.com/BNKf8BC
"Roger, Roger."

"Huh?"
I think I was there when they took the picture on the right! I had UCLA season tickets. 

Coach Wooden was still attending almost every home game. At some point during the evening the camera would go to him at his seat and the crowd would give him a huge round of applause.
He looks like a pilot.
Had a chance to meet John Wooden, his son lives across the street from my childhood home. Nice guy, never realized until I was older how truly amazing of a coach he was to so many players.
He is still alive?
Legends.
Both awesome men!
Both before my time but I wish they weren't. Two legends and great picture. Thanks OP 
Wooden lived to 99.  
I hate to burst your bubble, but a triple double trouble is coming to your town and he's gonna make trouble 
Go Bruins!
That's not Kareem, that's Captain Lance Murdoch!

People used to do something similar back when it was expensive to send letters. Link related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter

Also, I heard a story of a student who was in a class where the teacher allowed students to only write on one side of a sheet. He twisted the sheet and attached it to itself as a Möbius strip.
I always loved note-card allowed exams. I thought I was getting one over on the teacher (Hah! I wrote suuuuper small, take that!) but I always ended up learning more of the material because I actually spent time studying by putting together my card.
I had a classmate in high school peel the index card apart into layers and then print off typed notes to paste on each layer. The kid ended up with like 5 extra sides on his notes. The teacher was so astounded that a 16 year old would think of this that he allowed the kid to use the note card.  From then on out, that teacher clearly stated that this isn't allowed. Talk about interpretating the rules haha.

PS: Forgive my grammar mishaps (I know its interpreting), as the drunken redneck within me came out last night.
My Differential Equations professor always used to say, you may use one piece of paper. If you are creative enough, you can use all 6 sides.
When they wear them on each eye the answers pop out in 3D
This kid is going places
Why the hell aren't they printing a 3x5 notecard in 3 point fonts and bringing reading glasses?
Story time:

There was a legend in the math department at my college that a professor allowed students to use an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper full of notes for the final exam.  The only problem was that the prof didn't specify units of measurement so some smart-ass (or possibly genius) student got a hold of a sheet of butcher paper that was 8 1/2 FEET by 11 FEET.  Since the prof hadn't specified units of measurement, he ended up letting the kid use it, but from then on he always made sure to say that an 8 1/2 INCH by 11 INCH sheet of paper could be used for notes on the final.

I will say that your student's method of bending the rules is far more creative and less smartassy than the student in my story.
I did something similar, except for a multivariable calculus final. We were allowed both sides of a 5" × 7" notecard. So I wrote out my notes first horizontally on the card, then turned the card 90° and wrote in a different color on both sides again.
So long as you use colors that are markedly different and not too dark, it works well.
So that kid gets an A for being a genius right?
The thing I remember most about these notecard style exams is that most of the stuff I wrote down I ended up remembering just from the act of taking the time to write it.  I ended up just using the card to double-check stuff so I didn't feel I made it in vain.
Where was this post a couple days ago? I could have used this on my final.
I had a teacher specifically forbid this because she had seen it before. 
Playing with legos all the time (and hunting for the right color part in a mixed bin) as a kid developed in me the ability to "blur out" all colors but the one I'm looking for. I have done this with six colors and no lenses. Works great.
THE MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL
That's some jimmy newton shit
Ah, but you didn't say they could also use red and blue strips of plastic for filters.  "A" for creativity, but abject failure for the crime of NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. 
My teachers in college said that we could use our books during the exam. Whenever that happened, everyone realized that the exam was going to be so hard that the books wouldn't even be helpful. Sadly to say, this was indeed the case.
A teacher once told my class to "only use a 3 by 5 note card." My best friend came in with a huge piece of paper made of other papers taped together with most the chapter written on it. The teacher asked what he thought he was doing so my friend explained that she never specified 3 by 5 inches and that his paper was 3 by 5 feet. He said it was still 3 by 5 so he was still following the rules. She let him get away with it but never forgot to say inches after that.

Seeing extremists destroy ancient sites/documents makes me so angry
"Picture of Text"
Look like a game of thrones scene. I have always loved arabic books, art, cloth, it all looks so fantastic. 
Full story [here](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-librarian-who-saved-timbuktus-cultural-treasures-from-al-qaeda-1460729998)
I have always found it intersting that these so called Islamists always destroy everything to do with Islamic history.
I catch myself getting angry or at least irked at the fact that so many cultures' history is destroyed due to...well...people taking over I guess. Rome is a big destructor of the Celtic culture as a whole (as far as history I mean) and I'm always wanting to know more about the celtic culture...So, thank God for men like this, who risk their safety (I assume) to preserve such documents/pieces of culture and history.
Is he [Xaro Xhoan Daxos](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Xaro_Xhoan_Daxos)?
For hundreds of years the Librarians of Timbuktu have done this. Risking everything they have, their lives, and their families to float crates of books down the Niger river and protect them from invading forces. There's a reason that Mali has always been connected with publishing and warehousing of knowledge; this is it.
This man is a hero in... my book.
This is a wonderful human being. Even as a white Westerner, this makes me feel as if my culture has been preserved and it gives me a strong and sudden feeling of affiliation (in the literal, brotherly sense of the word). Much of the information saved goes so far back so as to exist in the collective cultural heritage of so many of us,  despite our more recent and disparate geographical origins. 
Is this the what the terrorists wanted to blow up in CS1.6 all along.
Scan that shit and put it online. It will soon be dust. Why not save it?
gotta say the dude looks happy he had saved anything at all

Not opal.. Literally can't knapp opal. I just got back from a cross country trip hunting obsidian and opal and have done tons of homework. More than likely that's glass. Ninja edit because phrasing. 
Not opal... and not "Native American" either... 
I'll give you 23keys for it.
Also known as a crysknife
CS:GO please...
Lies! That is dragon glass.
It says fire opal, but I bet it does ice damage.
(+10 damage) (+10 frost) when wielding.
"In the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal. It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye."

From wikipedia, It doesn't say anything about Native American use or much about how strong the blabe is.

Not opal and not Native American. Truthfully I get kinda pissed at someone taking a bit of leather, a piece of fur maybe some Walmart beads, slapping a few feathers and calling it Native American. This is beautiful work, it's a shame it has such a misleading title.
Just looking at it makes me want to scalp a white man.

Edit: Red head scalps are worth extra
This weapon is usually used by a giant woman
+2 fire  +1 mana regeneration +1 stealth 
The preferred weapon of the Mistborn. 
A blink dagger! 
As someone who buys and sells knives as a hobby and just happens to love opals I join everyone else in calling bullshit. First off this opal would have to be fuckin huge to be able to shape it like this. Secondly, fire opals aren't able to be shaped in this fashion. If this were real I'd be ready to drop bread on one
I don't know... Then I have to get the whole set for 6 persons with the moonstone forks and the ruby cups. It's just too expensive, especially when we don't entertain much. 
What are its stats?
This is an absolutely beautiful knife.
I'll give you 5 fire and ices, a  fn dragon lore, and 3,000 keys.

5.Oh my God why won't it stop growing?!  
6.Did I used to have a garden and a house? Was there a time before the rhododendron forest?!  
7.Please for the love of God neighbours if you can hear me bring chainsaws  
8.Why won't it stop growing?! Why won't it die?!  
9.Maybe if I trim it constantly without eating or sleeping or pooing I can't reach an equilibrium and contain it?  
10.They call me the rhododendron man, I had another name once in a lifetime a long time ago..

OP's post is not a letter from the greatest postal worker in the world, it's just a tribute. 
Or the Grinch, posting this message with no intention of collecting the packages so they all end up late.
Good on him/her. Customer service and retail workers are the unsung heroes of Christmas, even though Christmas seems to bring out the worst in customers. Seriously. People: don't be a dick to the retail workers, many of them will do what this guy/gal did and go that extra mile to help you. Merry Christmas to all of you in customer service and retail, and to the World's Greatest Postal Worker (if you read this, which I hope you do.)
You did it! Congratulations! World's Greatest Postal Worker! Great job, everybody! It's great to meet you.
When I was a kid, I knew the postwoman who came to my house very well. I'd always get excited when I saw her coming close to my house, and run inside to get a sippy cup of water for her to drink. She was always super nice to me, and one of my favorite people to see. 

When I was about 8, my family moved to a new house. Our grandparents shipped the gifts to our old house by mistake. However, that postwoman saw our names on the package right before Christmas and went above and beyond to track us down and get us the presents to us in time. 

If she hadn't been so amazing, we would have gotten our gifts weeks late - if we had gotten them at all. 

I've always had such huge respect for the postal service. They always do an incredible job. 
Sadly most people will not give a fuck, or understand.  They will just be mad they cannot send shit 2 hours before xmas, and have it delivered xmas.  - Signed someone working in an xmas gift store.
Plot twist: The postal worker didn't post that, now has to cancel his plans to get this shit done

I didn't think you could leave a package over 13oz in a mail slot anymore?
Someone slip a six-pack or a bottle of wine in there for that most excellent mail purveyor.
Even if they pick it up later that day, it all depends on when the truck is leaving for the next stop. So there is a good chance it will just sit around.
Our local post office was closed this past Saturday.  The last Saturday before xmas.

That is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. 
Dumb question, but as a Canadian having never seen/heard of a fish this colourful - is it edible?

All I see is the cover art from Oldboy
Whatever you say Bladerunner...
I always thought these photos weren't super accurate, maybe sort of idealized - like, shots just hand picked to resemble Blade Runner - likely Japan wasn't that intense and crazy looking.


And then I went to Tokyo.

Holy shit, it's this times 100.

Even the tiny little dense block of restaurants and bars in the Corporate District (directly across from Shinegawa station) looked like this.

Roppongi was on another level. Absolutely nuts and surreal. Super narrow streets with massive flashing animated billboards covering everything.

And then [Robot Restaurant waiting room](http://www.vagabondsummer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Waiting-room.jpg) and [performance](https://www.google.com/search?q=robot+restaurant&safe=active&espv=2&biw=1607&bih=1190&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcqtKtlc3JAhUQ-mMKHRfTBegQ_AUIBygC#imgrc=_) almost gave me a mind seizure.


EDIT: Fuck. I need to go through and process all my photos from that trip. Damn!

2. Make a film set around that scene
Any chance of a 1080p version. 
Very cyberpunk
looks like the cover to Old Boy (an excellent film if you havent seen it already)   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/
It'd be cool if I had cybernetic eyes with built in filters. I could change the feel of any environment at will.
I think this is a screenshot from sleeping dogs
Besides the Blade Runner atmosphere of these photos, it also feels similar to Edward Hopper's Nighthawks painting because its focus of architecture and people as personalities of the scene. Very cool, thanks for turning me onto this artist.

When my Grandma was in hospice she and I were talking. She wanted to be outside again. She loved working in her garden and sitting on the porch watching the birds. I told her the hospice center had a big gazebo on the other side of the building with bird feeders and we should go check it out. She couldn't walk at this point and at that moment my cousins husband walked in. I told him to grab the side of the bed and we kicked the brakes off and took my grandma out to watch the birds. Walked past several nurses that looked at us funny but didn't say much. The nurse that  had been helping her just told us to bring her back. We sat out in this giant gazebo watching this group of sparrows go to town on the one bird feeder. It was the last time she went outside. 

I'm glad this guy got to see the forest again. 
That paramedic looks like he genuinely loves the fact he can do this for him. 
Any story on him? 
The woods are lovely dark and deep

But I have promises to keep

And miles to go before I sleep

And miles to go before I sleep
I think dying outside is the way to go ... fuck I'm crying all of a sudden
Fuck, this shit made me tear up in the middle of the airport, my passengers must be scared shitless watching their pilot cry a bit.
ok fucking stop it reddit, leave my feelings alone. 
I came here to laugh not to feel!
Crying at work now. Great. But I'd rather die surrounded by trees and looking at the sky, than stuck in a cold room staring at ceiling panels. 
He just wanted to see the stairs one last time.
My grandfather was also a park ranger...

Iwas going to write about his last time in the forest he loved, but I'm just gonna cry for a while instead. I miss him so much.
This reminds me if my nan :( I remember during her last years she couldn't really do much and got really ill. Living in England and never leaving she said to me "I really hope its a nice summer, I'd like one more" then it was a really nice one and she got so Ill she was permantly in hospital and couldn't see it.

She got heavy Alzheimer's and couldn't really remember us her life and it got really hard during visits like she would say to my mum (her daughter) "Do you have a mum" and then one day out of the blue she had perfect clarity and just took me to one side and  the last things she said is that "I shouldn't give up, I should always keep trying things and even if you don't like them just keep trying"

A few days later it was really sunny in her room and she had the blinds open, she couldn't speak or anything and she passed and I was so sad she never got that summer.

A few weeks after she passed my sister mentioned how she had another moment of clarity and said that " she is ready to go, is tired of it and she is ready and accepting"

I guess that's some consolation but death is so horrible. Urgh took me half an hour to type that from crying. God I never cry, feel like that has been pent up for years.

I still feel guilty for not seeing her more, she was such a lovely woman. Towards the end I didn't really understand how I'll she was, my num would say she was OK and it was only on her last days did I see her. I mean I saw her for many years but just that last year I never saw her much and I feel so bad about it.

Sorry reddit isn't the place for this, feels like I'm letting it out my system for the first time. Crazy how an image can do that
My very old grandmother had always regretted that she had never learned to drive a modern car.  She had driven a Model A & Model T.  

I made arrangement with a local farmer who seasonally bailed his  stock feed hay into those large round bales.  I took out to a huge field of them in my Bronco that had power steering, and just let her try to drive between them and among them.  She ran into a few (I put the truck in 1st gear) as we creeped along.  We laughed like fools, as she would get on the gas too hard sometimes, "getting a wheel and throwing dirt!"

She said it was one of the best times she every had.
Picture is getting kinda blurry... 
Awesome. They should make some heavy-duty off-road stretchers to make this easy to do.
I would not say it is sad but the oposite
May his crossing be painless. 
That's a druid, ladies and gentlemen.
The is actually in my home town Edmonds Washington. Fire District 1 takes really good care of the people around here and the same goes for their employees.
The Park looks like West County Park (which is a stones throw from my house) that or Yost Park. Both parks are pretty massive for being in the middle of town.
It's awfully lovely that they did this for him. I'm glad he got the chance to see what he worked so hard for one last time.
well damn that hit me harder than i thought it would.
I think I have pollen in my eyes.
Honestly, when I die I just want my family to leave me in the woods. I want to be reclaimed by the forest.
As someone else whose heart belongs to the forest...I cried instantly. Fuck.

The only one that's more difficult to pin than the ironclad beetle.
Meanwhile at the Volkswagen factory, there is a giant scarab hidden somewhere in the car lot.
That...is a Micro Machine. I had so many of those little cars as a kid.
Reminds me of a bug collection I once saw that included a piece of Redvine licorice. That's how I learned red-40 is made from bugs. 
Is there a reason why all the beetles are pinned in their right elytron?
When the famous British evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane was asked what his research had taught him about God, he replied, ["It would appear that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles."](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane)
they all evolved from that original beetle
That's the Montreal insectarium!   
They are renovating it currently! 

Edit : or, based on user posts, Cleveland 
They need to add John, Paul, George, and Ringo figures to this too. Just kind of mixed in and spread out. Bonus points for Pete Best, Brian Epstein, and George Martin.
The Museum of Science in Boston has a plastic flamingo in the bird display, section for "suburban" birds, I think.
I love humor like this. It's not crude, nothing is broken, no one gets hurt and it's subtle. You can almost feel the smile on the exhibit designer's face as they prepare it knowing for years to come their smile will be returned by patrons of the museum. It's a really neat kind of human connection.
They should give out prizes to anyone who notices. Free bugs!
Next to the exhibit of beetles, there should have been an exhibit of Beatles.
It is a Volkswagen "Maggiolino" (the Italian of Volkswagen Beetle). Maggiolino in Italian is also a coleoptera insect: see [Melolontha melolontha](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melolontha_melolontha) 
I was really expecting a [Beetleborg](http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Beetleborgs.jpg) while it loaded.

Also, mad props for anyone who realizes they re-used the Beetleborg costumes as bad guys in the [Power Rangers Forever Red](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v467/raz1337/Ricardo/08.jpg) movie.
On a serious note, beatles' variety is stunning.
I always thought this was one of the best little details that was in the movie Cars too. They have a couple scenes where there are VW Bugs buzzing round lights.
1960's bug Flat window yet not oval or split as well as the bumpers. 
Well...it is a beetle.

Pretty sure all those women's magazines are identical. From the '3000 ways to get extremely skinny FAST!' Article, to the '9 million ways to give him all the orgasms'..... And the conflicting 'eat this gigantic, decadent chocolate cake and still lose several thousand pounds' articles. 
What I find impressive is that OP got his or her new magazine in the mail and was like, "HOLD ON. WAIT A MINUTE. I REMEMBER THAT FROM THE JUNE 2014 ISSUE OF WOMEN'S HEALTH," then went and pawed through his or her archives to find the appropriate issue. 


A while back, I had a subscription to Men's Health. Really loved the magazine and all the articles. About a year and a half into my sub, after I got my newest issue, I decided to organize them. When I started doing this, I noticed my newest issue was essentially the exact same issue from a year before, except with a different person on the cover. Started looking through and they were all basically like this. A year goes by, different cover, same issue. Cancelled my sub right then and there. 
You can probably find 100 more in the same year. They all buy their market research from the same place.
It's ok, you can admit it if you bought an item, or two, or TEN for yourself.
Hey man, maybe some of us are new to woman's magazines, and we didn't see that specific magazine over two years ago!
Man, my grandmother use to collect a shit load of women's world, I tell ya, they've got some good recipes in there. You can learn a lot taking a dump at your grandma's house.
If this post was a repost it would be even better. 
Cosmopolitan magazine tells a woman how to have an orgasm.
Vogue magazine tells a woman how to have an orgasm in style.
Woman's Weekly tells a woman how to knit one.
I'm more curious about this Electric Sex. I could use a boost
A friend of mine did an internship with Cosmo in college. And she said they had file cabinets full of their old material and would use it for content. She said about 10% of each issue was new content. Often times they would just take old material and slap the hot star of the week on it and call it a day.

People never seem to get it. These magazines are to women with low self esteem what Archie digests are to children: Recycled good feelings.
* Lose weight by doing nothing

* Lose more weight from sex

* Eat everything and never get fat
Fun fact, despite being founded 24 years earlier, *Shape* has a circulation that's equal to *Women's Health.*
Makes sense. Bikini season happens every year. People always want to be in better shape, even if they aren't willing to work for it. 
The thing that always perplexed me about these "women's magazines" (and Woman's World is probably the most guilty of this): Almost every single issue, there are two big things on the cover: "Make these delicious treats!" and "Tricks / Diets to lose weight fast!"

Seriously, take a look the next time you're in the store. 99% of the time you'll find the cover of Woman's World has both of those. It's so absurd.
Magazine aimed at single woman: Get skinny fast!  How to get him off!

Magazine aimed at married woman: Bake this incredibly unhealthy cake!  How to lose 20 lbs!

Marketer here.

You aren't their target audience. 

These magazines do TONS of market research or "testing" behind the scenes. They interview dozens upon dozens of people behind closed doors and ask them random questions. A lot of the answers given may seem bullshit to us, but market research is about picking up on the "language" that your target audience uses today. Hence, you see a difference in the way weight loss is described in the latter version. Same thing, but their target audience now describes their pain points in a different lingo. 

I bet this magazine conducted hundreds of interviews and picked up on pain points, the way their readers think and talk, how they describe situations, etc before they even released this cover.

It's actually SUPER easy to conduct market/customer/user research now. In the past, companies had to do in person interviews and focus groups in order to understand their target audience. That would take WEEKS to organize and conduct... Super slow process and quite frankly, dreadful. Now they go to companies like UserTesting and launch a quick, remote test and within 20 minutes have all the research they need. 

Crazy world we live in!

Could someone explain how they would start this forging process on such a massive scale? 
[deleted]
I always think it's so interesting when they just use giant versions of things we're used to seeing on such a smaller scale, to make giant things, like that chain.
No that looks like a real one. 
[From another angle](http://i.imgur.com/WO3Np9e.jpg)
One of the reasons why Canada built CANDU reactors is because we don't have steel forges the built giant reactors like this.  CANDU reactors are stacked in smaller modular sections.  It was important to the people in charge at the time we build the reactor ourselves to have something to be proud of.  
Footage of forging at a similar scale. Pretty mind blowing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnx8GAxF3Ow
That chain is fucking massive! 
"we need something to hold up the axel"

"use a bike chain bro"

"...a bike chain is neither large or strong enough for this purpose"

"yeah but like, use a really big bike chain"

EDIT:typo
This is definitely the hottest pic I've seen all day.
It just dawned on me that humans as species are absolutely excellent at creating machines to do the work *for* us. 

I mean, that thing's massive. Just how incredible is it that we are capable of doing things like this?
Bit of a mislead; it's actually the reactor pressure vessel which will ultimately contain the core structure. But yes, it is massive! About 4m diameter and can be up to about 12m tall!

I have been trying to see a Luna Moth in person for so long; where was this taken? Seeing one casually hanging out on a pair of Iron Rangers makes me want to get a pair and stand in a forest waiting for one to land. Very jealous, dude.
You have been spooked by the sleep butterfly.
These guys will let you touch them if you're careful (oddly, most larger moths will in my experience).  That fur on the back is very soft.
Oh my god I used to go to camp in West Virginia and these were all over the place and let me tell you they are HORRIFYING. I already have a random deep fear of butterflies and moths but holy shit these things are fearless and fly at your face and because it's fucking illegal to kill them and they know it they're just smug little shits. 
Hello fellow Iron Ranger brother!
I guess you should talk to your doctor to see of Lunesta is right for you
That would be a male Actias luna, often mistakenly referred to as the lunar (rather than luna - see epithet) moth. Though fairly commonly, they're somewhat rarely seen because of their relatively short week-long adulthood. During this period of their lifespan, they do not have mouths, as a result do not eat, and exist solely to procreate.
This obviously was staged by the moths for the sake of bankrupting the butterflies. 
We used to have a shitload of these around when I lived in South Carolina. One night, I was just outside with some friends and one landed on my hand. I might have loudly shouted and flailed around like I was on fire.

The whole "No outside food or drink" has absolutely nothing to do with security...unless of course by security you mean securing profits.
It's just like how the club with the highest cover charge then *also* has the most ridiculous drink prices.

Saline bottle of vodka in armpit.  Been doing that at Heinz Field for around 10 years.  ;)
I dont know how many beer bottles I fit in my ass, but I'm going to find out.
Does no one go to sports events or concerts? 

At the arena in my city, draft beer is $8 or $12 depending on size. $15 no, but not far off. 

Beer is always overpriced at arenas and stadiums. 
Wow! Only $7.00 for a Bud Light!
You paid $3000/ticket to get in. A $15 beer should be chump change to you. 
Ahh, the Norwegian price

It's not a restaurant.

It's cafeteria in TCS, an IT company. Many companies display such data in the cafeterias.
We did this at my summer camp to make kids aware of food wastefulness and not taking more than they'd eat. Went from over 150 lbs of wasted food the first day down to 45 by the end of camp. 
Guess they're also serving up guilt there.
Near me there are a few "All You Can Eat Sushi" spots.

They will not serve you more until you clear everything on your plate. If you don't eat everything that came out, you can't order more. You also can't take it home.

This actually pissed me off the one time I went there with some people a while back. They make you order as a table. I'm very specific with sushi, so I ordered 2 or 3 specific rolls for myself, but when I finished they wouldn't let me order more because the table wasn't finished.

You see, the other people at my table were ... well ... idiots. They thought, "Hey, it's all you can eat! Lets just order everything, even the stuff that doesn't sound appealing!". 

They ordered more food than anyone could eat, didn't end up finishing it, and as a result I couldn't order more. I even asked the waitress if I could go on my own separate bill, to which they said, "One table, one bill".

They wasted a ton of food that night, and I was probably the only person in the history of an "all you can eat" restaurant who went home hungry.
250g doesn't sound like a particularly big meal for those 180 people

In general,  the solution would be to switch to smaller plates. People are lazy and they will avoid doing many trips to the bar. 
That is the ugliest number 5 I've ever seen. 
Fuck I'm tired. I originally saw wastage and thought that this was written in German or something 
However, that wouldnt have actually fed anyone. It instead saves the company money and gives them more profit. They are playing on your emotions for their gain.

Im a little cranky this morning apparently lol.
[In other words: Don't do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCLXZmMQNs)
i know some all you can eat places get around this by charging a fee if your plate isnt empty when you ask for the bill. which i think is perfectly acceptable, wasting food is a shame. 

edit: to the people whining, or saying what if i have 1 shrimp on my plate, use some common sense people. if you have a few small items, or stuff half eaten cause you didn't like it you wont be charged normally. it's the people who've had 3 plates are pretty full but think they can do one more round fill a plate and leave it half full. 

and to the people saying how do they charge you for it? well buffets are a set price, when your bill comes there will be a fee on top, it's not rocket science.. 
I wonder if this is 100% actual foods that you could have actually fed 180 people with or if they just weighed the waste bin... 
It's ironic this is a sign at Tata. Fuck this company and everything it stands for.
But is it gonna feed 180 people, if it wasn't wasted? What are they gonna do with leftovers at the end of the day?
A retaurant in my town makes you pay double if they see you wasting too much food. If you don't pay, they kick you out. Not like we would waste anything on the first place, but there will always be assholes.
We did a similar thing when I went to school. The cafeteria had a clear tube that red balls were placed in for every x kilo thrown in the waste baskets. There was also a mark on the tube, and if we were lower than the mark by the end of the year, everyone would get ice cream.
Do they weigh just the edible waste or are they including bones and shells?  If the former, who's separating these?  
They should also post their profit for full transparency
TCS...   the sweatshop of the consultancy world...
Buffet by definition is wasteful, they can take their side order of guilt and shove it. 
I wonder how effective this sign is...
I love the "do it for the environment" or "do it for starving people" marketing...when it is really "do it so that we can reduce our costs".  Same with "reuse your towel" signs in hotels.

I saw a guy build an entire driveway out of hash, so this resin table isn't that impressive to me.
Travertine is travertine, not marble.
Oh, my shins!
Based on similar projects I'm seeing on DIY, it looks like the process is basically: put pieces of wood (or stone?) into watertight mold or tape off parts, pour resin, let resin dry, sand, seal. https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2d6fms/resin_inlaid_chestnut_shelves/
Edit: to clarify, it was wood.

Now that is one beautiful table. Good looking and a thing you could live with too.
imagine bumping into that thing with your shin
There should be a law that all furniture at shin level must have rounded corners.
Travertine can be marble?  I thought travertine was a limestone.
I would design my house around that table!
No uncharted fans here? Any time someone mentions Resin, I'm thinking that there's a hidden treasure map nearby. 
So is it travertine or marble?
how "gripy" is resin? like if you were to try to slide a glass across the table would it grip to the table?
What kind of resin is that? 

I need to know. For reasons. Please.
This is a lot like Greg Klassen's tables in wood and glass. I think Klassen's work is, overall, nicer looking though. It also involves more work to cut the glass to match the curves:

http://gregklassen.com/collection/river/

There are some other artists who do this too, whose names escape me at the moment, including at least one who does it with thicker pieces of glass, 3D shaped along the entire thickness of the table.
Kindof ugly. Looks like a tie-dyed tshirt with coffee stains on it stuffed into a glass box. but hey, if you like it you like it I guess.

I lived in South Africa for years. There is almost zero chance these are "commuters". This is almost certainly inside a park, and those cars are tourists specifically there looking for lions and other wildlife. Look at all the cameras. Lions don't just wander around Africa. They are very rare and highly prized tourist attractions, and they're in very specific, fenced (but extremely large, think hundreds, or even thousands of square miles) areas.

Africa is not huts and wildlife. Africa has cell phones and shopping malls and McDonalds and Adam Sandler movies, same as everywhere else.
Nice BALLS
Must not have been any dentists near the front of the line
Nairobi is the only city in the world to have a national park right next to the city. People who live close to the park have at times encountered cheetahs and hyenas when coming back home from a night out. So yeah, lions can sometimes show up outside the park. But it isn't a common occurrence, though. 
TIL Nairobi drivers need laser pointers. 
Fucking cats man ... They do whatever they want and dont care who they inconvenience. Place a potted plant on a table in the middle of the Savannah with nothing around it for miles and you bet your ass a fucking lion will show up and knock it over.

> Its hard not to smile back at this grinning guy. But dont let that goofy smile fool you. This species is omnivorous and will eat just about anything it can get its jaws on, including carrion. People have even watched groups of these turtles snag and drown doves and other relatively large prey, dragging them to the depths of the pond to dine. They look cute, but theyre stone cold killers.

Just a friendly advice, stay away from fallen trees. Here in sweden it's called a 'rotvälta', and you NEVER know when a fallen tree decides to snap/break and swing the stump with all it's roots back up to the original place.

 Even more dangerous to be in the hole of where it once stood. Every time there's a big storm here in Sweden, someone gets hurt really bad/dies because of this.

Beautiful, I once worked as a logger deep in the northern California mountains. I saw bears every day, once I walked up on a bear and her cub. They looked at me, began breathing heavily and grunting. I slowly pulled out my clipboard and shut it fast creating a loud snap. They ran off. I use to see them in trees. Beautiful animals that aren't nearly as vicious as people think.
This bear, knows how to party. 

Edit: removed California because redditor pointed out a fact

It'd be funny if she purposely omitted an ingredient so that anybody else's cookies won't be as good as mom's.

This has been posted before, and iirc a redditor made the cookies.  But I can't find the post.  [I did find an article that provides some background about the woman and her recipe.](http://www.thegazette.com/2012/12/24/family-cookie-recipe-stands-the-test-of-time)

Oleo is Margarine. They used to call it oleo margarine. Many, many years ago margarine was white and it came with a packet of yellow dye to kneed into the margarine. The butter industry didn't want it to look yellow. Margarine came out during the depression, I think.
Oleo.... saved $50 per letter than if they used margarine.

Thats some "Colour out of Space" shit.
Just think, when Yellowstone eventually erupts, a massive section of the United States and Canada will look like this. Probably even worse.

Volcanos, you crazy. 
Unedited? I can tell you with full confidence as a photographer/photo editor that the color saturation on the aid workers was increased and the rest decreased to add a more dramatic effect. You can even see little bits of brown around the photo that were left to make it seem unedited but seem oddly out of place. Examples are the headless statue and surrounding area, materiel hanging out the window, little spot of brown on the far right down slope. Sorry about the rant, I just get annoyed when people post "stunning" photos that clearly didn't look anything like that when they were taken. Especially when it says "unedited" in the title.
With the color taken away, it almost looks fake... eerie.
At first I was like "Yes unedited, except for the color isolation..." then I was like "Holy giraffe testicles!"
As of this morning, 51 people confirmed dead.  12 people still missing.  

The typhoon that hit yesterday will certainly hinder finding the remaining 12.

Just an interesting tidbit: most non-venomous snakes have round eyes while most venomous snakes have "cat" eyes. There is one exception that I know of in the U.S., that being the coral snake which has round eyes. 

As pointed out by u/pozzessed, this is not true globally. My experience is local to the southeast U.S. Turns out that some of the most deadly snakes in the world have round pupils.

When I was a child I thought that the Morton Salt building was just filled to the brim with salt, and as I grew older I realized how stupid that idea was. Now I don't know what to believe anymore.
Context: [Salt poured out of the side of the Morton Salt plant along the Kennedy Expy. in West Town after a side wall collapsed Tuesday afternoon, burying a neighboring Acura dealer's cars.](http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20141230/river-west/morton-salt-plant-wall-collapses-pouring-salt-on-acura-dealership-cars)
Was salt just piled up against that wall there or was it contained in something else. This doesn't seem right.
That's only about enough for a five pack of Ramen.
So much salt needs to be thrown over someone's shoulder. 
Some prankster left the side of the building unscrewed. Classic.

Oh my, $20 worth of salt gone to waste!
Morton's salt owns the world of salt because of a proprietary method of forming NaCl under pressure in a chamber.  This causes each and every crystal to be 100% uniform, which doesn't seem like a big deal until you try to shake some out of a shaker.

Mark Kurlaskey's SALT: A WORLD HISTORY is a fantastic read~
I'd like to see the video from the camera on the corner of that building there.

A salty surprise
**Insurance adjuster**: "How did you say your car was damaged?" 

**Owner**: "Well, it was a-salted..."
How long before every stray animal in the immediate area comes and begins licking the salt pile?
Will that show up on the car fax?

It's not real wood. It's cement and/or plaster sculpted to look like wood.  It's part of the Disney's Animal Kingdom exhibit directly in front of the "Tree of Life" (which is a fake tree) that has a whole bunch of other animals sculpted into it.
fake wood
crazy how nature make dat
The finger in the corner of this picture is really bugging me...

Fake tree and finger is in the pic. Get it together OP
I know it's been said before, but this isn't real wood.  This is a decoration at Animal Kingdom in Orlando, I'm pretty sure it's plastic or fiberglass.
Isn't this just at Disney World?

That horse has like... 10 horsepower.
Fuck me if I ever find a duck that size.
That is a BIG horse! Is this a mutation or a certain type of horse?
It helps that it was part Stegosaurus. 
It's really just a regular Brooklyn with sour cream and guacamole. 
So his cock should be the size of that man? I feel so sorry for the mare he wants to breed with.

Brooklyn Supreme is NOT the world's biggest horse!

The "biggest" horse on record is Sampson, a Shire horse 21.2 hands high by the time he was a four year old, when he was re-named Mammoth. His peak weight was estimated at 3,360 lb.  He was born in 1846, before Brooklyn was ever born.

Brooklyn "only" stood 19.2 hands high.  

The record-holder for "biggest horse" as of 2007 was a Shire horse named Tina who was 20 hands high.  Tina died in 2008 and was subsequently beaten by Big Jake, who is 20 hands *plus two and three-quarter inches* and still alive, holding the current record.  Big Jake weighs only 2,600 pounds compared to Sampson, but Guinness no longer records "biggest" by weight, but by height, so although Jake is much trimmer than either Brooklyn or Sampson, he still holds the title.

Edit: a "hand" is 4 inches.

That horse never skipped leg day. Or any day.
Beautiful horse, horrible feet. His toe is so long, Id imagine he had a hard time moving especially considering his massive size. Imagine trying to walk with swimming flippers on your feet all day long!
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

Ev'ry morning to help me get large

And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs

So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

Now that's a horse fit for Lu Bu

Little bit about the photo.   I live in the remote fly in community called Pangnirtung in Canada's High Arctic. 
Between sunrise and sunset we have only 2 .5 hours of light. (Not all usable). around 1pm a jumped on my skidoo along with my friend Markus and we drove 45min up to the top of a nearby mountain where the light ( which is almost always pink near the solstice ) would hit the hills. Prepared with multiple thermos filled with tea we began tossing the water and shooting. Nothing of this shot was to chance i followed the temperature, i watched for calm wind,  planned the shot and set it up. even the sun in the middle of the spray was something i was hoping for (even though its was impossible to control). So thats it ask away if you have questions. feel free to stop by my website www.michaelhdavies.com or my flickr page https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelhdavies/

Probably the most insane logistical and engineering undertaking in history.
an interesting thing about d day is the germans blew up all the docks and the allies anticipated this and build a floating dock that they could boat up to the beach which then served as a unloading point for all their shit... and the germans blew up their shit and the allies sailed their dock in and everything went way easier for the unloading process... it was called mulberry and when i saw this on the history channel the guy said it was one of the most innovative things about the invasion

In *The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant*, which may be the finest memoirs ever by a U.S. President, Grant devotes many chapters to the Mexican-American War and the U.S. Civil War. This is no surprise. However, to those unfamiliar with the text, it often comes as a surprise how much attention Grant devotes to *logistics*.  In popular imagining, new technologies like machine guns were decisive in the Civil War, but from the point of view of America's top general, such things weren't even worth mentioning. Victory resulted from being able to move his cannons and food to where he wanted them to be.

"Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking."


Eisenhower had this printed and given out to every person in the invasion.

This is an incredible and amazing photo.  Reading about the landings and that day and the horror of just the one battle, it's a mind blowing thought to me that as safe as these particular soldiers must have felt, they were just getting started with the war.

I can't comprehend how mentally taxing battle must have been.  If you survive, you know there's more coming.  
Where are all those metal things that you usually see in movies depicting D-day. I think they're called hedgehogs? I thought they were there to prevent lots of vehicles landing on the beach. 
"You know those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got? Well, they've got them!"
In Stephen Ambrose's book "D-Day," which I highly recommend, he compares the D-Day landings to taking every man, woman, child, vehicle, and supply in Green Bay, Wisconsineverything in the entire city not bolted downand moving it across Lake Michigan in 24 hours while under constant fire.

Something tells me no one fucks with Minnie May.
First thing I noticed: the design of the "Premium" brand saltine cracker box hasn't changed in 57 years. 
What's crazy is that Minnie Mae outlived pretty much all of her family--Elvis,  Vernon, they all died before her. 
Dang, if you need a wikipedia image for "withering stare" this pic will probably do the trick.
That haircut isn't regulation at all...but it should be.
His dad looks like the T-1000 traveled back and ate too many peanut butter banana sandwiches
> **milk**

Concise and accurate. Excellent marketing.
If anyone is wondering what patch he is wearing, it's the patch of the 3rd Armored Division(Tank Division)
Interesting that Minnie has a hairstyle suited to the 20s and 30s. Kinda like our grandma's nowadays have hairstyles from the 50s and 60s. 
Man, Elvis was a damn stud.
Elvis is the coolest motherfucker there ever was. His dad looks like a bad ass too, and grandma looks like she's gonna whup the photographer's ass for taking pictures at the dinner table. 
Minnie Mae straight out of American Gothic
the wrong kid died!
I miss the way foods were labeled in the 50s. What it was was more important than who made it. A tin of black pepper. A carton of milk. A box of... premiums.
Pretty sure that's Ray Liotta 
Elvis guy here.

What strikes me is how modest the setting here is.  At this point Elvis was the biggest name in the world, with multiple #1 records and hit movies. He was already a pioneer in music (with several "first" concept albums already done) and basically the most famous entertainer in the world.

By 1959, Elvis beloved mama was dead and Vernon had already remarried (a woman who quickly asserted herself as the new matriarch of the family, much to Elvis' displeasure. She and Vernon lived in GRaceland with Elvis for a time but after she rearranged the furniture and changed the drapes, which Gladys had picked out, Elvis moved all her stuff out and sent her down the road to live with Vernon in a nearby house).


It's unclear to me where this picture was taken but it doesn't appear to be Graceland. The house changed a lot between 57-77 but this doesn't look anything I've seen. It may be Vernonshouse.

The point is, despite already having an obscene amount of money and a willingness to spend it freely on his loved ones, the  environment here is still so modest. It's partially because of the era and partially because. Elvis' family grew up so dirt poor that even this was considered a significant step up.
Christ he's photogenic isn't he?
Her head looks way too small for her body. She's on the same level as the Koopas in the Mario Bros movie.
Was this before or after he stole his iconic dance off Forrest Gump?
I bet you that was a damn good breakfast too. 
Oh, Minnie... You so fine, you so fine you blow my mind.
Wow, Vernon looks just like [Robert Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Patrick) who played Johnny Cashs father in Walk the Line.
TIL Nabisco hasn't changed the packaging of their saltine crackers in half a century.
Thought it said his dad's name was "Venom".  Damn.  Greasers were hardcore.
Is Minnie Mae the inspiration behind "Drag Me to Hell"?

Nice OC OP, this will be stolen and reposted for years to come!
The big one in the middle is from a 2 year old hen but the others are all about 7 months old. 
Oh man I want to like add this as a photo on my wall, I'm obsessed with the color palette. 
Are you breeding Chocobos?
This is a recent dozen from our three hens, all the same breed. I love the variation :)  http://i.imgur.com/7NTUazq.jpg 
The Chaos Eggmeralds!

.......

I'll show myself out.
> Seven. Seven hued shells, and the rooster will become a god.
Each one has a different power-up right?
[For anyone curious](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/why_are_chicken_eggs_different_colors) about why chicken eggs come in different colors. Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

>All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hens oviduct. The journey through the chickens oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg.
Wow, it's a very artistic photograph :D
Could you possibly post a picture of each hen showing which egg is hers? That would be cool to see.
Banjo Kazooie!

I've seen every single one of those from my mother's hens. 

I believe the small white ones are Bantams, the large blue ones are Legbars, then there's the ones I don't know the breed of.
SHENRON! I summon thy hen !!
This looks like it could be the cover of Martha Stewart Living
The fact that you raised your own hens and that they produce these cool-as-hell eggs makes me like you even more.
"One egg to rule them all,

one egg to find them,

One egg to bring them all

and in the skillet fry them."
Which breeds produce each color?
How do hens react to people taking their eggs? Are they just ok with it because they're chickens and...yea that's it? 
This is such a simple picture but I feel like it's educational and really fucking cool. I'm happy I looked at this.
So cool. I remember the first time I saw a green egg! I was ecstatic 
http://i.imgur.com/9DALOyT.jpg
  
I've raised almost half a dozen of my own from chicks and they started laying a few weeks ago. The white one was laid by an older leghorn that is a good bit older than the others but the other three are the most variation that I've received from the younger ones. I'm looking forward to getting a blue one soon.
The one at the bottom contains a remote controlled kazooie-shaped bomb if I remember right

That shit is fucked up. My wife bought some of that Fabuloso and I nearly poured myself a glass while wondering why she bought the Mexican brand. 
Looks just as tasty tho ... doesn't it ? 

*Seriously this is a poisoning just waiting to happen*
The first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
I'm guessing an employee opened a box on the receiving dock and assumed this was juice so they put it in the juice aisle, I doubt this was intentional. Though it is a huge and dangerous mistake.  It's like the time someone found "Gun Oil" in the gun section of a walmart in the south somewhere.  Gun Oil is lube marketed towards gay men for anal sex.  But the employee assumed, based on what it looks like, that it belongs in the actual gun section.
The fabuloso probably tastes better. And is also likely more than 10% juice. 
https://i.imgur.com/CXQecet.png
Fabuloso is more to blame for making their cleaner look like some sort of juice/soda.
Terrible.  Just terrible.  Welch's is disgusting.
I am a paramedic. I have been on this exact call. With this exact product. Guy bought the one with apples on it, thought is was apple juice. Was real thirsty, didn't  realize it till he finished the whole glass... He was fine and ended up AMAing 
Tastes like dying!
My dad has a lot of eye problems and can't read without his glasses and barely can even then.  I can just imagine him or another hapless old timer picking this up and dying alone later when they down a glass of it wondering why it tastes funny but thinking their sense of taste must be going too.

It's not even fucking striped!!!
What the fuck is juice? I want that grape drink baby.
That is a serious violation. 
Hello, lawsuit.
When I read the title I was like "Oh come on. No one is going to think it's juice".

Then I looked at the picture and my thought process was "Okay there's the juice to the left and on the right must be the cleaner... wait Welch makes juice... oh god"
Ugh, I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally drank Welch's Cleaning Juice
You know the old adage. "Never trust a product whose price can't easily be rounded to the nearest dollar in increments of $0.05."
I can just imagine a busy parent rushing through the store telling their child to go grab some juice and the child getting a bottle of cleaner. I doubt a parent in a hurry would even notice until they got home... It is completely awful to stock shelves in that manner. 
How is this legal?

I used to work at Best Buy years ago when a little kid comes up with an Xbox and a bag of coins. I was frustrated at first until he looks up at me and says "I've been saving my allowance and helping neighbors all year to buy this." The mother gave me this really apologetic look and says he insisted he pay for it with the money he earned. Was just too cute for me to be angry.
As a previous employee of Best Buy, I'm familiar with this type of customer, and there's one thing I can promise you: he complained about how long it took to check out.
As a jew this is a little awkward
Dont know about the States but in Canada you can refuse payment like that. Anything more than 27 coins I believe.
That's a lot of broken parking meters
the guy couldn't have gone to a bank beforehand to exchange the quarters for cash??? what a prick. poor craig robinson...
This is what those of us who have cashiered refer to as "The Baggy".

The customer approaches you with their purchase(es), perhaps wearing a slight smile and greeting you kindly. You ring up their items, exchanging in some well-worn small talk that you have used over and over again for the past few hours. When you inform the customer of their total, the customer suddenly says, "I hope you don't mind change."

And there it is. Before then it had only been heard of in legend, mentioned in the tales of other more seasoned cashiers that have seen every horror of the job. You had scoffed at it then--how badly could a baggy be, after all? But then you see it yourself, unable to help yourself from cringing at the sound of the weight of coinage being dropped upon your counter. You look from The Baggy to the total, and then to the line of customers gathering behind The Baggy Holder.

You realize that you cannot be defeated. Not by this. Certainly not by a pile of coins and the piece of plastic that contains them. You must endure so that one day you are able to tell this tale in hopes to warn another unfortunate soul about the existance of The Baggy.

You open The Baggy with trembling hands and begin the count...
the stereotype lives on.
Used to work at a movie theater.  Teens would come in and ask to see an R rated movie they were clearly not old enough to see and dump a bag of pennies on my counter and giggle.  So I'd count them.  Slowly.  Purposefully.  They'd begin to get impatient (2 minutes before the movie, hurry up!)  Then I'd "lose" count.  Gotta start again.  Finally they would just stand there and fume.  I'd finish, let them know they had enough, then ask for ID.  None of them even bothered to try to bring a fake one.  Booted them out.

Give me pennies, prepare to wait mofo's.
The guy counting the quarters is probably thinking *"what the fuck am I doing with my life"*
he should have paid with the gold he keeps hidden in a bag around his neck.
As a person who works in retail, fuck people like this. This has happened so many times at my store that my manager has told me I don't have to accept large payments that are made with change. Seriously is it so hard to go to the bank and get bills?
That is a total dick move. I get if you are proud that you saved up enough quarters to buy an iPod, but stop by the fucking bank first and cash that shit in. Don't make the poor sales guy deal with that shit. 
Illegal to do that in Canada. You're only allowed to use quarters for purchases up to $10.

** (2) A payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:
(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and
(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

What a douche bag. 
When I was a bank teller a common customer came in with fucking $600 of unsorted change. I tried to explain to him that a branch just 2 miles away had a change sorting machine but we didn't. 

I was also the only teller working for that 2 hours, which is about how long it took me. He also told me that he had counted and I was off by $30. 

I almost quit right there. 
... He actually looks like the kind of guy who owns a small, yet successful, chain of laundromats and a handful of vending machines.

Of course, that same look applies to a great number of private investigators as well.  They just usually don't have the quarters like this guy does.

(Polo shirt, not quite physically fit, constantly on phone or internet so as to keep things moving in the business).
This guy is being a jerk. He's a grown ass man who could easily go to bank to get his coins counted up and pay with bills.  And yet here he is on his smart phone wasting his and everyone's time.
Why did he have to be wearing a kippah? We've come so far. And now we're back at square one.

Oy vey.
I know this is never going to get read, but all comments regarding the Jewish stereotype and poor retail worker aside this really reflects poorly on the management.  If I was a supervisor at this Best Buy and I saw this going on I would have pulled this man aside and counted the quarters myself, in an office, while I would have my cashier service other customers.  Just because you have an inconsiderate customer doesn't mean that you should let your other customers and your employees suffer.  
Simply tell them "We are not a bank"
and the best buy guy should have taken the extra few minutes and sifted through the  quarters for silver. there was no doubt probably 15-30 silver quarters. tell your boss you need change and swap out a $20 for the silver quarters. would have made the counting of  quarters worth it.
While I was in college, a grad student across the hall from me saved up his change from the time he was like 12.  

He bought a 56" flatscreen with it.  About $2000, all in a giant crayon that weighed probably 200 lbs.  

The Best Buy crew had to count it out at customer service.  Took about three hours.
When I was a Supervisor at Best Buy I'd happily go grab the change counter from Ops room and use it count that shit.

Those types of customer are either looking for an argument or think that putting some minimum wage high school kid through the wringer is *fun*. Taking away their fun is the only way to win.
Assuming he bought a 16 GB iPad Mini at $329, with tax comes out to roughly $350. This is about 1400 quarters. If the cashier counted the quarters for 15 minutes, he counted about 93 quarters every minute, which is 3 quarters every 2 seconds.  
I don't know why I wanted to do that math.

Then you realize it's for cooking, cleaning and bathing too. 
I was without water for about a week when my water lines were destroyed in a hurricane.

Fun story. I lived in Detroit for a summer in a house with no pipes and no electricity. It had been completely gutted. So no water, no working toilets, etc. It was pretty crazy but I grew up poor so it didn't feel as bad to me as it would for other people.

Background: my dad bought this house for hella cheap and moved out there. He knew what he was getting himself into and had plans to just rough it while he saved up to have the pipes re-installed, toilets and sinks and faucets replaced and get everything in working order. That never happened though. Life throws curve balls at us all the time. 

The summer of 2010, I went to stay with him since it was summer vacation from college. 

There was a lot of craftiness involved in living there. Being on my period was the worst. 

My brother (also lived there) and I would walk to the local library and brush our teeth there. We would stay from open until about 3 or 4pm and read and charge our phones. We were also able to use flushing toilets there. At home, we shat in plastic bags and then threw them away outside (tmi?) 

We were also able to get gallons of water at the store to bathe with. We would put water in little tin things (like for cooking bbq and stuff) and then use bar soap. We weren't the cleanest people but we weren't hella funky either.

My dad did splurge once when I was on my period and got me a room in a hotel so I could clean up properly. I was also able to wash my hair at the hotel which was nice. 

We didn't have electricity either. My dad and I slept on the floor in his room (brother was upstairs) and one day we went to RadioShack and bought a crank radio. We would listen to our favorite radio show at night. It was really nice. The sun set pretty late so we had a good amount of daylight to get stuff done. Whenever I would get home from the library, I would usually write or draw.

We ate a lot of fruit and bread and random snacks because we couldn't cook. My dad and brother also ate canned meats. 

It was a summer I'll never forget. It was actually one of my favorite summers in spite of everything. I knew that when I went back to school, I was going to miss Detroit. It's not the friendliest city in the world but for some reason the part I was in (the east side) felt kind of like the country to me. Things felt slower, homier, more neighbohood-y. It's hard to explain. But as much shit as people have to say about Detroit, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Most people don't know I've lived like this and wouldn't expect it. I'm kind of prim and proper at times and I'm about to get a master's degree. People with master's degrees don't shit in plastic bags!
Gm refused to use it because it was corroding car parts...people expect flint residents to bathe in it?


Hhmm make it black and white and we are back to 1940 
Maybe this is why we think old pictures looks so different. Because these are the photos that make it to the future. People in 2060 are going to think the same thing we're thinking now!
Is this for showers, dish washing etc. as well?
Stop commenting how much water that is for drinking. 

You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. That's a quarter bottle, per person, at least. You make your coffee. Two bottles. You drink it and wash your cup. That's at least a bottle of water to do that. Of course if you ate breakfast and your family ate too, you have to wash those, so bet on 10 bottles to do your dishes. You can take a shower, but the water is sort of blue today, which means the copper hasn't cleared the lines, and you broke out yesterday, so you just wipe up with a washrag. That's half a bottle. Per person. Minimum. If you need to wash your hair, that's an an additional 2-5 bottles, if you have long hair. 

You need to wipe down the counters, but you don't want to wipe lead onto them, so you use bottled water to clean up with, that's a bottle or 2. You water the dog, 2 bottles. THroughout all this, you've probably been sipping on a water bottle. 

You make spaghetti for dinner, that means 4 bottles for water for cooking, plus 10-12 bottles to wash out that many greasy pots and pans and rinse them, and you still have to wash everyone up for bed and get their teeth brushed, which is at least another three quarters of a bottle per person. 

Stop thinking of it as the drinking water allowance for the day. It's the only clean, safe, usable water in your home that can be used for anything but flushing your toilet, for the next 24 hours. 
Is that just *their* allowance or for the whole family? And wouldn't it be more efficient to distribute the water in gallon jugs?

Shit is fucking shameful.  
Pardon my language and this isn't meant personally toward anyone but as someone from Flint, MI I say this:  Fuck off with using us as "the state of America" and all that.  Every 10 years we end up in the news for some "look how the system has failed" story and every time people act like they finally realize something needs to change.  None of you care in the bigger picture of it all.  A year or more down the road and you will have forgotten all about this and Flint will still be decayed and run down and left a shell of a city.  As shitty as this current situation is, it's been within a hair of this for DECADES.  This is just an interesting headline to the rest of the nation until it isn't any more.
I apologize if this is not the appropriate place to post this, but I feel it may be useful since it's a highly visible post right now.

We are a band from Flint, MI (I currently live right downtown) called Sprowt.

Several bands, some from Flint and some outside of Flint, have contributed music to a $5 compilation album organized by Jonathan Diener (of The Swellers). 

100% of the proceeds are being donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint's Flint Child Health & Development Fund (flintkids.org).

If you're a music fan, please feel free to donate by buying the Not Safe To Drink: Music For Flint Water Crisis Relief compilation album at:

https://notsafetodrink.bandcamp.com/

The compilation album will be available on February 20th, 2016.

Thank you to everyone taking notice and doing something to help.

Put quite frankly, this whole thing sucks.
Where can I donate?
I can't imagine what I'd do if my kids had been permanently poisoned with lead. I'd go on a rampage.
Flint is a disaster.  There's literally no quick fix and one that won't cost a huge amount of money.  Flint needs to be condemned and the residents should have their homes bought out at a fair market price before the crisis occurred.  100,000 residents + a quick google search showing that the average house price ~$100k = $10bn to buy out Flint. Probably a bit more than that, but in the ball park.  Shit, we spend way more to drop bombs on people in foreign lands every year.  I'm sure we can help 100,000 Americans out.

What are we talking- $40 each?  $50 maybe?
The sanding...oh god, the sanding...
TIL: *Brown Oak is technically not a distinct species of oak, but rather refers to oak (almost always English Oak or another European species) that has been infected with a fungus. This fungus (Fistulina hepatica) has the effect of turning the wood a deep brown color. Once the wood has been cut and dried, the fungus dies, leaving a rich golden brown lumber.*

English Oak (assuming that's what this is) looks to have tighter grain than the Red Oak I'm used to in Virginia.
That's awesome.  What's to keep it from drying out and cracking in half 5 years from now?

That is a seat fit for an Archdruid

Such a perfect stump,

and it's almost enough stump

Stunning work of art, it belongs in a museum.  What a gifted craftsman.
It's beautiful but somehow repulsive.
The craftsman that made this chair was 78 years old. It was the last piece of furniture his boss Tom told him to make. It took him a year and a half to complete.

 As he worked his hands hurt and he felt tired. At times he wanted to cut corners and go home early. But did he? No, he worked harder and more diligently than ever. The sweat boiled from his face as he toiled. Final he was done.

 He showed the chair to his boss the next morning. "Jim this is the finest work you have ever done." His boss was very pleased. "Why did you work on it so hard Jim?"

 "Because the customer who buys this will live with it for a lifetime." "Through good times and bad, through all the seasons and all Hollidays. Memories will be made. Memories maybe I didn't get to make myself." 

Tom looks at Jim and with a tear in his eye and says "The chair is yours Jim." "The chair is yours Jim....." 
"It didn't take that long, considering I carved all by hand and from a single piece of wood."
That is a lot of work on a very unstable piece of wood. I hope it's kept in a very stable environment.
I suppose everyone has different tastes, but this is butt ugly to me.  Tremendous amount of work and considerable skill displayed, but not something I'd have.
The sanding...oh god, the sanding...
Ron Swanson would be proud... though he could have done that in one evening after drinking a pint of whiskey.
TRUMP 2016!!!

Please downvote me!!!
Sorry but it reminds me of the nails of the guy who holds the guiness world record for the longest nails.
That's glorious!  Thank you for sharing!
I was also carved from an oak stump. 
Excellent showcase of skill.
I once made a pinewood derby car.

From a kit.
Gorgeous work. Thanks for sharing. I don't know why some are so worried about how big or comfortable it would be. 
Pretty amazing when you consider it's carved out of one piece of wood.
My friend Alex made this! Unbelievably he doesn't have a website, but here's an article about it with some more pics!

Anyone have a 'before' pic of the same location?
The worst part of looking at this picture is knowing a couple years ago I was walking down the roads of that city with family and now knowing I will never be able to do that again.. 
how do you even start to rebuild? Where do the funds come from? I just cant wrap my head around it. You see the same images from the World wars. Is this just the edge of the city or one part and behind is miles of a functioning city? Or is it seriously one big pile of rubble. 

edit. a word
I didn't know it snowed in Syria.
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ELAa02TUY) some quality footage from a Russian drone showing the massive destruction in these cities, ignore the biased title (not that it is entirely incorrect, but that's a separate argument).  

edit - [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYnxbjyxFtY) some footage of what caused a lot of the destruction - not the same city but this tactic has been used by the regime throughout Syria.  
It's so sad to think of the millions of hours of work to get a city developed to that level only to be destroyed in a hundredth of that time... I can picture little kids playing, families eating together, and overall happiness being there at some point. Now it's all gone... 
Pic looks like it could be from WWII...

War. War never changes.
I don't envy the refugees.  If they stayed, they would have been slaughtered, or make a perilous journey to places that don't like them, and don't trust them.
"Yea! Why don't the refugees stay there and try to improve their country?" /s
This is what causes a refugee crisis.

My family lives in Homs. They have been suffering for over 4 years, and it breaks my heart that they are still suffering. They have lost all hope in receiving help against Assad. If only you guys could hear the lack of life in their voices. 
This is just crazy.. I have a hard time wrapping my head around this.. To think its going on not to far away is mind boggling. We got it good guys, we got it real good
The question is who bomb the shit out of it?
This is why people are fleeing Syria. There's nowhere to go home to.
[deleted]
It is just disgusting :( the entire country has been destroyed.  
I think its sad mist of these people are in some tent in Turkey or Jordan.

 Few if the fortunate gave risked it to cross to Europe (Many of which dont make it).

It's hardly a warm welcome they're getting too
I totally didn't expect to see a picture of my city in the front page of Reddit, this made me tear up. Homs is the third largest city in Syria in population, and the first one in area, the district of Homs is four times the size of Lebanon. The reason that Homs turned into this mess is the huge religious and sectarian diversity, but mainly Sunnis, Alawites, and Christians. If you look at the sect or religion of neighborhoods in or near the city of Homs, you would understand why the civil war in reality began in Homs. The vast majority of Christians moved out of the city to the surrounding Christian villages, most of the Sunni neighborhoods were leveled to the ground (check jouret shayah on Google), as for Alawites, they were able to stay in the city as a the result of the huge government support and the fact that there are tens of thousands of them living in Homs. Pretty much all of Syria will sooner or later be like Homs since all countries are showing off their military capabilities in my country. 
And people suggest that the refugees go back. Look at this photo and tell me they have something to go back to.
That used to be a home. :-(
Looks like Stalingrad.
Syria before and after photos.

How is there no snow on the top of the handrail?
I was staring at this for like 10 minutes thinking "wtf, why would you Photoshop a gate onto white space? Does he live in an apartment building and own the railing on the stairs? Seriously, wtf?"
I took the photo...

It's my yard. South St. Louis City.

So....there ya go.

Fake.  

1.  The shadows aren't right for a white out.  (There's multiple shadows for the rails).

2.  No remnants of snow on the hand rail of the bottom of the rails.

3.  The step protruding out doesn't even show tiny snow flakes.  It's a solid white line.

Soooo this picture was taken by my friend, not me. I thought it looked cool and figured I'd share it since he's not a redditor... Its gotten so many views now i feel like such a karma whore. I don't want any misconceptions I did not take this photo.  I want him to get all real life credit for the picture that he is due.  He's told me he is happy for the exposure and I've asked him to make an account, if he does I'll be sure to point you in the right direction.

That's actually a theater for trees.

The last movies i saw at a drive in were a double feature of Mortal Kombat and Water World. 
A settlement needs your help!
Nobody knows, but the screen randomly plays scenes from your life until it gets to your death. Then boop you dead

Clear the radioactive waste and start building your settlement!
Drive-ins that are out in the sticks are the best ones.  There is something about being out in the country watching a movie on a giant screen that is like nothing else in the world.

I bet a lot of people had a great deal of fun at that drive-in.
First thing I thought looking at that is WiFi signal bars..
I love seeing nature take back its land.
I remember watching the movie Twister at the drive-in up north MI cherry bowl. So many memories going up there each summer.
I wonder how many people were conceived there.
I find it interesting that the only place the forest made inroads is right up by the screen.  My guess is that the fanned out area where cars used to park to see the movie is somewhat contaminated from oil and exhaust from cars, making that ground less fertile.  In fact, I see that bushes are growing in the car-park area, but in distinct lines, probably where cars didn't park or drive.

Where is this??
The last movie I saw at a drive in was a double feature. Free Willy, and The Fugitive. 
Man I remember going to these :\

I first saw MI2 at a drive in.
This is some post apocalyptic Revolution or Walking Dead style reclamation from civilization.

I'm more amazed by all the untouched forest. It's nice.

I don't understand how wood that thin would be strong enough, especially with all of those things attached to it. I understand it is a render but they must have thought about how they would practically make this when designing it. Would love to see a real one.

Hey, mate. I don't want to burst your bubble, but the word "clients" just made me have to log in and post this. Please don't tell me you're charging people for photography of this quality. If you are just mucking around and taking photos for friends, that's fine (and I hope you're enjoying yourself!). But you should not be allowing people to put faith in you (and give you probably large sums of money) to document what might be the biggest event in their life when you are clearly not qualified to perform this work.

If you can look past the god-awful quality/sharpness/resolution of the image (are you using consumer gear or a point and shoot?) and even further past the basic compositional errors (have you ever studied any other wedding photography before?) the photos still don't appear to have any of effort put into colour correction, cropping, lens issue correction, or any other kind of post production.

You should be less concerned about slipping in "clever" reflections, and actually focus on learning how to use a camera. You are far, far from the point where you should be watermarking your images and calling yourself a professional.

Sorry, I hope I wasn't too mean. I just can't hack it when people like you shit all over the profession that some of us have sunk decades into.

edit: and if you have been doing it for decades...my condolences.

Thanks for David Johnson!
Fellow native Iowan here, glad to see my home state on the front page for some reason other than the primaries...
This is why you can't say *all* of the education system in America is bad.
UNI is great - I just finished up my first year, and I love it. From the administration to students, it feels very tight-knit. I have the opportunity to work with administrators, and they genuinely care about students. Once in a while the president (Bill Ruud, at the left podium) will just wander around the union and talk to people, he invited student government to his house. A couple weeks ago the Provost (Jim Wohlpart, on the right podium) came to one of the student senate meetings, and we had a great discussion with him. 

And he signs his emails with an interesting signature, "Awe & Wonder".

ITT: Iowans getting stoked about finding other Iowans on Reddit.

Note: I too am from Iowa. I've been in the UNIdome many times. 

Honestly that really considerate of them.

At my graduation the women's lacrosse team was away at some championship game and came two hours late, and the faculty tried to make everyone stay. People were getting restless and tried to leave but they would get up and tell the students that it was mandatory to stay. 

Eventually they got there, instead of lining up and getting their diplomas they wanted their names called one by one so they could make a grand entrance and high-five people. They got booed instantly.
Is the ceremony so important? I mean... I'm in Europe, but when my graduation ceremony was organized I had already moved to another city and started working, so I just declined the invitation. 

It's just an event, as far as I know :3
Was surprised seeing UNI on Reddit... I completed my Master's there. I never thought I'd end up in Iowa, but can't think of a bad thing to say about UNI or Cedar Falls.

Except the -40 degree wind chills. Fuck those.
Isn't UNI the school that gave us The Interlude dance a few years back?  
God bless that campus.

This is Iowa nice.

UNI is a stand up university. 
Wow! The president of my school left as soon as she finished giving the opening address! Must be nice...
As an Iowan, UNI (University of Norther Iowa) is used quite a bit. I'm confused on the internet when people say uni short for university. 
Graduate as of today, go Panthers! 
Incredibly professional.  

I feel  like my Alma Mater would have found a way to charge me money or withhold my degree for missing mine.
UNI Fight!
Wow reading the title I thought maybe they delayed the graduation for 45 minutes and I was like wow that's very nice, but I feel the pain for the audience having sat through a lot of graduations myself. They are very long and grueling for the audience. Although they stayed 45 minutes AFTER the whole ceremony huge props to them. That's insane. 
Am I crazy or is 45 minutes not that long to wait? Especially for something fairly important to someone like this... kudos to them anyway

As a guy that loads and unloads a lot of trucks with a fork lift.  Those are some nice pallets.  You won't find 120+ of those laying around.

Ha. Ha ha. Ha ha ha. HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAA!
All you have to do is keep 120 pallets lying around.  You know, in case of an emergency.

Or, build a shed you can use right now.
If that house can be built in a day imagine what you could build with a stack of 2x4's and some sheets of plywood...

Building it out of proper materials would be faster, more stable, more insulating, and easier to get than the number of pallets you would need for this.
What kind of situation would you be in where your current real house gets destroyed to the point of being unlivable, yet your pallet house is okay? 

Or, if it isn't built yet, your pallet cache, and necessary tools, are okay?
[deleted]
I'd be afraid a forklift would haul away my pallet house in the middle of the night.
Splinters, splinters fucking everywhere.
Pallets are made from the waste wood of the lumber industry which is discarded for a reason. It comes from the cambium area of the tree and is not adequately dense (structurally inferior and vulnerable to decomposition).
As somebody who's seen a lot of pallets, those are the nicest pallets I've ever seen.

Usually I'm happy if they don't try to take my arm off when I pick one up.
And, apparently, you have a spot to choke a baby and no one will see. 
Yes. And house plants. Because when you need a house so badly that you'll make one out of pallets, houseplants are also a huge priority.
That's an art project. In what emergency would you happen to have 20 pallets on hand from which to build a house? If your house blows down, but you can drive to the local home center to steal their pallets, you probably should just go to a motel. 
>You can also upgraded it in time with insulation, AC, smoke detectors and anything else you would like.

No shit.

You could also upgrade it with... I don't know... a proper house?
If you need plans to build a tiny house out of wooden pallets, you should use the $75 to [buy a tent.](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dsporting&field-keywords=tent) 
Judging by my attempts at putting together furniture from Ikea and my disatrous phase where I tried my hand at Airfix models, I would probably end up killing myself and/or others trying to assemble this.
This would make a lot more sense if it was planed for Euro Pallets (120x80). Charging for the plans invalidates the humanitarian purposes!
I can't think of an emergency that would require me to build a pallet house that would not also destroy my apparently large stock of pallets.
one day my ass
All I can think of is pokémon..
Fatal oversight. If you have this many pallets to build the structure there is probably a more sturdy structure nearby housing all the goods that came in on these pallets. 
In case you have never worked in a warehouse environment, pallets are usually fucking disgusting; covered in dust, goo and other crap and usually don't make it to their final destination in one piece.  They also aren't exactly cheap, I work in trucking and lots of places that do 'pallet exchange' charge upwards of $5 a pallet, you could probably afford a couple 2x4s for that amount of money.  Unless you are prepared to buy all new pallets for this endeavor it seems kind of dumb.  Why not just use normal building supplies and methods if you are gonna buy new wood/materials anyways...
I think Les Stroud should invest in one of these.
So you're telling me there is a house behind every walmart?

'SR-71 online'
Think of it as a long, black, middle finger built to fly over Russia.


Reminds me of an unrelated joke about airplanes!

**A** small two-seater Cessna 152 plane crashed into a cemetery early this afternoon.

Search and rescue workers have found two survivors and recovered 300 bodies so far and expect that number to climb as digging continues into the evening.
I saw one in person and it literally unsettled me.  It's very very strange looking at it closely; it's like your sense of vision goes a little bit wonky and your point of focus kind of slips and slides off the lines of the fuselage leaving with you a sense that it's unnatural and that even after having examined it closely you're still not sure of its shape, like it wasn't designed by humans.

It was much more advanced than reasonably possible in the 60's, heck, it still is 50 years later and I say that it's the sexiest machine ever built.

EDIT: Didn't intend to insinuate aliens.  Go watch a proper documentary, ya bunch o' loonies!
An excerpt from the book "Sled Driver" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground." Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check." Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground." And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.

"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground." I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, "Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one." It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

If you enjoyed that story, check out the subreddit dedicated to the Blackbird: /r/SR71
I use to live in Mildenhall, U.K. for all of my childhood life.  Seeing these taking off and landing was amazing.  I use to bunk off school to go down the landing lights to watch these fly out. The air shows they had every year allowed you to get up close and talk to the pilots.  Stunning planes! 
Definite highlight for me at the museum of flight in Seattle
You can view one of these lovely planes at Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.
My husband and I were crew chiefs on the KC-135Q model at Beale AFB.  One night we got the call, grabed our mobility bags and headed for the flightline.  We ended up flying to Florida, landing and refueling, took back off and when we got to altitude we called down to Control in Florida, who then placed a call to California to tell them that we were at altitude over Florida.  Then and only then, did the SR take off in California so that we could refuel them over Florida.   That is fast!  When your refuel plane has to be in the air and ready all the way across the country before you can even take off.  The 135 had to go full throttle during the refuel, that think shook so bad one would think that it was going to shake apart.  Crew chiefs were allowed to lay in the boom pod with the boomer during the refuel.  It was awesome!

I've always wondered what replaced the SR-71's role in the modern day air force.
X-Jet?
http://imgur.com/aETYDXB
A few random items. All planes get metal fatigue with microscopic cracks, that over a lifetime, will eventually ground the airframe. The SR-71 was composed of titanium and heated up so much during its flights, that the plane would stretch about a foot in length and the heat would soften the metal so much that it would fill in the cracks. The airframe was basically reforged every flight. It also got more and more fuel efficient the faster it flew. The only limitation on its top speed was the engine cones would melt after Mach 3.7 or so. The A-12 flew slightly higher and slightly faster because it was lighter with only having 1 person on board and 1 bay for reconnaissance as opposed to the SR-71's 3 bays for reconnaissance.

Also, Wright Patterson is the world's oldest and largest aviation museum. They are moving the presidential and experimental planes to the main campus next spring so you will no longer have to take a shuttle bus or miss those exhibits if and when you visit.
You might like [this](http://www.nmusafvirtualtour.com/media/068/SR-71A%20Front%20Cockpit.html) a 3d view of the cockpit.

Also, find a copy of Sled Driver on pdf by Brian Schul. Well worth the read.
"The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. An advanced long range strategic reconnaissance aircraft capable of mach 3 and an altitude of 85,000 feet."

"You sure do know a lot about it.."

"DO YOU EVEN READ MY CHRISTMAS LIST?"
Go to RAF Duxford, you can reach over ropes and touch one. 
If anyone is interested in learning more about the SR-71 and a couple of very Top Secret aircraft, at the time, I would suggest reading the book *Skunk Works* it is a great read.


Fun fact, every second that this plane was flying at Mach 3 the engines took in the same amount of air as 2 *million* people breathing in at the same time.

But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."

Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the " Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."

And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. "Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."

I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, "Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."

It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

Fun fact- The ghillie suit is the only piece of US military equipment made by the soldier and not issued in its complete form.
He was tragically mown down by the enemy.
"A ghillie suit is a type of camouflage clothing designed to resemble the background"

Well, it doesn't look like asphalt at all.

So it was the grassy knoll.
At this range you'll have to account for the Coriolis effect. 
It's a good thing I'm not a soldier, that guy has 100% chance of killing me before I even know he's there.
No shit, these things are INSANE.

I played paintball with a previous boss who showed up in a ghillie suit. We made fun of him, at first.

This fucking guy layed down in the patchiest, dirtiest piece of land and pinned us down. 4 of us could not find him. We KNEW here was there because the goddamn grass kept shooting at us. But we couldn't figure out which patch of grass it was, or what part of that patch was him. 

It's important to know this guy was 250 - 300 lbs. Not an inconspicuous dude. Completely invisible to 4 adults looking for a guy in this suit 25 feet away. Un fucking real.
Storytime: Years ago, when I was in the newspaper business, I was at a house covering a standoff. A fellow journalist and I were standing outside chatting for about an hour. The standoff ended (peacefully). And the bush right next to us stood up and walked off. Dude had been lying there in his ghillie suit maybe three feet away from us.

I wonder if you bother cleaning out all the spiders and bugs and whatnot that live in there, or if you intentionally *don't* clean it, just to add to the illusion.
"50,000 people used to live here, now its a ghost town."
I didn't know Swamp Thing was a sniper, or used a gun, or was real!
Serious question - How does he aim and use the scope on this rifle with all the grass in the way? 
Where? I can't see it.
Looks like Stephen King in Creapshow.
My dad owned one of these from his time in Vietnam! It was really cool. He didn't want us messing with it, but every now and then when he was away, I'd sneak it down from the attic and play spy. I did this all through middle school, hiding in bushes and fields, trying to see how close I could get to people without them noticing.

One time I was trying to sneak up on a small herd of deer that were hanging around in a field by the highway. I got really close, when suddenly this car pulls over, and the driver gets out. He slammed his door, which scared the deer away. :(

He also apparently pulled over to take a leak, and thought the small grassy outcropping was a good target to piss on. I was a good spy. I never compromised my position.
I completely missed the other two snipers in the background.
This reminds me of a time I had a sleepover with a friend who insisted to stay the night.  We stayed up late playing call of duty 4 and he kept getting frustrated saying "I fucking hate wookies.  I don't want to play Star Wars."   

He was complaining about the snipers in their ghillies and also refrained from telling me that prior to our sleepover, he had ingested quite a bit of hallucinogens.

Using his fame for good. Good man
Never seen wrestling or John Cena in action but I can tell this guy is truly a great person.

I'm not a big fan of John Cena the wrestler (but I will respect the shit out of his work ethic), but I'm a huge fan of John Cena the person. The guy lives and breathes professional wrestling, and to take what precious time he's not spending in the ring, instead of relaxing at home or training more, he goes out to complete Make-A-Wish's. What a fucking dude.
John is the fuckin man. I have a lot of respect for him
I know nothing about wrestling, but the internet has made me think John Cena is the coolest person on the planet.

This is because the sum total of the planar vector field must be zero.  You'll notice that every small plane points opposite to the large excitation of the planar field; if you add up the planar vectors of all small individual planes, they will always be equal and opposite to the larger planar excitation.

when i was growing up my neighbours had a massive iguana (7 foot long), it was basically a vegetarian alligator. 

He was actually really chill, loved to sit on the back of their couch and sun himself.. until one day in February when I walked into their house wearing my favorite red toque with a huge pom-pom on top.. now King (yea.. they called it King) decided the big red head was a serious threat and needed to be promptly dealt with. From his usual position on the back of the couch he was right at the door and at just the right height to bat me in the head with his tail (that probably made up 4 of his 7 feet and was at least 2 inches across at the base). 

Fucker knocked me out cold.. I woke up to the parents leaning over me and freaking out / appologizing, saying he'd never done anything like that before etc. etc... I was fine.. but I still don't like lizards..

Actually male peacocks as seen here put their feathers up to show off for a female, so that peacock wants to fuck your kid. 
The peacock said in Bane voice:  "You merely adopted a stance of grandeur. I was born into it."

In Alexandria, Virginia there is a whole neighborhood of ***tiny***   single-family ranch homes built in the 1950's that all have radiant heat sunk into the concrete flooring.  I lived in one for 7 years.  It was heaven, especially with babies/toddlers.  A warm floor for baby to hang out on is fabulous.  Many people chose to rip out the boiler required to run the system and install central heat.  Those people regretted it.  
Radiant Floor Heating. Yes, they are very effective. They usually use a small boiler and run a type of liquid through the piping. Along with good use of insulation in the walls/floor/ceiling - these can save a lot of money in the long-run. And bare feet in winter are great!

Edit: A few people are saying this system pictured is electric. Perfectly possible, I know electric systems are also available. I work for a building supply company and we are just getting into the Radiant Heat in the past month or two.
I went to Iceland in December, and was pleasantly surprised to find that many buildings are heated this way. They basically get free heated water from wells, and pump it through the floors. They were even in the process of getting this outside of the airport in Reykjavik.
I never knew this looked that cool. I'd just throw some plexi glass over it and have some led strips and go all tron on it. 
The whole floor is lava and thus off limits
That was my one regret when I had my bathroom redone, that I didn't get heated floor. I'm still kicking myself.
The Weltzheimer/Johnson House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright had a system similar to this design.  That was back in 1948.  The problem occurred when the contractor ignored the grade of the material specified on the architectural drawing, and the system never worked properly.
I lived in Korea for 5 years and every apartment I lived in had it. I really miss it.
Rich friend had underfloor heating in his basment. A blanket on his concert floor felt better than my bed
These are great for bathroom floors! I've been looking for some kind of warming bath mat that doesn't require an outlet (because most bathroom outlets are high up so a wire would have to run all the way up and look unsightly) but apparently those are more of a thing in Japan than in the states...
when i was in korea i had those boy it was so great . i wish we had them back in the states.
Is this form of heating uncommon in the states? In Denmark where I live, nearly all houses (especially the ones built within the last 20 or so years) have them.
Any idea whether these are more efficient?
Well driller here, although it may cost a good chunk of change for the average home owner, vertical or horizontal geothermal loops can be drilled to various depths, essentially sharing Earth's energy with your home. 
I live in South Korea and this is the best thing ever. It's in every apartment. Just don't leave trash or laundry on the floor for too long. 
Wow I didnt know you can get that attention with somthing simple as a floor heating.
I live in switzerland and am a HVAC engenieer and this systems are standard since the 70es for residential buildings. Nowadays we plan them with water temperatures of around 30°-35°C, so the floor doesent really feel warm at all, but with really well insulated homes you dont need higher temperatures to heat the home which is really good if you use heatpumps because the efficency of the heatpumps are way better if you use low temperature systems like that.
The most efficient systems are TABS (thermo active building systems) where you build the pipes inside the concrete itself and use the concerete as a heat reserve, also good for cooling.
Sorry for my bad english, if someone wants more information just contact me :)

What kind of flooring gets put on top of this base?
Here's what 1500 square metres looks like http://i.imgur.com/jFPnxh7.jpg
Had a Schluter heated floor put in our master bathroom. On days when it's -30C out, sure feels...good.
In floor radiant heat is great for passing out drunk on.  So warm and cozy. 
You could rearrange furniture any way you wanted! I always feel so limited with furniture placement. Everything seems to be just big enough to block a vent in my house.
These were all the rage in 1960-70s South Africa. Today, every single one has failed and all you're left with is a hard, cold floor.

My town changed to LED last year and the lack of light pollution is incredible you can now partially see the milky way on a moonless night and the rest of the sky looks great.  
The City of Boston claims a 60% reduction in power consumption and full replacement paying of in just 2-3 years.  Fantastic program.
The light pollution effect is *very* evident in this picture.  Notice the foliage between the lamps on either side--the traditional lighting shows an orange bleed for the entire area, yet the trees between the LED lamps are almost completely unilluminated.
Those orange lights sure are going to be nostalgic in 20 years...
Which city is this?
From this angle, the LED lamp posts look to be more efficiently directing the light. Compared to the conventional post which appears to be shining light everywhere with limited efficiency. Unless there is a great deal of reflection of light from the pavement, I'd say that light pollution is less likely. The way I understand it, LED's are more directional that conventional light bulbs. But that's only my opinion.
LED looks much more natural. I hate the orange street lights. Always have. Wish this was happening on my street!
/r/darksky would like this.
depends on the white balance on your camera too
They started this in my city, and I'm actually not a fan of it.

I travel on a highway to work almost every day. The lamp posts are more spaced apart and much higher up than in this picture, so the light is less concentrated and the dark spots you see in this photo are much larger. 

The orange street lights spread the light out better and didn't leave dark patches like the LED's did. The LED's are worse during the winter as well because they are much dimmer in my city than in this picture. The orange lights help distinguish definition on the road much better, but with the LED street lights, its harder to tell where icy/deep snow patches might be.

These would be a great for city driving where the posts are usually shorter and closer together and would illuminate the street as well as it does in this picture, but for highway and winter driving, the orange is better.

But that's just my opinion
I, personally, prefer warmer colored lights.
They did this to my street sometime around 3 weeks ago. It only really decreases light pollution above lamp level. You know, reduces the pink sky effect. 

The HUGE downside is that the inside of my house looks like daytime now. And the light is blue. Blue = bad at night (thanks f.lux). 

I used to be able to sleep with my curtains open. White curtains. I hadn't slept well in a week, and had one of those aha moments when you're lying in bed at 2am, curtains closed, looking at the ceiling and thinking holy crap its bright blue in here, with the curtains closed, its bright as hell. 

Replaced my white curtains with red ones to mute out the blue, and now I'm fine. Then I think, how many people will lose sleep like me, and not realize the issue, and then wake up and screw my commute by driving tired and getting into accidents. 


And also, why couldn't the get a warmer colour temp for the LED's? Blue sucks, at least give me yellow or something. 
These new lights have been attracting the gypsy moths back

Wanna put shout out to r/invasivespecies for the info!
I have no source for this, just something that I heard, but apparently there is some question over the long term health effects that replacing the sodium lamps will have. The white LEDs simulate sunlight, whereas the sodium lamps are more similar to candlelight in terms of coloring. I guess there is some discussion over whether or not this shift will disrupt the natural sleep cycles of people walking around at night, or even having this light shining in through their windows. 

On a small scale, the shift is not expected to be bad, but if they were to replace every street lamp, apparently there might be some problems. 

Anyone care to verify or dispute these claims? 
Idk if OP knows but the LED lamps probably look better in this picture because of the white balance setting on the camera that captured this shot. Maybe I'm nitpicking though.
Chicago resident here... They have been slowly replacing the old street lights the the new LED bulbs over the past few years in our glorious city. They got to our street last fall and once the polar vortex struck with its powerful might we noticed the streets were dark at night. The new bulbs couldn't melt the snow and ice off the lamps like they use to!! They actually had crew go around and knock the buildup off. Thanks Obama!
Replacing sodium vapor lamps with white LEDs as street lights is a good plan, but not a great one.  I think that replacing them with red or orange LEDs would have been a much better idea, since you still need your night vision once you leave that road that looks like it's lit by the sun.
I hate the cold white of the LED street lamps... I liked my warm orange glow =(
It's worth noting the Hwite balance of the photo is set to the temperature of the LED lights so it makes the Tungsten lights look like shit; not a really fair photography.

[A photograph I took for Instance](http://i.imgur.com/u5JREM5.jpg), the camera White Balance was set for the Tungsten lights up front, the halogen around the side as a result turned a a very noticeable Green color in the photography; with the naked eye the lights looked the same.
I wish they'd tint them orange. It's easier on the eyes for night driving I thought. (Other than that the old ones were naturally reddish).
That tall building in the background has a face
The building almost directly centre looks so happy.
Random note - the yellow/orange lights actually produce more lumens (more light) per bulb, but due to the light being more omni-directional and having a bad color-rendering index, to humans the LEDs appear like a much better light. 
This looked so Korean, so I zoomed in and found that it was Korea.
LEDs are a complicated issue. They save energy but the cheapest kind emit blue-rich light which simulate the daylight which can be harmful to humans and animals alike. The rule to remember is to use red light at night. Just the other day, LEDs received a Nobel Prize. You can read about how that might affect dark skies and light pollution [here](http://darksky.org/night-sky-conservation/421). If anyone is interested in this subject, I invite you to check our /r/darksky.

So what's it made of?  Is there any cushioning at all?  Strange.
"MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH" you're lucky to be alive.  

Seriously though how the fuck is a model mattress more likely to cause death than a regular one?


edit** the answer is the same answer to most questions in life: [fire](/spoiler)
That can't be legal.
That's what you get for buying from Bluth Co.
It's a Homefill. 
Is 12 the number of victims?
How or why is it necessary to have a prop mattress? Why not just supply an existing mattress off the factory run? Surely it's harder to have a separate manufacturing line for fake mattresses, no?
Ran to my bedroom almost hoping that my back-breaking bed was a prop, but it's just a shitty bed.
Did the owner [do this](http://blog.chron.com/tubular/files/2011/11/mission-accomplished-ad.gif) after you signed the lease?
I'm a DM for Mattress Firm. PM me if you need something new and I'll get you something as cheap as I can get it without getting fired.
check your TV, it might be a prop as well 
It's dangerous because that material is likely HIGHLY flammable.  Beds must have a flame resistance to them, and since thats NOT a bed, its a PROP, it could go up in flames instantly. 
It was fit for a queen, however I'm pretty sure there was a pea in the mattress.

You needed 5 more on top of that m'thinks.
Do you smell that?

Smells like a lawsuit.

At the very least they need to buy you a new Mattress and a 10 pack of visits to your local Chiropractor's office (mine does $75 for an extended visit with heat and electrical stimulus if you pay in cash)
This is a lawsuit if it's actually real. 
Canadian here chiming in; that is seriously wrong. In Canada, all hotels must pass a bi-monthly law of the "soft touch" bed test. They actually have people visit and test hotel beds for softness.
Do you live in Sudden Valley?
Brings a whole new meaning to death bed.
People used to always joke about why it is against the law to rip tags off of mattresses. This is why it's the law, so you don't buy a dud mattress from a shady dealer. (Though, it can be removed by the consumer, so you're lucky it is still there.)
Sounds like it's from the Bluth model home.
I would check your lease documents to see if there is any stipulations about the furniture, have a lawyer review it as well and write the landlord a letter to have a new mattress purchased or at least a prorated amount to purchase a new one. Also renters insurance might cover some chiropractic visits to help with the back pain. Most of all talk to a lawyer to see if there is a legal avenue for you to pursue. 
good luck!
I wonder if Michael Bluth had this problem.
Is this your house?

Sorry, I forgot to put the story up. I was living at the compound that got attacked by a Taliban VBIED (Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device) that was inside of a very large truck. It rendered our compound pretty much useless. Luckily, we had no fatalities with mostly minor injuries (myself included). 

I was working as an Air Traffic Controller out there. The country of Afghanistan doesn't have the infrastructure to control their own air traffic, so it is contracted out and I was one of those contractors.

I'm curious as to what the method is for that crazy exhaust configuration. I know nothing about ~~five~~ **dune** buggies. Care to enlighten me? 
I have a similar story. I just recently turned 19 and [my father and I just finished building a dune buggy as well](http://imgur.com/a/BnWGw). We've been working on it for the last three years. 
Ok since nobody else is asking I will... is your dad still with us? My dad just died a couple months ago, age 93, leaving the world a lot less awesome.

These dune buggys were a big part of pop culture in the early 70's. I had a toy that looked exactly like this as a kid, every toy store had them.  [They even had a cartoon where the star was a dune buggy.](https://youtu.be/3hx-hEWl10c)
Looks a lot like the one My stepbrother and I bought and fixed up. Before we got a chance to drive it around, My lame ass stepfather stopped us because of "safety concerns". I still drove it around and crashed, hurting myself pretty bad. I tried to act normal but the pain was too much. My parents found out and I was grounded. I didn't really mind because I stayed home and my stepbrother became my servant. 
My father and I have a '61 dune buggy we are are currently rebuilding! Let's hope ours looks as beautiful as yours does!
That was built in 1970 for those who don't like math.

Sometimes I think people are just trying to one up each other on how crazy their pick of emotional support animal can be. First dogs, then cats, guinea pigs, miniature horses, 500 pound pot bellied pigs, and now a god damned turkey. 

Next it will be lizards and snakes and the government is going to shut it all down and limit it to dogs and miniature horses like they did for service animals. 

These hipsters are just shitting in the punch bowl because anyone can pay a shrink to say a fucking turkey is an emotional support animal.

So when all of this comes to a head in a perfect storm where someone's therapy python eats a therapy turkey 30,000 feet above Colorado I'll get to say I told you so. 
Looks like Sweet Dee in "The Gang Beats Boggs"
Adam Carolla has a whole bit about taking Giligan, his attack pelican, onto a flight as therapy pet.  

Life isn't much wackier than comedy.
IF you are so unstable that you can't fly on a plane without a live turkey, you should not fly. Imagine if that bird died mid flight? Buddy could do anything. 
avian flu - the origin
Delta airlines requires a mental health professional to provide written documentation that the passenger is being treated for a diagnosed mental health disability and the animal is a necessary part of treatment. Further, the animal is required to be trained to behave. I'm guessing this passenger didn't follow those rules, and the crew and gate agents didn't know enough to deny passage.

From the website:

**Acceptance Guidelines**

May or may not be trained to perform observable functions. However, the animal must be trained to behave properly in public settings as service animals do. Emotional support animals travel free of charge and the animal is exempt from cabin allotment. Like service animals, emotional support animals can be transported in the cabin.

Delta requires documentation *(not more than one year old) on letterhead from a licensed mental health professional to be presented to an agent upon check in stating:

* Title, address, license number and jurisdiction (state/country it was issued), phone number, and signature of mental health professional.
* The passenger has a mental health related disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 4th Edition.
* That the passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination.
* That the person listed in the letter is under the care of the assessing physician or mental health professional.

*Passengers may use a signed or stamped digital letter on their mobile device as long as the information can be verified (i.e. phone numbers, email addresses etc.)
I'd be doing this the entire flight to the bird

My hopes of one day having a service Cassawary have been reignited!
The only reason anyone would ever need a goddamn dumb dinosaur like a turkey for a therapy animal is if they needed absolute reassurance they weren't quite the stupidest organism in the room. And even then, itd be close.
If their plane crashes in the mountains at least they won't need to start eating each other right away like those soccer players did.
I hate these assholes, it makes it so much harder for those of us with legitimate, trained, vetted and certified service dogs.

I tried so hard to be nice about it for so long but I just can't any more. The day someone's glorified pet, with no public access training attacked my service dog was the day the minor annoyance of it became a real issue I'm pushed passed my limits on. You want to take your unleashed, uneutered mastiff with a piece of shit paper you bought online everywhere for the attention? Fuck you. 

When that dog bit someone on the bus now we all have to pay for photo ID of us and our dog, thankfully I already have that since one of countries I regularly travel to(in the EU) requires it.

--
**Remember business owners:** 
Even certified service dogs, let alone bullshit ESAs,  have a set of public access behaviour guidelines, you CAN remove an animal who is NOT behaving within those guidelines. 

The dog taking the initiative of greeting strangers approaching the animal should be a clue the dog is not properly public accessed trained. The dog should automatically ignore others because it is WORKING, as in focused on it's handler and it's job.


This even includes the handler responsibilities, like keeping the animal from being any kind of nuisance- via position on the floor or noise or general disruptiveness; and keeping the animal groomed, clean and non-offensive to the general public. Dogs will always smell somewhat like dogs but the dog should not be excessively smelly, should not be drooling excessively, should not be shedding excessively as the animal should be brushed daily by the handler or helper. Nails should be tidily cut and not damaging floors. 
Harness/ID vests should be clean and properly fitted. (in the US service dogs do not have to have badges or harnesses, but this is pretty ridiculous, almost everyone with a certified service dog will have it wearing it's identification vest/badge and harness because it makes life easier for the handler!! If the badges on the dog says 'do not seperate from handler' there is a reason for this- please respect this, yes even in an emergency. For example my dog traveled with me in the ambulance after a serious car accident until we absolutely had to be separated so he could receive medical treatment. During something like an MRI/X ray he is in the operator's hut in the same room as the machine but protected. )
 


And remember: ESAs do NOT have federal access rights. They have some housing and transport rights but they DO NOT have access rights to stores, theatres or restaurants!

(Also the Service Dog Foundation is now training ESA cats with proper certification and are vetted behaviour-wise, if you need a non service dog but do need an ESA get a properly trained and bred one. Get a prescription, apply to an accrediated organisation, preferable ADI certified,  and get on the waiting list like those of use with seizues/are blind and low vision have to do. Stop with this special snowflake pretend service animal bullshit. I'm sorry to sound so mean but in the past three years the rise of this ESA crap has been a real burden on those of us with real service dogs. The animal just existing is not  a job. Training a proper, bomb proof service dog starts *before the puppy's eyes are even open!!*)
More like "anxiety animal" for me. I would constantly be worried that thing we attack others or myself haha
I'd need therapy if that thing was looking at me for 2 hours.

I thought turkeys can't fly.
What I want to know is how do they keep the turkey from shitting everywhere?! Does it have a bag to catch the poo?
I thought turkeys are widely considered to be assholes? 
Perhaps if you suffer from such anxiety that you need a therapy turkey, you should drive instead of flying. 600 miles in a car with a live turkey sounds like the perfect thing to prevent this insane shit from happening.
As a Vegan, I have a therapy-cucumber. You'd never guess where I hide it. 
One flew over the turkey's nest
Maybe that turkey is full of narcotics. Maybe I have been watching too much narcos. 
airlines need to grow some balls and tell some of the "support" animal owners to fuck off
Turkeys are very therapeutic when cooked properly.

Tiny giant tortoises 
Tortoises (unlike humans and almost all other mammals) have no maternal instincts whatsoever. Their babies are lain in clutches and then promptly forgotten (though even to say that they are forgotten is incorrect, since forgetting requires some initial presence of mind: in truth this tortoise has perhaps never been truly aware [in the human sense] of what exactly its instincts force it to do). There is no plausible scenario in which those little tortoises would possibly find themselves on top of their mother: first because they are tiny and second because their mother is no more significant to them than a pile of dirt or a largish chunk of granite. In fact it is in the baby tortoises' best interest to stay away from their mother since (as I said before) the mother has no maternal instinct whatsoever and could easily and inadvertently crush them underfoot or knock them on their backs or harm them in some other way (the chance of this happening is admittedly pretty slim, but there is certainly a greater chance that the mother will hurt them rather then help them [which {I pray I have made abundantly clear} is exactly zero since tortoises have no maternal instincts whatsoever]). This is anthropomorphising at its worst and images like this that actively misinform people through implication are no different than any other kind of clickbait in that they convolute a genuinely interesting subject by (rather than putting forth the effort required to present something both interesting and informative) simply slapping an eye-catching title on a misleading image. Can we not simply accept that certain animals behave differently than us? This is a successful reproductive strategy: the product of millions upon millions of years of evolution (or perhaps not: I can't imagine ignoring your children requires a lot of evolutionary finesse: but still, the fact that it has not changed into something else speaks to how effective it is). Looked at from that perspective, there is beauty here that needs not be "enhanced" with anthropomorphic implications.

Yeah they are reptiles, and typically they don't raise their young. I imagine this picture is staged.
It's cool to see how the mother's shell is so much darker than her children's.

Thank you all so much for all the support and comments!  I am utterly speechless at how this cosplay has been spread, and honestly, all I can say is thank you for making this SO SHINY AND CHROME!

In all seriousness: how do large/cumbersome cosplays like this get around? I get that he's in an open space right now, but what about the bathroom, or hallways, or going to see somebody speak at the con?

I see lots of cosplays that are very prop-heavy, and it seems very impractical from an actual "doing stuff other than standing there" point of view.
It's one thing to be a disabled guy in a wheelchair with some nice dressings, it's another thing to be a fucking baddass with a chilling death stare.
WITNESS ME BLOODBAG!
My name is Max. My world is fire and blood. Once, I could walk. I was a road warrior searching for a righteous cause. As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more disabled... me... or everyone else.
I enjoyed this so much at Dragoncon. So much.

It must be one of those chairs that slowly rises to help you out of the seat and then hes added the back section onto it
It is the future,  why are wheelchairs not stands like this?
He sacrifices for his craft. That would be uncomfortable for anyone, disabled or otherwise.

I cosplay, I die, I cosplay again!
As a disabled individual myself (manual chair user) All I could thing about is how expensive that chair is. **$45,000-55,000** depending on the options.

Awesome cosplay though.
Hope he wins a competition.
I did not see him at Dragoncon, but I wish I did. This costume is **awesome**!

It looks like a screaming alien.

Must...powerwash...really bring the white out...nnngh!
I know this building very well as I walked by there quite regularly a few years ago. It's not just the door, the [whole building is simply stunning.](https://www.google.com/maps/@48.859233,2.300659,3a,66.8y,115.83h,109.7t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sLf9-R1G-2tbvUfKf_UmW2A!2e0)  One of the finest examples of Belle Époque around..
You know I was walking around Paris, when I was there a couple of months, just walking. I didn't have any destination I wanted to explore. It is a big city, but it is also not big.

The thing that amazed me is that architecture and history you can find that are off the main tourist areas. You can walk and see a building 400 plus years old with old historic doors. Inside a courtyard with cobble stones and people living their lives in buildings that would be historic in America.

You can walk by and go inside many churches hundreds of years old that people still use. See one of the small Museums that dot the city. Walking you can find the most amazing restaurants, grab a quick drink and see the city move around you.

Maybe I should feel bad, but when walking Paris I couldn't help to think to myself I am glad the French left the war early and it was spared destruction in the war. 
I get weird Devil May Cry vibes from it.
Pretty sure that's also the door from Casper... or at least very close to it. 
An amazing example of art nouveau.
First stop after retirement: Paris. Any takers?  I speak French. Must see it before it's detroyed in some dumb money/oil war.
Belle Epoque was the epitome of that kind of design. It died with WW1 and the end of the European empires. I wish Art Nouveau would return. It was very labour intensive but perhaps CNC, CAD and 3D printing will see it return in a updated fashion. Its so florid and strikes me as 'human'. "Arts Craft" in many ways is a distilled version of this, boiling designs to their bare, hand made essentials.

It must have seemed like the end of the era of Legend, to those who born in this period, grew up and then served in WW1.
We not talking about the massive cock  on the door? 
Reminds me of a pun in French/English. 

"Je t'adore" 



-"I love you too honey"



"No, I mean: shut the door!"
Looks like something out of Devil May Cry.

This picture made me think. Mr. Bean's so unique in that the show doesn't need any subtitles or dubbing, allowing it to have spread around the world. There aren't many other shows like that, except maybe just for laughs. There oughta be more!
I wonder where Rowan Atkinson ranks in the most recognisable face table.  He talked about it on Parkinson, where a documentary crew were making a film for Comic Relief in Africa.  In the tribe's hut, there was an old black and white TV, where they were all watching Mr.Bean.

I like Iran more and more.
Mr. Lentil?
As a Persian living in North America who never learned Farsi (Iran's national language), I can say that my extended family and I have shared more uncontrollable laughter courtesy of Mr. Atkinson than anything else. Mr. Bean seems to have borderline cult-status in Iran. Humour has no language.
This pic really captures the contradictive state of Iranian culture. You have the older radical generation that controls the government, banning anything and everything western. Then you have the far more liberal younger generations that have an amazingly sophisticated grasp on that same western pop-culture. Hopefully in the next few decades, when that older generation is gone, Iran will become a radically different country. 
Coming from a non-western culture,  my parents used to ponder over the ethnicity of Mr Bean. Funnily enough, my father's best guess was that he was probably Iranian.

In lake elsinore, snow was coming in strong up until an hour ago. I have never seen snow fall. I couldnt sleep.
I bet it has something to do with GTA 5 update
Attn So Cal Subaru WRX and SUV drivers:  now is your time to shine.  Disregard summer tires.  You're invincible.  Get out there and show us what you can do!
Well, it snows in Southern California pretty much every year; it just depends what elevation you're looking at!
I'm currently in Los Angeles and its not snowing. 
**This is an emergency broadcast message. This is not a test. The following information is vital for your safety. Seek shelter immediately if you are outside. Do not touch the snow. Stay awake. Do not look them in the eye. This is an emergency broadcast message. This is not a test.**
This is happening in the inland empire, southern riverside county.
If your roads aren't prepared, do not drive
Where is this?
Southern California here. We always get snow every year in our mountains. Yesterday the snow level came down to around 2000 ft and that is more rare. Last time it did that was probably around 4-6 years ago. 
**Helpful tips for those that have never driven in snow:**

-don't slam on your brakes (additionally: check your car manual if your car requires brake pumping or not)

-before braking, let up the gas first for about 2 seconds before using the brake pedal

-increase your braking distance significantly compared to dry conditions. You will slide if you attempt to stop at what may seem a reasonable rate normally and lose control (thanks, /u/my_dog_is_cool)

-keep a cars length between you and driver in front of you when stopped

-if you know you are going or about to go over a bridge, don't accelerate or brake unless you need to (bridge ices before road)

-accelerate while going up hills

-don't ever break going up hills

-don't ever use cruise control

-if the light turns green before you approach the intersection (meaning you did not make a full stop yet), proceed with caution (someone from the previous light might still slip in the intersection on accident)

-look both ways when the light turns green before proceeding

-keep the top of your car free of snow (for drivers behind you)

-keep the hood of your car free of snow (for your benefit when that wind blows)

-put your emergency blinkers on the moment you are seriously stuck

-wear sunglasses during the daytime (you'll see outlines of curbs and medians better)

-never use your brights (it's like a million mirrors blinding you)

Edit I can't spell 
Oh no, explosion at the packing foam factory.
And here in New York it's clear and sunny. what in the world...
That's actually a decent amount of snow
Snow Angels! Go make Snow Angels!!!
We barely survived it here in Corona. Heard it was heavy south of us too. It was very sweet watching our 5 kids go bananas because it snowed, but we were too damn tired to remember to take any pictures :( SOCAL will make it through this arctic freeze!!! With our dirt bikes and lifted trucks! 
Enjoy California!

My god, they're all gonna die. I hope everyone stays off the roads because I guarantee, and I really am not just tooting my own horn here, only about 3 or 4 people in that entire county might know how to drive in these conditions. The rest have no clue. And it's not their fault. Also, their DOT doesn't have the plows, sand spreaders, etc. They're just unprepared. I hope no one gets hurt.
What is this?! I live in michigan and that's more snow than I've seen this whole season!
I live in Temecula, Ca. Is this near there? We got snow, too!!!!

Edit: live, not love.
Definitely not the first time it's snowed in southern California for 10 years...
I got about a 1/4" of snow this morn, which is amazing for north county SD!

Playground designer here, I can explain this. The play event in the middle, a spring rider, is classified as a "sitting-rocking motion event", and as such, has a 6' "use zone" around it, in which no other play events can be located. It looks to me like that's a 13'x15' space or so, so *just* big enough to accommodate this thing. Furthermore, they wanted accessible seating and trash disposal, meaning you need wheelchair-traversible surfacing all the way around both features (the bench and bin). Finally, at that point they probably live in a place that requires fencing around non-supervised play areas, so naturally to save money, they made it as small as possible. Honestly, you see shit like this all the time, where people don't understand the cost and rules of commercial play equipment.
  
tl;dr - there are tons of stupid rules for playgrounds that lead to things like this.
Gotta keep all that fun caged in.
Good thing there's a fence
I instantly envision a kid on that little bike who doesn't even want to be there and an over caffeinated dad, sitting on that bench yelling, "HAVE YOUR FUN, BILLIE...BOUNCE HARDER, SON... THIS IS YOUR CHILDHOOD... I SAID BOUNCE!!!"

I used to live in a moderately bad neighborhood as a teen. One problem we had were that there a few registered sex offenders in the area. So the city built a park. It was literally just a bench, some flowers and a sign that said "The Park". So by law in that county or city or state, not sure which, registered sex offenders couldn't live within a certain area of the park. This also applied to schools, daycares or any other places kids meet. So any of the registered sex offenders had to move.
This may be a similar situation.

Edit: not pedophiles, but registered sex offenders. I just remembered that they are different.

I was stung by a jellyfish the size of my finger nail. Ever since then I vowed not to touch little colorful critters in the ocean.
Nudibranch
They're tiny because they're dried out. You need to leave them in a bowl of water overnight for them to grow.
Poor nudis!
Reminds me of the bugs in the lion king. Did you eat any of them and if so how did they taste? 
okay so real talk for a sec here, im having my first shroom trip ever and this picture just...it makes me very happy, is there a subreddit where there is more of this? just like...tiny life, doin its thing.

Would you kindly milk them for ADAM? 
Brightly colored animals like that will kill you.

Source: I watched discovery channel once
These are nudibranchs of which there are two main types dorids and aeolids. Nudibranchs are carnivores and each different species of nudibranch is a specialist, that is each different species of nudibranch will only eat one species of prey (the main prey groups being corals, anenomes, sponges. For example Glaucus atlanticus,  eats blue bottles jellyfish Physalia physalis). In order to keep these as pets you need to know what species of nudibranch you have (many look extremely similar), you need to know what species of prey your nudi eats (e.g. are you able to distinguish the subtle difference between two species of similar looking purple sponge?), and be able to grow/provide a steady supply of its prey.
Nudibranchs if ever are generally kept in species specific tanks due to their strict diets so to mix species like in your picture is already a bad sign. It is doubtful that these nudis are ALL being provided with the prey they need to survive and will probably die of starvation in the coming weeks. 
There is a reason you do not see these guys in aquariums and fish shops frequently as they are very difficult to keep. If however you really want one may I suggest you look into species of herbivorous sea slugs such as sea hares which are relatively simple to keep. 

EDIT: Also many of you are under the misapprehension that all nudi's sting. Only the ones that feed off stinging prey will sting you namely the aeolids which look like they have bubbles attached to their bodies (cerata). The smooth looking ones you can generally touch. 
please don't buy these animals as pets.
i've got thirty odd years in this hobby and i've yet to see a reef tank that has a healthy one of these animals in it that will live passed three months.
nudibranchs are specialized feeders, and in the aquarium hobby that means expensive and high maintenance.  
considering most reefers have the plumbing to make this hobby as hands free as possible, seeing one in someones aquarium is like watching cut flowers die.
they're beautiful and even the most experienced hobbyist avoid this chocolate bar in the black box.
Can you have these guys in an aquarium? I've always wanted a salt water tank.
As someone who has kept these as a hobby, they will likely all be dead within 3-6 months. Those little guys are difficult to keep alive in captivity and are highly sensitive to shifts in water chemistry and some have very specific diets that are only found in mature tanks. That being said, good luck to whomever purchases those cute little critters.

The speed limits in Ireland follow no logic or reason. Here's a [road that jumps from 80 to 100 a few meters before a roundabout](https://maps.google.com/?ll=52.676351,-7.253712&spn=0.000003,0.002757&t=m&z=19&layer=c&cbll=52.676288,-7.253711&panoid=DG7UnvMl9qGfosMV3QokcA&cbp=12,358.07,,0,6.6).
[This ](http://imgur.com/IxPXW) is the real Irish autobahn
I remember driving in Ireland and seeing something like that... skinny little road with an 80 kph sign.

My wife looked at me and said "Is that a bet?"
http://i.imgur.com/8K8qC.jpg

A comparison with the N4 on the right.
Here it is on [Street View](https://maps.google.ie/maps/myplaces?hl=en&ll=53.452456,-7.883277&spn=59.584863,191.777344&ctz=0&t=v&z=3&layer=c&panoid=bksT3U3CqhAFoHs1VnXm0A&cbll=53.452456,-7.883277&cbp=13,-231.9925629618751,,1,5.099324376664313). 80 km/h is the standard speed limit for most rural *[boreens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreen)* in Ireland. And no, these aren't one-way roads. Speed at your peril. [Here's another](https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.218564,-6.147497&spn=0.000944,0.002926&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=53.218551,-6.147628&panoid=wK6lfG1bq8PTND5iOMjK0Q&cbp=13,265.91,,0,11.7). 
Also many drivers in Ireland don't consider this a "speed limit", but instead more of a suggested or required average.

"Well if it says 80, I better go 80".

Prepare to be airborne for most of this lane.
Back to boards.ie with ye, lads. 
The beginning of The Guard is good for an idea of what most roads are like. Black humour on the speed and the Guards in Ireland.
rural roads in Ireland are the stuff of dreams if you enjoy driving, it makes you a better driver you have no choice about it :P
nothing scarier than being flat down a back road and seeing a tractor pulling out of a gap :P keep her country ;)
Some people do drive far too quickly on those sorts of roads. I think often they're locals who assume that because they know every turn and bump on the road and drive it at speed every day nothing unexpected will ever happen.

Setting a speed limit for a local road like that is a matter for the local council. There is a [national review](http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0208/speed.html) of speed limits ongoing in Ireland at the request of the Minister for Transport. The aim is to bring them into line with guidelines circulated by the government in January 2011. It is, ironically, a very slow process.

I can confirm this because I've driven in Ireland and it's terrifying.

It's also probably a dual carriageway.
Stick the Subaru logo in the corner and we've got ourselves a winning billboard advertisement.
My brother drives very fast down country lanes a little wider than that in England. 

On a moonlit night he will turn his headlights off and drive even faster, to show how well he knows the roads, and say "don't worry, if a car's coming the other way we'll see his headlights" ... [brief pause] ... "unless it's Dave. Dave likes to do this too". And then he smiles. 
Being an American that's driven the majority of the Emerald Isle, I was constantly amazed at how ridiculous the speed limits were. I'd go maybe 20 km/h under the limit, feel I was going too fast and still have people up against my back bumper. Driving there is, in a word, insane.
I learned to drive manual on vacation in Ireland.  Zipping around those roads in a tiny car was the most enjoyable driving experience of my life.    Taking the coastal road in Co Clare was gorgeous, and dodging the massive tour buses just added an extra challenge.  For safety of life and limb I preferred to stick to the R roads though.
That's actually an old picture, there's a toll bridge just after the speed limit sign now. 
My friend went to Northern Ireland and tore the driver's side mirror off the rental car on one of these roads when meeting an oncoming truck. When he returned the car they were just like "Yeah, that's what happens. Have a nice day."
As an Irishman I can assure you all that 80kph is a grand speed for this road. You don't even need to steer, those soft looking ditches on either side will gently nudge you back on track if you lose your way.
Damn, I miss Ireland. 

Nice landscape & reasonable speed limits.

(Also, as a german, i must insist: 80 km/h != Autobahn !)
Thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x84r.jpg) was pretty funny my first time there on those narrow roads.
There's nothing more terrifying than when I'm in the passenger seat of my gf's car, and she takes he country roads out to Donegal and they're all exactly like this picture. We'll pass an 80kmph sign, and she'll turn to me with this evil grin like "I'm gonna fuck you up!"

We're from N. Ireland where the roads laws are a bit more strict. I think Dara O'Brien but it best. 

In the UK there is Legal and Illegal. Righ and Wrong.
In the Republic of Ireland, there are 3 levels. 
1. That's Grand. 
2. Ah now, don't push it.
3. You're taking the piss.  
One of my most vivid memories of Ireland is driving on a two-lane road the size of a shoulder on a cliff-side and having people whiz by at 80 km/h.
WHOAH, here in spain the limit in not paved roads are 30km/h. Shit, Irish are crazy!

No really though this is the most impressive thing I've seen in forever.
Senator Franken is sharp as anything, and actually an excellent senator.

Storytime: My mother was (recently retired) a teacher. She met the Senator about five, six years back when he came to her school to talk to the kids. He actually drew one of these in front of them as he talked. He then spent some time in the teacher's lounge talking to my mom. At the time, my father was in the process of dying of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, which they discussed.

He met her again a few years later, and asked after him (by name, mentioning the disease - didn't just file it away under "random teacher - sick husband"), and gave his condolences. He remembered that shit the whole time, after one meeting. Didn't need to - he had her vote to begin with and he knew it - he's just got a memory like a freaking vice. 

Great guy.

Damn, nice. That Al Franken dude seems good enough, smart enough and gosh darn it people like him.
I doubt anybody else in Congress could do it.
Being from Minnesota his detail with the Great Lakes is on point because that's where he looks everytime he looks at a map. I'm from Jersey and his Maryland, Delaware, Virginia area is off and my eyes were immediately drawn there. Either way still impressive as shit.
Before he was a Senator, and after SNL he had a radio show. You may not agree with his politics, but I don't think anyone could disagree that his knowledge of civics, and how procedures in government are supposed to work is amazing.
Is there context behind this picture I'm not aware of 
He probably could also draw the districts, but that's only because it's so fucking fucked up.
He came to my high school and did it in front of the senior class. Cool party trick.
Wow! He absolutely nailed Colorado 
Al Franken came to my high school my senior year and drew this same map in front of an auditorium full of teachers and students. 
Putting MacFarlene in his place.
Everyone will judge their own state as the end all be all of how well it is done but overall, it looks right. 
And he drew it without lifting the pen.

Can someone ELI5 how there is lightning in the explosion of a volcano? I feel like I always see pictures of it,but I have no idea how it happens.  
Google guy op, takes no credit for the work, credits photographer and links to other work.
is there a higher res version?

Colima is like that.  It's rather young (about 5 million years), rather tall (12,595 feet with a 2,000 foot prominence), and highly active (more than 40 eruptions in the last 500 years).  So it's not that difficult to end up getting awesome pictures of it.

[Like this](http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/embedded_image/public/04841634.jpg?itok=LA_Jm4XN)

[Or this](http://i.imgur.com/szdpRIN.jpg)

It's also a Decade Volcano, one of 16 in the world that are given extra research and study due to their activity levels, destructive eruptions, and proximity to population centers.  There have been five eruptions at Colima in the last 18 months.
How do you take an 8 second exposure but not have lots of blur from the moving smoke and possible vibrations in the ground?

Do you want to become my desktop background? Because that's how you become my desktop background. 
That backdrop is really what makes this photo shine. Just the stars in the background seem to really help this excellent shot pop out.
It still feels entirely unfair to me that volcanos can *also* produce lightning. Like, what can't they accomplish? They create land. They create atmosphere. They royally fuck shit up under the right/wrong circumstances, depending on your point of view.

These things intimidate me.
great catch.
this is quite amazing!
Fantastic photo! Does anyone else see the Eye of Sauron? 
It's no wonder people used to believe in gods.  Images like this invoke a certain kind of awe.
Wicked photo thumbs up :)
Remarkable image. Some stars (upper right and lower left quarters) seem to be moving in the wrong direction. Can anyone explain this effect? I've seen it before.

For the record, not everybody wants to spend $30k on a stuffy, uptight cathedral wedding where everyone has to wear satin and look like they have a corn cob shoved in their asshole. Some people just want to marry the person they love with their closest friends and family around without having to stress about details.

I love telling groups of hipsters to relax and then photograph them in their natural state.  
Wow some people can be so judgy and spiteful on here. Let them do any style they want, maybe they know the faux-rockabilly  hipster pinterest stuff is tired .. but so is most anything tied into a wedding. Relax you cynical people and someone might want to marry you someday. 
occasional wedding photographer here: my favorite trick is to tell whoever I'm shooting that I just need to get a "few test shots" and then we can get started. or I've already started shooting, I can pull the whole, "hold on just gotta load another memory card!" my camera holds two cards so I can keep shooting even with one removed. usually these are some of the most relaxed and natural looking pics from the whole affair. 
I agree. Natural photos always look so much better. Maybe that's just because we normally don't see people "trying" to look a certain way for a picture and we just see them how they normally are. Or, I think, that people make themselves look worse than they really are by trying to look a certain fake way that they don't normally look.

This is in Auckland, New Zealand, and yes I have permission!! The lizard is a [tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara) - a native NZ lizard.. well, actually, not really a lizard; they are "living fossils", the only surviving members of the order Rhynchocephalia, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Oh and the artwork was inspired by [this meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLDDmuxWcAAJymx.jpg) that i saw on the interwebs last week.

Here's my backstory, from my [post about these](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3ayy4r/in_2013_i_was_given_permission_to_paint_utility/) last month:

>Here's the background story; late one night, after a few beers, I painted [this](http://i.imgur.com/NUQl7.jpg) in the local dog park. My friend snuck an article about it into a local newspaper. Someone who works for Chorus (the company that owns these utility boxes) saw the article, and got in touch with me (they had been [commissioning artists](https://www.chorus.co.nz/cabinet-art) to decorate these DSL cabinets for a few years already). 

>I get paid a small fee for each one - enough to cover time and materials. I used Internet memes as the inspiration for a lot of them, because they are our physical Internet connections - chances are images like AstroSloth and Awkward Seal, etc, had already been transmitted through these boxes before I painted them.

Wow!  I really like your work. Although it makes me realize just how inadequate I am when it comes to producing any type of piece that could be considered art :/

I like how the eye is realistic looking, like there's a lizard inside of the painted lizard.  Just waiting to get out.  Also, is your username pronounced PaulFuckinWalsh?
This is going to sound really weird, and probably out of place, but I had a really good friend named Paul Walsh who died 2 years ago. I keep seeing his name everywhere around the world, whether it be through other people who had the same name, or just the name "Paul" I see popping up on TV or the internet. I almost feel as if he's still here with me. Anywho, keep up the good paintings Paul!
Quality! Some will see this as graffiti but this is far from that, put this on canvas and I believe it will sell, do you have more to share?

Come to my neighborhood please.
As a utility locator, my job would be a lot more entertaining if all the cross boxes looked like that!  Great job!  
Portal is live folks! Prepare your submissions!
Every single utility box in San Jose, CA is painted extremely well. Some reflect the culture and history surrounding our Japantown, some are reminders that you are near one of the Rose Gardens. Or that you are close to the Egyptian museum. They're all amazing.

Also I now get to mumble something about a large cock whenever someone asks what my top comment is (cos you know, it happens so often :)
Chickens can actually make awesome pets.  I had a Barred Rock (aka Plymouth Rock) hen as a pet named "Puffer" when I was younger, she would follow me EVERYWHERE and would even go sledding with me, ride around on my shoulder, hang out with the family, etc.  Coolest chicken ever.  One time we were having a giant bonfire and she would greet guests at the driveway and then lead them down to the party (it was quite a long walk on the back of our 7 acres).
OP, I think this is a cool photo.

Man wolves are such bros. 
I know this guy, he did a book with my step mother Lorna Crozier. He was it in the water for over 2 hours watching the wolves and finally started creeping to shore and sat there for another 30 minutes and this young wolf comes up and gives a sniff and bolts back to the bush. He literally waited 3 hours in the Canadian ocean for a split instant of a photograph. He photographs in the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, easily a top 5 place is love to go in the world.
Poorly placed bait.  If you want to capture rare wolves, stay away from water and wait until night.  They spawn more often, despite having a larger pack to deal with.  
  
Just get the Bloodfang Sabertooth ASAP.  Far stronger than wolves and rideable.
Completely off topic but... That seaweed is so fun to squeeze as  kid. Its the same consistency as face wash. 
Such a wonderful pic man, wolves are beautiful creatures...fierce but beautiful.
Youd think a wolf wouldnt be venturing out into the water to investigate a large eye poking out of the water (since many animals initially think cameras are eyes, like in that leopard seal pic), since something like that would probably be a large predator like an alligator or something.

I had crappy parents growing up, and I remember one time the cops were at my mom and stepdad's house (I was like 4) and they were trying to arrest them for some drug thing. I was crying and being a typical whiny 4 year old (I was also malnourished and dirty) and this one cop kept me company in the house while everyone else was outside discussing things. He read me a book and played with my stuffed animals with me, and we had a lot of fun. After I was removed from the home, he showed up at my court appearances for almost a year. Officer Clarke was a great guy. Cops like him, and this guy really set the standard for what it means to be a public servant. 
My father was a paramedic in the city for 30 years..he has never cut a dead body out of a seat belt.
Edit: thanks for the gold! To clarify, Every time my father has had to cut a seat belt, the person was alive. Seat belts save lives, so do helmets. I always wear my seat belt, even if I'm driving around the block, not because I don't trust my own driving,..but I don't trust anyone else.
This is heartbreaking.  One of my biggest somewhat irrational fears is that they won't be able to find someone to quickly take care of my kids if something unexpectedly happens to me.  I imagine they'd be so confused and scared.  I hope they found this little girl's relatives quickly.
This brings back so many memories from when I was 7- years-old. All 8 members of my family were on a road trip in a 7 passenger van all of us were wearing seatbelts except my 4-year-old brother, Jake, who was sitting in my 12-year-old sister's lap, Cara. It was morning and I was asleep in the front seat while my dad was driving. Next thing I know I wake up hanging in the air because the van had rolled and finally settled on the driver's side.

Everyone was out of the car already and my dad helped me climb out through the back of the van. As soon as I step out I see my oldest sister(17),Lynn, covered in blood and my 10-year-old sister, Jess screaming for someone to help Lynn. Someone guided me and Jess away from the accident and set us on a blanket facing an empty field. We moved to a truck when it started raining before riding in an ambulance with my mom and Jake on a stretcher.

The 5 of us who were wearing our seat belts properly walked away hardly any scratches. Lynn wasn't wearing her shoulder belt and went half way out the window and broke her clavicle and got around 40 staples in her leg and some stitches. She stayed in the hospital a few days and made a full recovery. 

Jake and Cara were the only ones not wearing seatbelts at all. They were ejected from the car together and Cara acted as a cushion for Jake and very likely saved his life. He needed some stitches but was fine otherwise. Cara died within minutes.

After the fact I learned that Cara had been wearing her seatbelt just minutes before the accident. Lynn had asked Cara to get something from the back and she and Jake were both leaning over the backseat at the time of the accident.

Don't even take your seatbelt off for a second.

"Police say the two adults and four kids in the SUV were not properly restrained. All of them were ejected in the crash."

OK. This is terrible but if you can't use your fucking seat belts to protect your family...
People please wear your damn seat belt!! I just pulled a guy out of his over turned Ford Taurus in front of my house that had flipped 4 times Monday of this week who survived because he was wearing his seat belt. If he hadnt been im almost positive he wouldve been dead easily. It is in the car for a reason!
Some years back I rear ended another driver. Slammed into the back of their car at about 50mph. We all walked away okay. My airbag and seatbelt kept me okay. I ended up with a small burn on my arm from the airbag. Apparently even the officer told me it was a high accident area.

Now recently I was getting ready to head to Disneyland with my inlaws and infant son. We're getting ready to get into the car and I noticed the number of people(5 adults and an infant) and their car is a five seater. I asked if we we're taking two cars and they said the baby was going to ride on somebody's lap. I was a wee bit pissed and put my foot down. My son rode in his car seat and we crammed three adults in the back seat. If they want to risk their safety that's fine. But like Hell I was going to let them risk my son's.
[deleted]
It's 2015. How in the actual hell are people still not using seatbelts? I don't even realize that I'm putting it on - it's just a reflex as is putting the keys in the ignition. You really have to make a conscious decision to not put your seatbelt on. I don't feel like it's something that you just forget to do. If I'm not buckled in, I feel that everything is horribly wrong.
Here's a story I don't like telling much, but maybe it will convince somebody.

When I was 18 or 19, I lived overseas near an American air base in Germany and worked on base.  Every morning, I would leave for work later than I should have, and speed the whole way through these little villages and country roads.  If you've ever driven in Pennsylvania or other states in the area, kinda like that.

Near the base, there was a big blind corner that was pretty fun to go fast on, hugging the inside.  I did this hundreds of times, usually bleary-eyed and tired in the morning from staying up too late on AOL talking to this girl.  No big deal, the road was wide enough and there was rarely any traffic in the morning.

Then, one particular morning, I went around that curve and saw a woman in the street waving her arms.  I slowed down, and as I was doing so, I saw the car on its roof off to the left, and a body in the road about fifty yards ahead.  I pulled over, put my blinkers on, got out the warning triangle and first aid kit and ran over to the arm waver. I was the second person on the scene.

The obvious conversation happened, and I called whatever the 911 equivalent was over there, spoke broken English to some German guy, and then went to see what I could do about the woman in the street.

Her car was on its roof, and it was still running.  Something was playing on the radio and the exhaust pipe was emitting exhaust.  It was cold enough that you could see the exhaust. I turned the car off, and went back to the woman.  I have no useful medical training beyond some very basic first aid and a lapsed CPR certification, so all I could do was talk to her and put my coat and some emergency blankets on her.  She obviously had a head wound and was in and out of almost-consciousness. It had been drizzling, so the road was damp.  Her head was bleeding.  I can still see the water on the road mixed with her blood, and the dirt and rocks pressed in to the skin of her face, where her sweater was ripped on her shoulder, and the scratches on her skin.

Time passes.  No emergency services.  By this time I'd stopped traffic and spoken to the arm-waver about what had happened.  She'd seen it.  The victim went around the corner at the same time as a big truck coming the other way.  The truck was over the line a bit, and she over-corrected, flipped, and was ejected.

Called 911 again.  Same kind of conversation.  A little bit of time passes.  Finally this guy runs up with a baby in his arms.  He's her husband and got stuck in the traffic jam caused by his wife's accident.  He walked up to see what was going on and found out.  There's nothing he can do either.  Some emergency services from the base finally show up after somebody else had called, and they start doing their thing.  Those of us who are close enough to the scene are told to drive away and leave so that a helicopter can land soon.  I take my coat back, drive to work, and wash the blood off of my hands and my phone, and hide in the back for a little while so I can compose myself.

I had nightmares for about a month after that.  Not because of what I had seen really, but because if I had been maybe five or ten minutes earlier, if I was the first one on the scene and hadn't been stopped by the arm-waver, I probably wouldn't have been able to stop in time.  With wet roads like that, I probably would have driven over the victim in the road as I realized what was happening.  You can imagine what my dreams were about.

So, pay attention, and wear your goddamn seatbelts.

My friend, In a church group, got in a car accident in a head on collision going 55. Every person, except her, wasn't wearing their seat belt. Her mother, father, and 5 others were ejected from the vehicle. 3 people including her mother died, her father was a paraplegic and everyone else had severe injuries. She had a broken arm and some bruising. Seat belts save your your fucking life. This man can prove it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp

No matter how bad my day at the office is, I'm fucking glad I don't have to do this shit.
This is one of the most heartbreaking photos I've ever seen.
Wow. The most heroic thing I did today was smile at a dog.
My wife responds that these kinds of calls about twice a week. Lately she has had her car spit on because of the immediate assumption that all cops are evil and want to shoot everyone. 

Yet she does stuff like you see in the photo for a living. Last week she went to two separate child deaths from crashes. 
Slightly different scenario but I want to give a shout out to one Officer Barcus, who helped distract me, a 28 year old graduate student, after I walked in and found my father had shot himself in the head at his house. As I was the only legal next of kin there (my mom was there but she was divorced from my dad) I had to wait for the Coroner to sign paperwork. On the worst day of my life, this cop talked to me, asked me about what I was studying, and basically kept me from just completely freaking out. This was 20 years ago. It's often the smallest things that make the biggest difference. 
Fuck this hits home. Medic here. I've had some truly heart wrenching calls. One of which was a father who had taken his young daughter quadding with him. Rolled his quad and broke his neck.  His daughter sat with him for close to three days if I remember correctly. She was 5 or 6. Kept telling us to be quiet because daddy was sleeping. 

I've never cried on call before, but how do you explain to a child that young that daddy isn't sleeping. Daddy is dead. 

I went home and hugged my sister that night.
This isn't cop stuff, this isn't man stuff or dad stuff... This is fucking real people stuff. Real human shit.

For all the horrific stories about cops killing people, I worked for many years as a civilian crisis worker for LEOs.  People often don't understand how police are exposed to horrific circumstances and emotions that are 'just part of the job.'  For all the WTF and watchpeopledie subreddits here, police often see this stuff first hand.  Crime and accident scenes attack all the senses-- decaying bodies are one thing, but even the smell of blood and gore indoors is something that cannot be described.  It is much more intense than just seeing a photo on reddit.

I dealt with three cases that still haunt me.

1-  A cop responded to a dead baby in a home.  A mother just had taken her newborn home, was exhausted, fell asleep, rolled over, and smothered her baby.  Later, after that situation was handled, the same cop was called out to the interstate where there was a report of a dead deer in the road.  The same mother had jumped from an overpass at night, and was basically just a stain on the asphalt.  That cop had a very bad shift.

2-  A dead baby at a day care.... I'll skip the details here, but going through a debrief with a bunch of weeping police officers was very intense.  

These stories never made the news.

The third story happened more than 10 years ago, and it is still being litigated, and has been in the national media.  I will skip the details other than to say it involved a horrific mutilation in a public bathroom.... and a hysterical, surviving mother.  Everyone attached to the case was deeply affected for years.  I had a first responder reach out to me this week---- years later, to discuss the case.

I have a close friend who was a homicide detective.  It sucks driving around town with her, since everywhere she goes she points out, we had a murder there, a shooting there, a suicide there, etc.

It seriously does something to people, and they tend to become desensitized to many things as a coping mechanism.  It taints their world view to be exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, and they deal with life and death (mostly unnecessary death) on a regular basis.  I am not a police apologist, as I find it horrible how police in the US have become militarized.  But there is a reason some cops treat everyone like animals.

What I find sad is that many police don't have what it takes to work effectively with the general public.  They may have had it at one point, but it can disappear.  The profession should do a better job at psych screening.  It isn't that different than the PTSD people/soldiers get in war zones.  Even the 'Barney Fifes' working in rural areas are seeing brutal killings of 80 year old women in meth related cases, or horrific issues of child neglect.
Thanks for helping show the good cops, OP.
I could never be a police officer.

Imagine that kind of shit just being part of your fucking day. Once they were done at that crash site, that officer holding the child had to go do fucking paperwork.

How could you possibly get on with your day after distracting a newly-orphaned little boy/girl from the sight of their dead parents a handful of metres away?

Fuck. That.

Its not just against the internet tax, its about the anti-european attitude of the current government. The tax was just the last drop. Very sad to see how a few megalomaniac assholes are taking away a generation's hopes to be "real europeans", not just another post-soviet depressed eastern european citizens. 
Explanation of internet tax:

"Speakers outside the Economy Ministry called on Orban to withdraw the plan to force Internet service providers to pay 700 forints ($2.89, 2.27 euros) per individual subscriber and 5,000 forints per business subscriber every month. There are concerns that the tax will not be absorbed by the service providers, as the government claims."
How can you tax a series of tubes?

Way to go guys! Keep it up. 
Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but when these issues crop up I always seem to think that they are deliberate to distract from some other policy they are pushing through. Think about it. You want to push through a controversial policy limiting freedoms? Simply announce that you are "proposing internet tax." Cause protests, all news focuses on that. Your policy/law change gets through without resistance from the country. You announce you will not tax internet. The people feel happy and are none the wiser.
You don't restrict the opiate to the masses, they'll come for your asses.
I would die if there was an internet tax. Like in Democracy 3, I saw a tax for the internet to make millions, I know it's a game, and even though I'm 2k billion in debt, I'll never pass an internet tax.
I love when people post pictures like this. It always put it in perspective to me on how big it is.
With everything going on about this, and looking at this picture, all I see is that it looks like their connection has been throttled.


Probably not a good idea to have an excise tax on the most important resource required to have a presence on an international level in the 21st century.
That means 9,857,000 didn't protest and must be in favor /AT&T logic

Going off my MMO keybind skill level I can see myself hitting the wrong buttons and AOE fearing the passengers.
I work on ships and the bridges are huge compared to this cockpit. They have far fewer buttons and I still get confused at times. These guys have all these button functions. Work in 3 dimensions and have to do it at incredible speeds. Real MVPs.

Have the computer displays changed at all since the 1970's? There's something very old-fashioned about the way they look. Maybe they don't need improvement.
I love these pics.  Even though this sort of cockpit has been used for years, there's just something sci-fi about all those buttons and dials and displays.  I've done some flight simulator stuff and when you get to know what the buttons do, it kinda  makes sense why you need so many.  Each little thing the plane does has its own little button.

A beautiful disaster
One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen was a tornado that hadn't quite touched ground yet. It was a light greenish-blue color for some reason.
That's a shitnado, Rand.
I think this is exactly why tornadoes completely terrify me.  They are so pinpoint, but at the same time unbelievably massive and totally destructive.

Something that big has no business being so precise.
There's a Simla in India too. A beautiful place. 
I forgot about tornados. Fuck tornafos
Weird. Just had a dream last night of a tornado. Except the tornado in my dream turned into an Ent. An evil tree monster. Was terrifying. Idk how I survived. 
Near Limon, Colorado just west of state highway 71. I call that road the highway to hell because it gets some of the nastiest weather as the pacific winds come over the Rockies.
Not really sure the people in that house think its beautiful.
"Beautiful"

That's beautiful.

Just proof people use to have better attentions spans. You never see people carving homes out of rocks anymore. 
So wait....

He took a house and carved it into a stone?

It looks like he carved a house out of a stone. But idk.
That's a lot of fucking work. 
Looks like Hagrids crib
How did he carve it? Was he just using a hammer and chisel? Or..?

HELP WE'RE BEING POISONED
Most beautiful thing I've ever seen was out an airplane window.  I've never been able to find a picture that comes close to describing what I saw.  

The whole sky was a rainbow.  The *entire sky*.  It started out as black starry night on one horizon, and ended as a red sunrise on the other horizon, and in between was the entire gradient of colours.  Including blue and green, which you never see in a sunrise.
You can't just choose the window seat. The window seat chooses you.
[Well umm...](http://i.imgur.com/WIyeMg7.jpg)
I'm guessing you've never been tall? 
Here's how it's formed.

http://imgur.com/gallery/HthMW30
Unless you have a small bladder.  Then don't.  Just don't.

/sorrynotsorry
Window seat is awesome. I can't even fall asleep on the plane ride because I'm too concentrated on staring out the window. Still fascinating no matter how many times I fly. 

The best ones are if the plane has a window exit. Fun fact, a lot of wide body aircraft say "window exit" but that seat actually has the window like 2-3 feet in front of the seat and maybe a foot behind it. So, tall people of reddit, make sure to ask if the exit seat actually has a window. Especially if you fly on a 777-300ER.

Source, I have worked for a couple airlines, that offer window exits that don't actually have a window.
The Langoliers are coming.
ITT: a bunch of tall people whining.

This is an awesome picture.
[Yeah, fuck that.](http://imgur.com/Bqrhtlb.jpg)
I always get window seats too, mainly so I can see if the plane has a proper working phalange.
I pee too often for window. 
Langoliers 
Where were you flying over? from to ?
Judging by the stars I'm assuming this is a several second exposure? Impressive from a plane window!

Yup, I paid the extra money for seat selection on my redeye from LAX to Oslo just for the chance of seeing this.
When I was younger I always wanted the window seat.  Now I want the isle so it's easier to get up to pee.  Getting old is weird
Is that the remains of the evil, green demon that crashes planes?
I hadn't been on an airliner since before 9-11, but I had to take the short flight from Los Angeles to Oakland on Southwest at the New Year. I am a geologist so I try to get a window seat to look at the familiar features on the ground in California, the San Andreas fault and the various ranges and structures one can see, especially when the sun angle is low. So I could see things like the Kettleman Anticline and the strike ridges of the Great Valley Sequence on the west side of San Jouquin Valley as we flew north. When we got about 20 min. out of Oakland the plane started to descend into the clouds and I thought that the show was over, but then I noticed a white colored bow that appeared opposite the sun in the clouds with a white spot in its center that I judged to be exactly opposite the sun which was low in the sky. As looked, and this lasted only a minute or so, I could see the shadow of the aircraft appear in the spot. Then we got deeper into the clouds and the effect was lost. I was seeing a glory and it may be reasonably common. I may have seen one years ago when I flew to Europe. It pays to sit at a window seat.
This picture is so beautiful and I want to cry
Yeah, but then I have to crawl over two people whenever I gotta pee and that's super annoying. 
You clearly don't drink on planes. Window seat and cocktails= nope.
You can even see the big dipper in the image! 
Somewhere around the 40th latitude? Is this yours OP?

Wow, shut up and take our money already. Really cool stuff! Look forward to seeing more as your advance and perfect your craft.
This is great! The questions I think of while perusing your instagram:

- Can you control the thickness of the layer to a great degree?

- Does the hardened resin let you "scrap off" paint that you've laid down?  Either fresh or after it's dried? I've worked a bit with oil but I'm not sure how acrylic behaves exactly or how dense and hard the resin is for scraping.

- Please try [this!](http://i.imgur.com/M40mAQ0.gif) These stereographic images are easy as pie to make.  Just take two pictures of the same focal point on the piece, but a couple of millimetres apart (more or less, experiment a bit perhaps).  Combine them in a gif format to play for a fraction of a second back and forth, and it will appear 3d to the viewer :).

Wherever this happened, they should preserve it as an artifact in a glass cabinet in the entrance.
This is the kind of thing that made me really get behind safety when I was younger. When I was first using a Dremel, I thought "do I really need to wear these safety glasses? I'll wear them anyway just in case" and then as I was working debris was  hitting me in the glasses and I thought "those could be my eyes" 
These cutoff discs are no joke.  They are designed to be used in a specific way (straight through cutting using the disc edge) but they are frequently used incorrectly (such as grinding using the face of the disc) which can lead to this sort of failure, with high speed shrapnel spraying in every direction.  Even if used properly, if you don't pay attention and the kerf closes on the blade, thus binding it up, you will get a rapid unplanned disassembly of the disc.

tl;dr use these cutoff discs for straight-on cutting only.  Wear a full face shield.
[This is what would happen if he wore regular glasses](https://gfycat.com/HappyQuickDiplodocus)
We require all employees to wear this:

When grinding or cutting.

Hand and eye injuries are 99% of our recordables

Also if you do get something into your eye two moves are 1) flush for 15 minutes at eye was (seems like an eternity) and 2) go to ophthalmologist that is expert in eye injury not ER or doc in a box. Those guys do have. 24 hour call numbers

That's what eyelids are for
On the other hand he might have become a famous rapper and have a Trap Queen. 
I have scars on my arms from when a cutting disk was being used to de-burr some ready rod and it exploded, I was just walking by. Now I give shit to anyone doing the same.

I should print this up and bring it to work. I am an ophthalmic tech and every week we are removing foreign objects and rust rings from people's eyes , most of them state this isn't the first time and just see it as a hazard of the job. Completely baffles me how people can be so careless with their EYES.
His eyes! The goggles did something!
My brother ridiculed my for wearing eye protection while I chopped up a tree (and I felt multiple chunks hit the glasses). He got hit in the eye with a small piece of metal while using an angle grinder 2 days ago. He won't lose his eye but it hurts like a motherfucker. Who's the idiot now?
Some say he's still pooping

Don't be that person who's too cool for safety gear.  I'm actually  impressed with peoples increased awareness and use of safety glasses, hearing protection, helmets and other gear even if NOT required.  I mean, it's there to protect you.. and something you usually can't replace like an eye or brain.  

Still, there's always "that guy" who doesn't want to use any of it for [insert rather inane reason here].  As an M.D. they keep me in business, but I'd rather they didn't.  So remember kids, 15 seconds of putting on safety gear can save you a lifetime of injury.  Now you know.  And knowing is half the battle.   *oh, damn cartoons*
Wow I have an angle grinder and I'll never use it without glasses ever again.

That's terrifying.
Although I have no experience with cutting discs such as this, I do vividly recall a few years ago using a table saw for the first time. I did not have proper instruction nor did I review of how to use it, had a piece of wood kick back and hit me right in the stomach.

I don't play around with tools anymore, I rigidly stick to the safety instructions and refuse to use a tool without understanding it better first. Could have avoided a nice punch to the gut had I just taken 10 to 15 minutes that day. Could be a lot worse depending on the tool you're using.
I work in a Cnc grind shop with few conventional machines and shit like this gives me nightmares.


Wear your fucking safety equipment people. It's not for fashion or comfort, it's to keep your dumb ass from ending up Final Destination brand fucked up.

 Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know the cure time of aerosol pigment.
That person sat REMARKABLY still.
It could have been dry, but not cured. Cured means it's chemically stable, dry means it doesn't stick to your fingers. Most paint and glue have a curing time that's several times longer than drying. See, 5 minute epoxy that cures in a day.

Sitting on leather for a while can cause a chemical reaction.

Even the handle of the fridge was pink, although I'm not yet ready to think too hard about that one.

Except that Central Park ***IS*** part of the architecture of the city. Visitors who don't know New York history sometimes assume it's all a carefully preserved green space from before the city existed, but that's not at all the case. Central Park was consciously conceived, laid out, and constructed beginning in the 1850s in response to the need for city-dwellers to have a place to "escape" to, and while it incorporated a few vacant spaces, much of it was reclaimed ground covered with temporary dwellings. Central Park is one of the great monuments to deliberate urban planning, most of it the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.

Hi Everyone! I am Kayte Dolmatch - the photographer of this image. I'd like to clear a few things up:
1) This is my image and only my image
2) The very first time this was posted anywhere was on my flickr page with my watermark on November 20th 2014. https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaytedolmatch/15647565470/in/album-72157627317857063/ 
3) I submitted the photo to National Geographic in August of 2015 as part of an assignment "From Above". National Geographic prefers users to upload images without a watermark so I removed the watermark on the file I uploaded to their site.
4) To my pleasant surprise my image was voted Top Shot on National Geographic Your Shot - which meant it got "published" on their instagram and their blog (tumblr). This is the unwatermarked version that people have been stealing and posting all over the internet.
5)I have no problem with my image being circulated as long as the proper credit is provided - I'm so pleased that so many are touched by this photograph and really enjoy it.
6) I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark III, which allows the artist to record their name as the artist on every single image taken with the camera - this is captured in the metadata. Also seen on my flickr link
7)If you are interested in purchasing a print of this image please feel free to contact me at kathleendolmatch@yahoo.com
8) Thank you for reading this. Have a lovely day

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that "stealing" is not the correct term and I agree. "Sharing without citing"  would have been more accurate. My image has gone viral on multiple websites without proper citation and I was frustrated when I made my original post. 
By the way, the apartment building in the center of the image with the gray gabled roof and green features is The Dakota, where John Lennon lived and was killed. Directly across in the park is an area called Strawberry Fields.

Central Park is what makes Manhattan bearable, in my opinion.

It is the epitome of the need for escape from the urban cityscape and into the greenery, surrounded by two of my favourite museums, a one stop shop for getting away from the craziness that can be the city.
Just went to central park for the first time yesterday. I found it to be an absolute gem among the massive concrete jungle that is NYC. The fact that they planned this over a
150 years ago and no one has either tried or been able to develop that land into more monstrous buildings is amazing. 
Central Park is probably my favorite place on Earth besides my bed
Just a little fun fact, the lake in central park was originally a water reservoir for the NYC water supply. 
In Rio De Janiero, Christ the redeemer and the favelas have an interesting juxtaposition as well.
So much beauty on the left. So much money on the right.
I love to find  interesting buildings in New York. Look them up on google earth. Then look at the history behind them. 
How busy is Central Park on an average day? I cant imagine it supporting all those people...
I love living in L.A. and I think it just might be one of the best cities in the world, but I wanna visit New York one day!  It seems like an awesome place to live !
I really need to get to NY with my camera one day :(
The demarcation is unbelievable. You can go in five minutes from being overrun by people to basically being alone in a forest. 
Ah, must be where the biome changes. 
Honestly, if you haven't been to New York yet, you should go just to visit. Its really amazing.

2p or not 2p? that is the question. 

not 2p, 200p, that is the answer.

Here in America we squabble over putting a black woman on a coin and you guys put a badass skull on a coin for an anniversary. I'm very jealous. 
That's the coolest currency I've ever seen.
Finally modern currency is catching up to the Pog "slammers" of the 90s.
Grateful Dead!
Are we the baddies?
US coins and money in general suck compared to everyone else.
Huh. Thought they would go with a historical portrait rather than a recent one.
FWIW, the BBC are also doing some plays for the 400th anniversary. Last year we had Tom Hiddlestone as Henry V, Ben Whishaw as Richard II, and this year Cumberbatch as Richard III:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0kO-pVsc3E
America is freaking out about putting a woman on a bill and Britain just keeps making coins with skulls and shit on them. 
Looks like something you'd get from ordering a Dicks Picks Grateful Dead CD. 
That's so metal.
Anyone else collect all the different english coins?
Someone should have told them that they didn't need to use a current picture of Shakespeare.
My son collects coins from different countries. How would one go about obtaining one of these from America?
I came here to read up on exactly how large these coins had to be to weigh two pounds.  Like, that's one hell of a collectors piece.  After reading a few comments I felt like a stereotypical blonde - who I now at least have some kind of empathy for.  Fuck me I'm dumb.
There's also quite a nice one for the Queen's 90th.

Ophiussa, also spelled Ophiusa, is the ancient name given by the ancient Greeks to what is now Portuguese territory near the mouth of the river Tagus. It means Land of Serpents.

Seems like they knew something was up with those river serpents!

Every single painting in that studio is probably worth more than the entire mansion they're in.
"My name is Pablo Picasso, and MTV, this is my crib"
He looks like my landlord come to collect the rent.
It's so weird that he lived into the 70s. All of those early 20th century artists, because they feel like they're in the past, but they occasionally reach into the present. Hell, Salvador Dali died in 1989.
"Alright, I'm going to get a wide shot of you in your studio. Just give me a casual and relaxed pose." 


"I always relax like this."

"... kay."
those kicks...
For the longest time I thought Picasso was alive in like, the 15th-16th century.

Not until embarrassingly recently I discovered he was alive within the last 100 years.
I didn't realize he was so wealthy. So many other artists weren't recognized during their own lifetimes. His estate was worth over $500 million in current dollars, not adjusting for the recent explosion in art prices.
[deleted]
"Please fund my Kickstarter! This is my dream!"
never knew he did pottery. how much does his pottery go for and is there a lot of it out there?
I bet he would have worn crocs if they were around then.
I read something where he said he would only let children wander through his studio / touch things. Because the touch of a child was pure. 
This guy fucks.
I was 9 the first time I saw Guernica at the Museo del Prado in Madrid. I've been obsessed with Picasso ever since.

For those that don't know what those sculptures stand for (like me):

> 
> Depression Bread Line depicts five men in shabby trench coats and hats standing in line in front of a brick wall and doorway. As was George Segal's custom, the figures in Depression Bread Line were cast from friends of the artist. The original work in plaster was used to produce a mold for bronze casting. The five individuals, hunched over in downcast isolation, await their rations of food, playing out an all-too-familiar scene from the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s.

Unfortunately this is either a very weirdly dead gecko (unlikely) or totally fake (likely). This isn't how eggs work. They are not perfect spheres in most cases, for one. They don't fall apart on their own, for two. If they did, the animal would not remain locked in a sphere shape, for three. Freshly hatched animals are not clean and pristine, for four. I could go on.

This is what the inside of a Pokeball looks like.
When a gecko is ready to leave it's egg, the egg will wrinkle and shrink.  Then the baby gecko inside will use a special tooth called the egg tooth and force its way out.  Once out it will shed its skin within the first 24 hours of life and eat the skin.

>Coney Islands are a unique type of Greek American restaurant. Two of the most well-known Coney Island restaurants are the Lafayette Coney Island and the American Coney Island, which are located adjacent to one another on Lafayette St. in downtown Detroit. They have a common root, with the original restaurant having been established by Greek immigrant brothers Bill and Gus Keros in 1914. The brothers got into business dispute soon thereafter, and in 1917 split their restaurant into the two establishments that exist today.

>The menu of all Coney Island restaurants centers on the Coney Island hot dog, which is a natural casing hot dog in a steamed bun dressed with chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard. This item is usually referred to simply as a "coney." Another popular item on most Coney Island restaurant menus is the "loose hamburger," which consists of crumbled ground beef in a hot dog bun, covered in the same condiments as a Coney Island hot dog. Many Coney Islands also serve "chili fries," which are french fries covered in chili, sometimes with mustard or cheese added.

>Many Coney Islands offer other Greek and Greek-American dishes, such as Gyros, Souvlaki, Shish Kebab, Spanakopita, Saganaki, and Greek salads, as well as usual American diner fare, such as regular hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, and desserts.

TIL
This is the place at 6 and Haggerty, right?
ITT: Coney 2015
You have a Coney Island?
From Michigan, outside of Detroit, still blows me away no one else in the world knows what a coney island is. This place runs on Coney Islands.

Edit: Glad to hear these are popping up elsewhere. I'm just used to puzzled looks when I mention a coney outside of the area
I'm so excited to see a post about Coney's on the front page! Also so cool to see the interest from non-Michiganders. I grew up in the Detroit area where they are everywhere however I'm in Lansing now and there are only a few.

The most important things a coney must have, to me, are as follows:

1. You can get both Detroit and Flint style.
2. The place is a little gritty (which is why I prefer Lafayette over American, the atmosphere in there is amazing)
3. Someone working there has to be speaking (or yelling) Greek. If they are, you know the place is legit.
4. Bonus points if they have Vernor's and Boston Coolers (basically a ginger ale ice cream float)
5. Saganaki is always a bonus (OPPA!)

Cheers to all my fellow coney  connoisseurs!
[deleted]
I just talked to the owner of this restaurant for a news story about this. What a sweet man! He told me that he lived on a farm in Greece with seven brothers and sisters, and his parents couldn't afford to send him to school. He left home when he was 12 and went to Athens, where he was homeless, and depended on the kindness of others to give him food. He said he does this every year because "It makes my heart feel good to do it, and help a little bit." 
This has to be metro Detroit. Not aware of any other place on earth with Coneys. 
[deleted]
This guy understands real life. Good job Coney Island guy.
**#Coney2015**
"...my local Coney Island"?

As a New Yorker, this is confusing. 
That's really nice and all. But I am a national Coney Island man. Give me a hani and cheese fries as my last meal. And the answer to the big question is Lafayette. 
I'm thinking of going... I have no kitchen and everyone else is working that day.
I need this where I live. Hate getting whatever fast food is open and being "that" guy.
If I can marry this restaurant I would in a heartbeat!
Sounds better than spending it with my family
The worst part of leaving the Detroit area was giving up coney islands.
Holy shit I miss Coney Island, didn't realize how much until I saw this. I'm originally from NY but I lived in Detroit for four years; this was the go to place. 
I actually just got chills from reading that sign. It really makes me happy to hear that people can have such good hearts.
What if your home alone everyday :(
I suggest cross posting this to /r/Michigan that's a pretty cool offer.

Ringo looks damn good for 75
His son looks like a long lost Baldwin brother.
The son looks like the son of someone wealthy...
That's what plastic surgery and hair dyes do..
Starr
Don't rock with me or my son ever again.
Peace and love, PEACE AND LOVE!
He looks silly dressed like a kid.  
Just because of the hair dye? Jason looks way younger still. He also has the fashion sense of a 20 year old in 2003.
The portrait of Dorian Gray where the son serves as the painting in the attic. 
Hair and beard dye does wonders.
48 years old and wearing checkered slim Oma and a chain wallet.
Geez, you guys are easily fooled by sunglasses and a beard. Zoom in and look at the road map of wrinkles on Ringo's face and neck, versus tha smooth baby face of his son.
his son looks a bit like alec baldwin.
His son looks like he's a kid that got body swapped with an adult.
looks less homeless too
Ringo is dressed fairly stylish, while his son looks like a hobo. That may have something to do with it.
Met him very briefly at an airport in Maui, and he was very nice. I turned to my right, and he was standing right next to me at baggage claim with his wife Barbara Bach. I said, Oh my God! Ringo? He shook my hand and said "Yes! What's your name, Sir?" I said, I'm J-j-j-j-j-o-o-e-l burr derr hurr..." (I stammer occasionally) He said, Look Babs, It's J-j-j-j-o-e-l!, Wonderful to meet you" We laughed, and exchanged handshakes all around (my wife was there too).

Great memory. 
But neither of them has any taste in footwear apparently...
No he doesn't. He just dyes his hair.
It's like Edward Norton and Alec Baldwin had a kid.
Hair coloring will do that for you. Just ask Paul McCartney
Jason Star is the real life Billy Madison
After seeing how all these old celebrities look, I'm convinced heavy drug use is the key to looking young.
Ringo looks surprisingly young for a 75 year old. Does he just use good hair dye, or is he splicing up on young blood?

I wouldn't blame him if it were the latter. After all, the transfusion of young blood into an old body has rejuvenating effects, if the lab mice are to be believed. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a hidden market of "blood ministration" that certain individuals keep secret.

Though it's probably just Ringo having a potent healthy lifestyle or something.

that secret door doesn't look so secret
Didn't realize the wooden floor looked like that. All you ever see in photos is the carpet with the presidential seal.

Is this done for cleaning, or what? Because every president since Kennedy has used the same desk and carpet.

As a flooring installer I'm getting a bit horny looking at that floor.
Looks like tiny workers on the floor

Does anyone know what the various holes in the floor is for? My first guess is that they're recessed electrical outlets and the like, but I might be wrong.
As a former contractor, fuck whoever decided right angles are not important.
Those floors are so nice. Why cover them up with all of those rugs and stuff?

My God!!  He looks like he's aged 8 years!
Reddit finds out people age.
What we really need is a side by side of Michelle. Girl is crushing it. 
I seriously need to know what skin products he uses. His face looks fantastic. 
I think most people just don't get it..  for the first 20 or 25 years of life we change drastically, I mean think of an 8 year old and a 16 year old.   

then for the next 20 or 25 years we don't change too drastically..  

Then we start to change a lot again as we enter the end of life years 50-75.  It's not just he presidents, it's most people, except those strange freaks who seem to never age..  

  
I love this. Actual history, not shopped stuff or things meant to mislead
Unbelievable.  The guy looks like he's aged 7 or 8 years.  
His tie has aged horribly.
I don't care what people say... Obama was a great president and I'm glad I voted for him.
You mean... Somebody would use a meme to mislead people?
Here's how he could look if he dyed his hair. 

http://imgur.com/CgtqHam
Naw look! He was smiling in the first photo, and now he has his mouth open. Being the president sucked all the joy and life out of him and crushed his will to be happy forever /s
He looks a bit skinnier now.
Anyone else amazed with how fast time has gone by? I remember him being elected as if it were yesterday... 8 years.. Goddamn.
I would bang. 
Being president ages a person. Look at before and after pics of any of them. Looks the same. George Ws hair actually got darker for a bit after he left office.
You may notice the vein on the side on his temples has become much more pronounced. Along with the obvious graying of the hair. I guess being the leader of the free world will do that.
The microphone looks good, perkier even.
That man has seen some shit...aliens?
Can someone share a pair of pics of themselves now and 8 years ago to see the normal rate of growth.
thank you, that other picture was pissing me off.  It's was like a before and after infomercial where they have terrible lighting on the before
Even this picture is giving a false impression, albeit the opposite one in so far as it tries to make him look older in the before picture. The picture of him when he was younger has him smiling widely which of course creates wrinkles and lines as the muscles of his face contract. This lessons the impact of any permanent lines on his older picture. 
  
TL;DR A better comparison would have the same facial expression in both and no wide smiles. 
TIL people age
He was greying a bit in the first, and then 8 years later he is even more grey. Hmmmmm. How the hell?
Wasn't your mole on the other side...?

The four-wheeled wooden chariot, its intricately carved bronze plating and fittings, plus the skeletal remains of two horses and a dog have been preserved in situ instead of being removed to a museum. Thracian chariots were often buried with up to eight horses and their elaborately decorated bridles. The bronze plating features scenes from Thracian mythology, like the god Eros, a jumping panther and a mythological animal with the body of a panther and the tail of a dolphin.

I think this is probably the coolest thing I've seen on reddit in a while.

the horse head it's pretty well preserve. Even the mouth things and stuff
Ben Hur, done that
When was this found? It seems like this is a fantastically important find for historians, archaeologist, anthropologists etc., is that right?

EDIT: Also looks like a boss from Dark Souls 2, which is awesome.
Taking your horse to the afterlife kind of reinvigorates the "beating a dead horse" concept.

I` m Greek and from Thrace in particular ( that's the name of the province, no city with this name exists). Pretty close to where I live , is a huge cave which is said to be the cave where Polyphimos (cyclops) lived. Found next to a small village built upon the ruins of an ancient city. (It's a small one, but has a pretty well preserved amphitheater).
Wrong, this is archaeological evidence of these [guys](http://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/file/view/Wheel%20Skeleton.JPG/477302902/Wheel%20Skeleton.JPG).
That is incredible!
Jupiters cock! 
The creepiest part is one day people will be uncovering our current civilization just like this.
My gramps is from the village in where this was found! I've been to the actual archaeological site. It is amazing in person. That is all.
Has someone been playing chess in the middle of the burial site?
SPARTACUS!
And they said it vanished without a Thrace.... :P
So like, did they kill the animals and leave them in the tomb, or did they just wall them up inside alive?
wonder if they had insurance, if this was a crash death of horses and dog and entire chariot
Is there a picture from another angle?
This is very exciting for all of us amateur thracologists.

Yes, it's a word.
I'm no archaeologist but I can say this chariot reached up to 2hp of power.
At first I thought the green bits were a town and those wheels were giant tracks of some sort. Got mildly freaked out until I read the title.

Gotta lay off the weed.
That is pretty fucking cool.
Wonder what would be the cost of that chariot and 2 horses in today's dollars. The guy buried himself with his Ferrari.

Weeeelll how slobbering are the kisses and how hard is the biting. I have been gently bit by a playing dog and I would prefer that over drowning in dog spit.
I doubt he's bitey. We used to have a dog like that. Was just "smiling". Scary the first time.

Don't get your hopes up guys.  They're probably expecting their workers to be good at their jobs and stuff.  
My employer: replace "it is ok" with "if you do the following you're getting fired" 
Here's the original source: https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/

A printable PDF is linked at the end of the post.
That poster was my idea. I wrote it with help from colleagues, and we printed it out and stuck it on the wall.

[This blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/) explains the whole story. 

Today (by co-incidence) there was a [follow-up post](http://digileaders.com/ok-think-loud-organisational-culture/) with some other thoughts.

To answer a few of the questions I've seen in the thread:

* I work at the UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) and yes, we are hiring
* yes this is real
* no, there was no input from Human Resources or from senior management
* we did it because we work in an organisation where doing things like this is ok
* it's not aspirational; this is a list of things newcomers need to know about how things already are
* yes that's our office building in central London, but we share the building with other organisations so it's not all ours
* the poster mentions Slack because Slack is one of the tools we use to get stuff done; we use many other tools too :)
* as others have pointed out, there's a print-your-own PDF linked from [the original blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/), so if you'd like to put a copy up on your wall, you can


> stay home when you feel ill

I wish more people did this. I work in a large building with a lot of employees. They'll cough, sniffle, sneeze, wipe their nose and just generally leak. 

It's gross, and you're not a 'trooper" for working when you're sick, you're putting me at risk of catching whatever nasty-ass shit you've caught.

Stay home and rest - don't make the rest of us have what you have.

EDIT: of course this only applies to companies that give you sick time!
[Picture of the boss.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yHJVlf-SLgg/UjSxTIsZR6I/AAAAAAAAAPs/DbeAaLDZ18k/s1600/office-space-lazy-mode.png)
This would only encourage me to work harder and be more loyal to the company. 
No, it's bloody well not okay to sing at work. Not everyone has a pleasant voice. 
This only works with people who *want* to work. The kind of people who want their work to always be top notch because they feel it's a reflection of them as a person. If you happen to find the rare office full of these people, then these kinds of policies provide the necessary freedom for the job to get done the most efficiently and at the highest quality.

In the countless offices and jobs where people are just there to collect a check, this absolutely does not work. And I'm not necessarily always blaming the employees. Some jobs are just shit and no one would ever *want* to work it. It just is what it is sometimes.
Plot twist: This is an ad for Slack.
Where I work the list would fit on a sticky note.

It's ok to......work, because that's what I'm paying you for. Now get back to work and stop wasting my money reading notes on the wall.
Employees can be treated like people? I didn't know that was an option.
I like the "not check your email out of hours" bit.

Nothing pisses me off more than getting hounded for not responding to emails, when I haven't had a chance to check them.

*walk into office*

"Hey, you never responded to my email."

"When did you send it?"

"Last night, at around 7pm."

"....correct, I didn't respond. I wasn't working at that time."

*fast forward when someone complains about it*

"Part of your job expectation is that you check your email and respond promptly."

"Okay, then show me that clause in my contract. Because I'm pretty sure my contract states that I'm supposed to do my job well, as instructed, and on time. Now if you want to add a 'must check email every few hours' clause to that contract, by all means, go for it; but, it better be accompanied by a higher wage."

&nbsp;

Aaaaaaaand, while I'm on this rant:

"Hey, I'm still waiting on a response to that email I sent you."

"You mean the email asking me <insert random question>?"

"Yes"

"Well, we had a one-on-one meeting about it. And *then,* the next day, you asked me about it in person again. I considered the question to be answered (twice) at that point. So no, I did not respond to the email (outside of work hours), because I considered it to be a waste of my time."

"Well, I need written confirmation from you."

"That's absolutely understandable, but if that's the case, DON'T FUCKING ASK ME ABOUT IT - *TWICE* - IN PERSON. Or at least have the forethought to say: "hey, I know we already talked about this, but I'd just like written confirmation." That's a little better - BIT EVEN SO: if you really need the written confirmation, then don't bother with the in-person questions. Send an email. Ask questions. Get answers. Boom - written confirmation, and we've both only had to address this issue one time. That means that we're not getting paid to waste time, and I'm not slowly hating you for asking the same question multiple times.

&nbsp;

Sorry guys - I could go on and on and on about this. Apparently I "have a reputation for not responding to emails," and it just blows my mind. No one at my office seems to agree with my rules, which are as follows:

1) If you send an email during off-hours, expect a response during on-hours. 

2) If it is urgent, and cannot wait, call me. Even if it's to say "hey, I know it's 8pm on a Saturday, but there's a serious situation that needs addressing. Are you available to check your email?"

3) If you ask me a question in person, do not ask me the same question in an email, unless you at least acknowledge that it is a follow up, and you just need confirmation.

Work hours are work hours. Off hours are off hours. I'm perfectly willing to spend some off-hours working from time to time, as it's something we all have to do now and then; however, do not expect me to be glued to my email, as if I have nothing better to do than to work for you while not getting paid.

&nbsp;

FUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKK

&nbsp; 

EDIT: Whoa! I don't know if this qualifies as "RIP inbox," but I surely did not expect this many replies! A couple of responses that may put things into context:

&nbsp;

1) This is not a salaried position. I freelance (to an extent), so these are part-time office hours at this company. I *absolutely* agree that, if I were salaried here, then I should be less hostile about unnecessary emails, and way more appreciative of that fact that I'm pulling in a decent annual, completely stable and reliable income. 

2) Although I *do* believe in everything I said, and stand by it, I'm not really this hostile at the workplace. In comes Reddit, where I can enjoy writing up a fiery rant - the type that I would never actually display at the office (although I have made these opinions known, diplomatically)

3) Given that I really provided no information as to what I do, where I do it, or what my office situation is like, I totally sympathize with those of you who think I just hate my job, suck at it, don't put in any extra effort, and won't "climb the ladder," (so to speak); however, it's probably worth noting that I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisors and coworkers, and though I have this reputation about emails, I also have a reputation for doing far more work than is required (and happily so, because I *do* believe in the company and its overall goals), as well as a reputation of going out of my way to help guide other workers in how to do their jobs more effectively. I love my job, but it is a small company, and because I believe in it, it sometimes feels like a full time gig - without the benefits. Perhaps that is why I get a little snarky about off-hours emails.

4) Lastly, the head of the company has almost always taken my side in this issue, and has complained to managers about sending six emails that could be consolidated into one, as well as trying to limit emails to office hours (when it's not an emergency). This was meant to be more of a Lewis Black style "let me rant about this small thing!," rather than a "my company is absolute shit for doing this to me." (That being said, again, I stand by my reactions!)

&nbsp;

SECOND EDIT: and my gold cherry has been popped, it would seem. Obligatory thanks, kind stranger
Seeing this makes me feel happy knowing that there are good employers out there, and simultaneously sad that I work in an exploitative hell-hole where most of the things on this list are *not* ok.
Lots of people asking where this is, are they hiring, or saying it's made up...

It's from the team at the UK's Government Digital Service. 

https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/
Judging by the comments here, inclusive workplaces aren't as common as I thought.  This is just basic respect for your employees, I'm bummed a lot of people think this is a weird idea.


Edit:  To clarify, I'm bummed that people are forced to work at places that reward presenteeism and conformity, as I was naiively under the impression that more workplaces understood that those aren't the best ways to get optimal results from your employees.  I wasn't saying that you're all fascists or a part of a major problem if this way of working is new to you.  There used to be a course on EdX by Catalyst about this kind of thing that is probably still available for audit if anyone is interested.
Are they hiring?
Irony - most people are reading this on Reddit at work.
That looks like a cool building!
The only explanation. They grow marijuana. 
Well this makes me sad about my job even more. Serious question. Am I the only one who wonders if I'm lazy, or just want more from my job than just a paycheck? Or am I alone in this one?

Two thirds of Americans who declare bankruptcy cite medical bills or illness as a significant cause, and 75% of those who cite medical bills as the cause had health insurance at the time they incurred the bills. 

[Source](http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/insured-but-bankrupted-anyway/?_r=0)
They are very accommodating, though. You have a generous 2 weeks to pay.
I mean, you have to realize something is wrong when one of the most popular television shows in America is about a dad who starts making meth to pay his family's hospital bills.
If its a legitimate bite, the body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.
But at least it was nice of them to build a pharmacy in your honour.
Da fuck $83,000 for pharmacy?????
For that price, why would anyone want to get bit by a rattlesnake? Not worth it IMO.
Swede here, when it says pharmacy at the top, DOES IT MEAN YOU FUCKING BOUGHT THE PHARMACY?!
I would rather that it just killed me.
And the amount they expect to get from somebody with no insurance:  $0.00
I'm living in Canada on a working visa. My health insurance costs $30 a month. 

I went to the hospital yesterday with a suspected broken rib and showed the receptionist my health card. I received an ultrasound, ECG scan and an X-ray. The doctor diagnosed me, wrote me a prescription for pain killers, shook my hand and wished me good luck. No bill whatsoever. 

How can "the best country in the world" be such a nightmare for its citizens to live in? 
I'm in the wrong business.

1. Set up hospital in America
2. Release snakes

Watch out for the draugr. Looks like he's got some kind of enchanted weapon.
OP, which is it? Dragon's belly or ice cave.
This is amazing. 

But I feel like images lose a lot of their quality when the HDR is overdone.

Seriously though, long exposure and everything, this is great.
I think I see a draughr wight lurking in the background there...
A girl in my one of my history classes in High school used to make stupid shit up about dragons living on top of Mount Fuji.
She said that no one ever climbed Mount Fuji because Dragon ate them.
She also had a glass eye and  lazy I on the other side and swore that the Kane from WWE was her uncle.


Neat
Ice.... Cave... under a Volcano?... sounds like a death trap.
This reminded me there was some pseudo-scence attempt in some website somewhere to explain how dragons would be and they were apparently made of carbon fiber that would allow them to have hollow bones like birds, so they'd be light without losing durability to allow flying. They'd have a sack of methane or some gas in their stomach which they would spark with a specialized lighter-like organ in their throat that would allow it to breathe fire. 

It also claimed the last live dragon was spotted in the 1800s, a very small species captured and shown by a circus.

What exactly caused that smoke plume and explosion? Is that one bomb or some huge raid? I can't even comprehend what it must be like over there
I can't even relate to this. To be so trapped with nowhere to go. If things ever got this bad where I live, I could just leave my city and live in the wilderness and never be found again. Sure I might die of dysentery, but I've got *options*.
I can't believe this is a real picture. My heart aches looking at it
Is it possible for someone to give me a non bias breakdown of this conflict?
Imagine what proportion of the people living in Gaza are suffering from PTSD
I find it ironic that they fight over this land for its significance as a place of god, but it ends up looking like the home of the devil. 
The thing that most people dont realise is that they will not be able to rebuild Gaza easily as the are not allowed to import any construction material unless its for a UN approved project so good luck to them trying to rebuild their city.
What's sad is that is during Eid, this is the worst time to bomb as there's so many family gatherings.
Fuck, this is horrible. War is such a fucking stupid thing.

For those of you ignorant to reality:

The Israeli's and the Palestinians are good people. Governments make bad decisions just ask an American. 
I know there are intense debates going on, and crazy political complicated grudges that have been going on for years, but how on earth can anyone look at this picture and think it's justified?

Edit: ok I'm thinking you're missing the point of the comment. This kind of violence IN GENERAL isn't justified to me, EVER.  I don't care what either side has done, this is obviously fucked up. That's all i have to say.

I know this probably seems weird...but I really want to touch the floor in that warehouse. 
Where I used to work, they had just started producing these. They're incredibly expensive to transport. My company spent a quarter of a billion dollars on logistics for wind blades last year. 

Also, the current strategy for increasing power production is just to make them bigger. They're currently planning on making blades 60-something meters long. 

And it's a total pain to make/have made because you need a massive factory floor to make them since they can't make a strong enough modular designs currently.

>What Trish hadnt seen was that at the moment she said Smile! a sea lion had leapt about 7ft out of the water to get the fish, and grabbed my left hand in the process. Sea lions have canine teeth, just like a dog. It dragged me headfirst into the water. Id actually seen it out of the corner of my eye a split second before I felt the pain. It was big and had such strength. It pulled me straight down to the bottom of the bay, about 25-30ft. I was moving incredibly fast through the water. It whipped me back and forth five or six times. I thought, Well, now you know how you are going to die.

>I was in survival mode. I was fighting to get my hand free, and after a lot of struggling, it finally let me go. I was kicking to get back to the surface when it swam back and took a bite out of my ankle.

>My experience of free-diving saved my life. When I went over, I didnt open my mouth. If you do, seawater forces its way into your lungs and you sink like a rock. The water pressure could have blown out my eardrums, but I equalised the pressure by swallowing. When I surfaced I could hear my wife screaming my name. The whole thing lasted no more than 25 seconds. I climbed the ladder on to the boat and lay down. Every breath felt like agony. There was a huge hole in my hand, the blood was gushing out.

Damn.  Don't mess with seal~~s~~ -ions.

Let me give everyone a tip from a San Diegan. Stay the fuck away from the sea lions if you come here or anywhere else that has sea lions! They will not mess with you as long as you respect them. If you go near them they may get very defensive as they're a very territorial animal. I watched a Japanese tourist get completely f'd up at la jolla cove a couple years back, dumb ass was reaching her hand out to pet it. Before anyone could get to her to tell her to stop her it bit her forearm. They're beautiful and pretty docile mostly, so don't be really freaked out by them, just show them spacial respect.
Wow. Looking at the picture again you can see his hand in the sea lions mouth where he is holding the fish. Incredible.

He's such a class act. He still makes regular visits to the children's hospital in Indianapolis even though he lives in Denver now (he visited my cousin's son who had leukemia a while back). Go 18.
He's too busy putting my fantasy football team on his back therefore he can't attend. Sorry!

If I had a celebrity show up to my wedding, I'd invite John Stamos. When the officiator asks if anyone objects, I want him to stand up from the band and give a passionate speech to my bride about how he's always loved her and he can't let the wedding continue. Then, my bride tells him that, although he's one of the handsomest men in history, there's no way she could choose him over me. John Stamos walks out dejected, but understanding.
I got an autograph from Peyton that says "Best Wishes" too. How could he give you his best wishes when he already sent them to me?

I think OP is a liar.
Manning is a stand up guy
That's lucky. Normally you would have to Peytons of money for his autograph.

Related story:

I was once employed by DirecTV, which claims exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package. Each year, the top seller of the Sunday Ticket package in each DirecTV call center was given some recognition and award by the NFL. It so happens that a friend of mine (Jason) won for our call center and the prize for that year was to fly out for a weekend trip on location for the filming of an advertisement for Sunday Ticket.  Mr. Manning was being featured in the ad and all of the award recipients and their guests were to do a meet and greet with him during filming. I asked Jason if he would be willing to take a football card and have it signed, to which he agreed.

When Jason returned from the trip, he presented me with the signed card (personalized to me) and told me about his meeting with Mr. Manning. He said there were something like twenty people that had gone on the trip, and that Mr. Manning had apparently requested small bios of all of those who we're coming to the meet and greet. When they arrived, he addressed each of them by name and talked with every one of them personally about their lives and thanked them all for their efforts to help market the NFL, etc. He also joked around with all of them while he was filming the ad and was just generally very personable and great.

Since having learned about the events of that trip, I have always had a high opinion of Mr. Manning, feeling that his treatment of those in attendance was far above what many players would offer in a similar circumstance.

TL;DR - Peyton Manning treats a bunch of fans very well during a meet and greet.
I like that he took the time to fill in the "r" in "Mr" before his signature.
When PM was in his final year in Indy during the injury season, some family friends would see him before the game pull into the players lot in his car before the game as they tailgated across from the entrance. (One time he even rolled down his window and jokingly asked for a hotdog.)

During the final home game of the year, after seeing the same die hard group there through every game in that season where the Colts went 2-14, he approached the group before the game unsolicited and thanked them for their support during the long year and posed with some pictures at their tailgate spot.

He will always be my favorite athlete of all time, and even though we are set up better for the future with Andrew Luck, I miss Peyton every time I see him play.
I'm pretty sure Ryan Leaf is available.
Plot twist: OP's sister's fiancee is Eli Manning.
Peyton is all class.
What an idiot. He's forgetting that weddings usually have open bars and attractive young women 
Its like is is quoting himself. Best wishes - Peyton Manning. From Peyton Manning. Thats the way to put yourself on the map. Start quoting yourself like its a famous quote already.
I can't read Man Cursive, could someone translate for me? It looks to me like it says "Bat Winda" or something.

Story:  The mom was hit by a car, we didn't know until the babies under the porch were not well two days later.  I took this one and fed her puppy formula every few hours for two days; took her to work with me, kept her in a cooler full of my shirts in the shade.  Day three her eyes looked great and she was active so I did some homework and found a local vet who rehabilitates squirrels and skunks and [shipped her off to rehab](http://i.imgur.com/Xn9KawT.jpg).   I was sad to see her go but I can't be raising no skunk.

Edit:  Baby skunks bark and growl like tiny dogs - she would yap when I picked her up and growl until I let her smell my face.  Cutest thing about her.  I have a few more pics but I won't be able to upload them until tonight when I get home.

Animal control officer here.

Skunks, at least here in my part of Texas, are the number one carrier of rabies. As many as 2/3rds of skunks tested return positive results. It's not likely the baby has it, but it is possible. It's spread through the saliva and mother animals tend to clean their young with their tongues so while unlikely, it CAN be spread without requiring a bite or scratch.

The virus likely wouldn't survive long on the baby's fur but I'd still exercise caution. Wash your hands thoroughly. Don't rub your eyes or pick your nose. This is assuming you made sure you had no open cuts on your hand before handling it.

Baby skunks are kind of case-by-case when it comes to spraying. Some of them won't do it at all while others will lift their tails and spin around like a garden sprinkler. Approached carefully, most skunks won't even spray.

If you notify your local animal control agency, just a heads up, they'll very possibly treat this as an exposure and, for your own safety, euthanize the skunk and submit it to be tested for rabies.

Well, it wouldn't be /r/pics without an unnecessary story as the title. 
There will be a time when she's grown a bit older, and there will be this vague memory in her head, floating around in bits and pieces of nostalgia as memories do when we no longer need them - there was a rainbow, and beautiful clouds, and it had rained, and I was in my pajamas for some reason - and you will show her this photograph. And she'll be happy to see some affirmation of this memory's existence in time, a photograph somehow as beautiful as the memory itself. Beautiful. 
GET TO THE CHOPPA
Real solid framing of your daughter under the rainbows! The perspective distortion from the wide-angle lens makes her look giant against the trees in the background. Good use of the reflective wet pavement too. Colors are a bit too yellow in the skin tones and trees, even for a the warm tones of a sunset (assumed).

Very strong pose and expression, very dynamic.

On top of that, this is a great photo of someone you care about, so overall this is excellent.

Yeah the shell is pretty cool, but the weird thing about the tortoise/turtle skeleton is those struts near the front, the scapula/shoulder blade is INSIDE the ribcage.

How the hell did it get in there when most shoulder blades are on the outside of the ribcage? 

Pretty cool development from embryo show us that the close ribs move backwards and reduce first to allow for the scapula to sneak inside, it is hard to explain but there are good 3D visuals to show the [process](http://www.cdb.riken.jp/jp/05_development/turtle/turtle01.html). Oh and a chicken for [comparison](http://www.cdb.riken.jp/jp/05_development/turtle/turtle02.html).




What are the largest internal organs? Looks like you could stuff a lot of stuff in there.
I'm not a tortoise expert, but I'd like to think that I am. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the hollow space inside of a tortoise is filled with caramel. 
So wait... you CAN'T remove their shells?!
Wow. I always imagined that the shell was this cool little den they could crawl up into when they wanted to chill by themselves. 
Armadillos looks weird too.

I swear turtles are out to haunt me on everything.  From shows I watch to reddit.  On Sunday as I waited in my car for my husband to get his weekly haircut,  a box turtle must have crawled under my car to get out of the rain unbeknownst to me.  Well as I was pulling out of the parking spot to leave,  I hear a loud crunch.  I started freaking out because I didn't see anyone or anything while I backed up.  Turns out he was under one of my front tires.  Was a sad day for Mr turtle. And now for the past 3 days I've been seeing turtle stuff everywhere.  I feel horrible for what happened.  I'm the type of person who would stop and wait for an animal to cross the road (long as it's safe to, or I'd try to avoid hitting the animal all together). I know there are times where it's unavoidable but if it's possible I will avoid it.  So when this happened my heart just sank.  I shouldn't feel this bad but I do.  
I've known that turtle/tortoise spines are fused to the shell and that the shell was apart of their bodies as much as our rib cages are a part of ours but I've never really seen a tortoise skeleton before, or what their necks do when they draw them in, or how their organs are organized. It's really weird and cool.

I'm excited because I'm learning something new and cool and I don't see a lot of threads on reddit that do that for me.

And that's mostly my fault. D:

Anyway, thanks for sharing this, it's made my night a little better.

...says the upright-standing mammal.
Growing up as a hunter/fisher; one summer while about 11 or 12 my grandparents neighbor traded me rights to fish his pond all summer as long as that  every turtle I catch...well, I kill.

It was a stock pond in the middle of a dairy pasture.  Turns out that cows would wade out into the water to cool off or generally do whatever cows do when they want to wade into water; and the turtles, who were getting larger and out of control, would snap at the cows teats and sometimes bite them right off.  Cows are generally pretty stupid, so they would keep on going in the water, and a scarred up teatless dairy cow is no use to a dairy farmer.

The turtles would also kill the stock fish; typical pan fish like perch and the occasional bass.

Anyway, being enthusiastic about being able to fish indefinitely in exchange for dead turtles seemed great for prepubescent me.  I've eaten turtle before and I've killed game by this point, so I was totally comfortable with the idea of turtlecide.

The first day didn't turn out so well. I brought along my dinky .410 shotgun and proceeded to fish. I got a few perch on the hook and brought them in no problem.  They were scarred a bit from the turtle bites and I patiently awaited hooking a turtle.  

Of course, I soon realised that I didn't have to wait until I hooked one at all and would wait for them to come up to sun and take a shot at it.  Turtle shells are very resistant to .410 pellets.  Needless to say, no turtles got killed on the first day.

That night, I ask my grandpa what would be a better solution to killing turtles. He said that the gun wouldn't work, but in the morning to grab a claw hammer out of the shed and use that.

Now I've seen catfish farms, and in order to take a catfish from the farm and kill it, you usually stun it by hitting it in the head with a bit of wood before you ice it.

So the next day i set out with my pole and hammer to fish.  I set up my rod and proceed to hunt turtles while i wait for a bite.  I catch one on the grassy bank and deftly kick it away from the pond, there is no escape.  Now, in my mind, a turtle is just a lizard in a shell, like the cartoons.  I say a quick thing to the turtle, much like any hunter does after taking an animal to thank him for his sacrifice.  I give him a moment to come to terms with his fate as I raise the hammer.  I swing down, thump. Only a scratch. Thump thump thump. Not even a dent. Frustrated, I retrieve a cinder block to place the turtle on.  This does the trick. No more springy earth beneath him to absorb the hammer blows. In one fell swing I hear a crunch as the shell opens.  To my surprise I find that inside the shell is not a soft body waiting for a quick stab. There are organs in there; the shell *is* the skin.

I finished the kill as quickly as I could; packed up my tackle and left, dumping the carcass in a bucket in the porch.

I told my grandpa about it; and he retorted that the hammer was to whack him in the head, just like a catfish, so you could open his neck and get it done quickly.

I learned that day, that I no longer had a taste for turtle.  I never fished that pond again either.
i always wondered how [this guy](http://lazerhorse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Great-Pacific-Garbage-Patch-Pacific-Trash-Vortex-Deformed-turtle-plastic-ring.jpg) was able to survive, and now I know
So ... you mean turtles can't take off their shells? Nor can they hide in their shell and come out opposite end?!

How would you get a bird to be held like that witzhout taxidermy? 
I can almost imagine me talented enough to draw that with colored pencils 
You know how camera lenses have writing around the edge to tell you about the focal length, aperture and whatnot? That's kinda what the eye looks like.

Why are you holding its feet?
Worth, by my approximation, about two in the bush.
Remarkable bird, the Violet Backed Starling, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage! 
Nowadays, whenever I see an amazing bird, my first thought is "That is a dinosaur".

And I'm amazed twice over.

Interesting. There's a proverb in Chinese, which pretty much translates to "Use cat as reference, draw a tiger"
It's cool but it would look a lot less weird if the cat had the paintbrush in its mouth. Would also match the pipe in Norman Rockwell's mouth in a funny way.
[I also did my own take on this](http://i.imgur.com/yuBBpmG.jpg)

The three that are clearly visible for me are Edward Scissorhands, Fear and Loathing is Las Vegas and Pirates of the Carribean. Can anyone else tell me what other films are represented?
* **Edward Scissorhands in *Edward Scissorhands*:** ... the scissor hands
* **Sweeney Todd in *Sweeney Todd*:** more scissors, handkerchief in sleeve
* **Mad Hatter in *Alice in Wonderland*:** jacket and socks and ribbony things
* **Captain Jack Sparrow in *Pirates of the Caribbean*:** dreads and bandanna and double beards
* **Tonto in *Lone Ranger*:** crow and spurs (thanks /u/im_lost_at_sea and /u/matria801)
* **John Dillinger in *Public Enemies*:** sheriff badge/gun
* **Raoul Duke in *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*:** sunglasses, camera, and cigarette (thanks /u/pinskia, /u/MosTheBoss)
* **Frank Tupelo in *The Tourist*:** suit and bowtie
* **Willy Wonka in *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*:** pocket watch
* **Barnabas Collins in *Dark Shadows*:** claw fingers
* **George Jung in *Blow*:** shorter blonde hair?
* **Mort Rainey in *Secret Window*/Dean Corse in *Ninth Gate*:** book strapped to arm (thanks /u/the_cosmic_joke)
* **Rango in *Rango*:** badge (/u/MrGraveRisen)

Pretty cool...but am I the only one that thinks the out-of-focus girl in the background looks kinda unsettled by what she's seeing?  

Are the socks a reference to Benny & Joon?
The "forever burdened" aspect of Whats Eating Gilbert Grape is written in his 400 yard gaze, down the rabbit hole for this cosplayer.
"Romantic Johnny" a la Chocolat not present, good call
Where is Wonka?
It's telling that he still mostly resembles Jack Sparrow.
Where is the Ninth Gate reference?

EDIT: jOmni-Dep
A lot of people are saying Secret Window isn't represented but a big part of the plot was the cigarettes, Pall Malls. Depp kept saying he didn't smoke, but Shooter did. He cigarette could be Secret Window.

Bottom: Bill Gates, Andrea Lewis, Marla Wood, Paul Allen

Not everyone in the photo stayed with Microsoft, obviously. 

-Andrea Lewis became a fiction writer

-Maria Wood sued Microsoft 2 years after the photo was taken

-Bob O'Rear went on to be a cattle rancher

-Bob Greenberg left Microsoft to develop the Cabbage Patch Kids

less beards more money.

i wonder if correlation...
Which of them are not multi-millionaires, or billionaires now?
Better comparison would be photos of their personal transportation in 1978 (bicycle, bus pass, old Honda CVCC) versus today (McLaren P1, Ferrari 458, BMW 8-Series).
1978 Bill Gates looks like you might wake up in bed one night and find him chewing on your toe nails.

The wheels really spin, too.
Toronto has loads of cool street art, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/7qSxzyK.jpg?1) the only decent snapshot I got. If you live in the midwestern or the northeastern US, definitely make the trip. It's not too bad of a hike, relatively inexpensive, & the Parkdale/Ossington area (in particular) is *incredibly* cool. It's like someone rolled up the hippest northside districts in Chicago into one badass neighborhood.

My girlfriend & I went there for Valentine's day last year, completely unfamiliar with the city, & lucked into an Airbnb for $34 a night in the heart of Parkdale. Can't wait to go back!
Man, Toronto seems like a cool place. It's where my favorite TV show, Orphan Black, takes place. I've gotta visit some day.

Why are there so many 'flatiron' buildings like this? What was the advantage to this style of building?
I'm so confused right now. I don't know if the whole thing is flat and jut painted (including the brick columns and the illusion of the blanket as if it was over the facade), if the brick columns are real, if there is indeed a flat cardboard only everything on it (the nails and everything) is just painted, or if they actually peeled off the brick layer and this came out. Damn you talented artists, you have made me doubt reality again. 
wow that is some of the best Trompe-l'il I've ever seen and on that sort of scale too.

My mom used to try to paint certain things in the same style and it looked good but never to that extent
This is gorgeous. 
The gooderham building! interestingly it has a triangular shape and is older then the Flatiron in New York
I've been telling my wife that we should go to Toronto...

I worked the distillery district and was told that Gooderham and Worts  had and tunnels that reached the Gooderham building. They were used for smuggling during prohibition supposedly.

Legit question: 

How does lightning strike from a volcano cloud? I've only ever seen lightning in the clouds from the sky, before, so this is a new concept to me. 
How am I supposed to get all the way up there with just this stupid ring and my stupid midget buddies?


"Who disturbs my slumber?"
Shit like this is why ancient civilizations believed in cool gods.
OMG I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

Okay, fun fact about Venus, the atmosphere is to thick and hot for rain, so when it rains sulfuric acid on venus it evaporates a few km above the surface.

But there is lightning? Lightning on earth comes with rainstorms, but the lack of rainstorms on venus means that the lightning  comes from the volcanic ash buildup in the atmosphere.

I just like to imagine that there was some asshole doing a hiking trip and just as he was taking a selfie at the top of the volcano God decided to erupt it and strike him with lightning just to be sure.
Lol, stupid lightning.  It thinks it's a real cloud.

To be fair, [if you need a map of an American city you can also just use a waffle](http://imgur.com/HvON0On).
Sure it looks neat and tidy. Until you need to leave.

Then you realize that there are only three ways out, because the city is surrounded by water and no matter which cardinal direction you choose, the ass-to-nose traffic that suddenly engulfs you isn't just a rush hour crawl. No, poor traveler, you have joined the sad ranks of a standstill frozen in time since the Sonics played at the Kingdome and even now as you fidget with radio dial hoping to find a voice out there in the AM/FM wastelands who can tell you why the driver in front of you has given up on the brake pedal and shifted into park on an interstate that should be moving at a brisk 65 mph according to the sign just ahead that's been taunting you for, oh god, has it been 45 minutes, even now, as an infuriatingly chipper traffic correspondent is telling you to "get comfortable" because the city has whored out the same highway that just reopened after a 10 day construction closure to the Fifty Shades of Grey 2 film crew (this literally just happened), you have only just begun to appreciate the irony of stamping an image of the Seattle infrastructure on a metal pancake meant to cover up vast rivers of human shit.

My first thought was wow this could be a really good land art for MTG this could should get in contact with wizards and then I realized it was Noah Bradley so I guess it all makes sense. Love your work!
Well done. Have you also posted it to r/SpeculativeEvolution ?
Any chance this is Magic related? 
I like how you've used a few visual clues to suggest an entire mythology underlying the image. Most of this image is just a beautiful landscape, but the addition of a few strikingly peculiar rock formations implies magical forces at work and an alien sentience of some kind. The starry sky where we should find water or lowlands is very unsettling and makes me feel like this is a lonely place. It induces a kind of existential angst at the same time as the land above creates a kind of awe.

My animation teacher worked on the simposons as well! Where other teachers would draw a stick figure on the board to illustrate their point, he would always draw a perfect homer Simpson. Did you work with Brian Wells?
I see Homer is enjoying his ox testicle.
[From last year's trip](http://i.imgur.com/PSVxuJC.png)
I had one of the earlier animators for Simpsons work in my office for years a while back. He would draw some of the funniest pictures I've seen and leave them everywhere.
Doing small things like this can cause a surprisingly large amount of amazement. Things like these small hidden gems can make someone's entire week, even if you don't know it.
The key to making Homer look drunk it seems is to make his eyes point in slightly different directions.
2 years ago, he offered to "Simpsonise" people. Would he still be willing to do this with a picture of my daughter for me? I'd be eternally grateful!
Is this just your natural talent, or have you also had formal art education? 



Do you any original characters you have come up with? 



is there a rule against impromptu ama-ing someone? 
This is beyond awesome. Having an original drawing like that would surely embiggen the smallest man.

It's nice to see event he professionals starts off with the rudimentary circles break down before drawing in the details. [Fun fact, Marge's head and hair is exactly 3 equally sized circles tall.](http://i.imgur.com/Y28pW3C.jpg)
This pic just makes me really remember how way out of his league Marge is. 
I'm surprised you didn't go to the Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary. I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year.
I've never seen Homer's feet before. I didn't know it would look like elephant's feet.
My dad was an animator on the Simpsons! Do you know Tuck Tucker?


He also does little things like this. Most of his life he worked on Hey Arnold and Spongebob, so it's more often that he will be asked to draw one of those than a Simpson's character. He's from a small town in Virginia, so whenever we visit, everyone crowds him in public hoping for a personalized drawing. He's like a local celebrity! He also does little doodles for my roommates and friends for their birthdays. It's such a fun skill to have!
I wish I knew how to go be an animator,  it's my dream career. I live in the middle of nowhere and I feel like I can't leave.  
>doodle

What an understatement! 
You know, I'd really love it if Alex could Simpsonize me one time...Oh...Oh wait. 
Hey you!  This is awesome.
Thank fuck you're back. I have a ridiculous story and video to tell/show you. Only you will feel my pain. 
When I was about 11, I found that I could draw a really shitty Bart.  I proudly doodled him everywhere.  I would flip over paper place mats at restaurants and doodle Bart with a speech bubble saying things like "This place rocks!" or "Cowabunga dude!".  I strode out of those restaurants with just a little more kid swagger than I had before I could doodle Bart.
Marge keepin' it tight.
I remember my dad showing me a graphic artist named Alex Ruiz who he made a book for a couple years ago (company name is UBuildABook) , is this the same Alex Ruiz?
If they're smart they'll frame a copy. Nothing in a hotel is safe unless it's bolted down.
Homer, I can see your doodle.
Marge looks amazing in that bikini... Why am I jealous of a cartoon smh

What did she buy when you were born?
I have the exact same bear!

I got it a few minutes after I was born (I've been told). Soon to be 20 years old. I miss the fluffyness :/

Edit: Awesome to see that so many people have one! 
Bear on the left has seen things...
Lol. That is one loved teddy bear. 
It looks like your brother's teddy has had open heart surgery and a sex change.



[Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter](https://archive.org/stream/thevelveteenrabb11757gut/11757.txt)

I wonder if the second one was originally bought as a possible replacement in case the first one was lost/FUBARed
Is your brother [Mr. Burns?](http://m0.her.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bobo.jpg)
I dont know if this was a friend, uncle or a random post I saw but it was something similar, I believe it was a family tradition:

One of the husbands friends buys a bottle of booze of the same year the first baby was born, but cannot drink it. The father has to wait until the kid is old enough to drink or is finally mature.

[I vaguely remember a friend telling me his grandfather did this. 
Mexico,1952, a bottle of tequila and the eldest drinking with their father. The eldest (his aunt) is now the matriarch of the family]
Omg I have the same bear too! My mom gave it to me on my first Christmas in 1985. Here he is having a bath: http://imgur.com/7w9Dg72
And drying off: http://imgur.com/75Z8Y7l
I really hope my mother doesn't have a doppelbear around somewhere because she's going to be really disappointed when I never have children.
I don't want to know the horrors that bear went trough 
This is like looking at old and new pictures of Lindsay Lohan.

That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."

They are both [puffalumps](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IUPbfxSHL._SX300_.jpg), apparently of the mouse variety. Mine is named Little Rabbit, so it's surprising to learn as an adult that I never noticed the species mismatch.

That's some forward thinking on the part of your mom. It's an adorable idea.
That is awesome.  Before I deployed for the first time, my father gave me a strong manly hug, and reminded me not to be a hero.  My mom quietly gave me a small shopping bag with my bear in it.  She said that she'd feel better if I brought it with me, so I did.  My bear is a shellback, damnit.
Nice try Ted 2 marketing team.
Congrats! Being an uncle/aunt is a lot of fun. You get to spoil the kid without losing 6 months of sleep. Plus you can give them candy when your sibling says no, and your the cool one (a couple years down that road).

Holy shit my niece is almost 3... Time flies.
i'm kinda freaking out bc i have the same goddam bear and got it when i was a kid. i'm 30 yrs old now, any info on the tag or any more descriptors? this is mind blowing for me you just opened up a nostalgic memory forgotten for a couple of decades

how come the pictures look so soft?
Dumbass coming through. What's with all the "it's snowing on Mt. Fuji" comments?
I read this as "Japan in full boom"
I expected something else
[Source](https://500px.com/photo/105244145/fuji!-by-daniel-kordan) and /r/japanpics if you want to take a look.
For anyone feeling inspired to go to Japan, I've gone twice so let me make it concrete for ya.

**Flights:** Flights can be, at best, around 600 USD round trip. United ran a special for this cost. Often you'll find a round trip for about 1200 USD (this is my experience flying from SFO in the bay area). Use [itasoftware](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) to search for flights. Also google around for deals.

Alternatively, look into acquiring mileage points through credit card usage and flying for free. 

**Room:** On my second visit I stayed in a hostel called [Khaosan Kabuki](http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/en/kabuki/) for about 35 a night. You can get free room if you volunteer to clean. 

Many hostels are similarly priced / have similar volunteer benefits. 

Let me clarify that a "hostel" is not as shady as it connotes. The place I stayed was as clean as any hotel I've been to.

Capsule Hotels are also cheap and somewhat of an experience. 

**Food:** Food in Japan is like food anywhere. There's cheap stuff (less than 10) decent stuff (10-25) and expensive (30-100's). 

You can have a very enjoyable trip eating for less than 10 a meal although I suggest splurging once or twice because Japan does have amazing food to offer. The best value / quality for sushi I've heard of and had myself is a place called [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/index.html).

There's no tipping either which is amazing as I'm from the U.S. and any $10 meal was actually $10.

**Sights / Activities:** This is far more flexible depending on the kind of person you are. I spent most of my time walking around which is free.  I recommend at least 1 planned activity that's unique to Japan and new to you (Karaoke, Onsen, traditional breakfast, etc). 

**Language Barrier:** Japanese people are some of the most courteous and kind people in the world. Culture reasons. One of the things that stands out on my first trip was a mob of people *standing on the right side of an escalator and letting walkers through on the left. No one broke this rule.* 

English is pretty prevalent in Japan, especially the cities. In fact there's a Starbucks in the Shibuya Crossing which is a hugely popular spot and a KFC nearby. Western influence abounds.

People are mostly happy to try and communicate with you. But yes, it's scary to engage with someone who doesn't speak your language. 

**Story Time:** I was with my friend Matt (who had actually just finished traveling east from Florida... long way around the world). We had a "sushi day" where we decided to get expensive sushi lunch and dinner in the same day.

For lunch, we visited [Kyubei](http://www.kyubey.jp/). Our reservation was made by our Hostel staff (which is something they are always willing to help with). I'm assuming they acknowledged we were English speaking and we were sat with a chef who spoke enough English. 

For dinner, we visited the [highest-rated sushi place on Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066854-d1692134-Reviews-Sushiryori_Inose-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html). After an awesome sushi course, we were sitting alone in their shop. It was cold outside. The sushi chef spoke "O-sake?" offering us some sake. 

Well, we ended up sitting with them for almost two more hours drinking sake and bumbling our way through communication. I learned their son is a model in magazines. They pulled out a giant map of the world and my friend Matt showed them where he had been. They like California Cabernet wine. The wife played some Michael Jackson on her phone and did an impersonation. 

Points here are that people want to connect with you and Japan is pretty accepting of English.

We even had a bus driver yelling at us on a bus full of Japanese passengers. Turns out we missed our stop (I had mentioned it to him before getting on). He literally stopped the bus, motioned for us to get out, and pointed us in the right direction. It was embarrassing and stressful unlike the previous sushi dinners. Point here is that there will be moments where it's not roses.

---

All in all you could do Japan on 2k easily. If you pull a flight deal or a free flight through miles it'll be even cheaper.
Ok, I will be that guy.

WTF is going on with the ladder. 

It looks like somebody was fixing the roof and just said. "Fuck it, I will just leave this here."

This is a gorgeous picture.  The only times I've visited locations like this have been in video games, and I always love it.

Gorgeous! The cherry blossoms are in full bloom right now in DC as well. Thanks, Japan!

I used to help a breeder with raising Lories. They are beautiful birds that make fantastic pets; very smart and extremely companionable. They can be messy though because they prefer nectar and fruit for food.   
  
My favorites are the Rainbow Lorikeet and Cardinal Lory. 
These are literally the most beautiful birds I have ever seen.
Lories and lorikeets can all go fuck themselves. They are all evil and seem to take joy in hurting you and their own kind. I've been working with them for seven years and take my word for it. They suck.

SNEAK PEAK of gorgeous Pluto! The dwarf planet has sent a love note back to Earth via our New Horizons spacecraft, which has traveled more than 9 years and 3+ billion miles. This is the last and most detailed image of Pluto sent to Earth before the moment of closest approach - 7:49 a.m. EDT today. This same image will be released and discussed at 8 a.m. EDT today. Watch our briefing live on NASA Television at: http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv The high res pic will be posted on the web at: http://www.nasa.gov. 
This stunning image of the dwarf planet was captured from New Horizons at about 4 p.m. EDT on July 13, about 16 hours before the moment of closest approach. The spacecraft was 476,000 miles (766,000 kilometers) from the surface.

I know we do this all the time, but is anyone fucking blown away by how we can just shoot this high powered camera out into space and have it arrive at the exact location that we planned a DECADE in advance?

Seriously, that's so fucking cool. 
Just throwing this out there... There is an actual silhouette of Pluto the dog in this image: http://i.imgur.com/ZPu6Ggv.jpg 

Scientifically unimportant, but pretty cool.
Remember when it [chased Indiana Jones](http://i.imgur.com/H783RKM.jpg)?
When this mission launched, I was a starry-eyed teenager who had no idea how she was expected to wait until 2015 for Pluto images.  Today, I took a break from my normal PhD astronomy research to hit up the institute's Pluto party and do an interview for Dutch national TV on the topic.  Life takes us in strange directions!

Amazing fact to me #1: the images that we will get later tonight and over the next year will be up to 50 times closer than this one!  I can't wait to see more detailed pictures of that smooth heart, it almost looks like a giant sand dune or something!

Amazing fact to me #2, by the way, is thinking that there's a good chance this will be *the* Pluto image for textbooks and the like that I will see for the rest of my life.  That thought is somehow astounding to me.

So cool. To think the probe took off in 2006.
Probably a dumb question, but why are planets so perfectly round, as opposed to other space objects like meteors?
Pluto reminding us that it still loves us, even after we said it couldn't be a planet anymore.
I can't help but wonder what the reaction would be if we ended up seeing obvious signs of infrastructure from the detailed image.
You can see the silhouette of Pluto on Pluto. 
Can you imagine if you saw a spaceship there? Like some structure. 
I call bullshit.

That's a whopper with the chocolate sucked off.

Edit: Actually, think it's just an upscale done by businessinsider.com
I like that because of its color it looks like an old photo from the 20's, what makes this even more awesome is that I'm a Lovecraft fan. 
I showed my girlfriend this and she said "oh look, Pluto has a heart."
This is real. This exists. And we photographed it.
I find it mind blowing.
Can someone explain to me how they can get a picture of this millions of miles away but I can't get cell service if I'm in the wrong part of town.  Seriously I want to know how it works.
"Dear NASA, Your mom thought I was big enough."

Man this is so awesome.  Rarely does something happen where you know you're witnessing history, but this is it! 
That shape used to be a perfect heart. It broke after we stopped calling Pluto a planet.
Dude I can see the great Wall of China from here.

When i zoom way in on mobile, it kind of looks like she has a Charlie Chaplain mustache. 
[Without girl for scale it looks like macro photo of aquarium or very small backwater puddle.](http://i.imgur.com/0oRu0px.jpg)
In november i watched a hump back whale and calf swimming around the cove just round the point from here.  We camp up near the clifftop about 50m from the spot this photo was taken at same time each year.  This year we set up a projector and big screen at the camp site and watched flash gordon while getting outrageously drunk!! Good times! !
Welcome to the land that's way under, down under, the sky's always yellow in rain or shine...

"Don't dream it.... be it"
Ahh, the bay of fires. Amazing place.
i like the title...in Tassie you can relax and pics like this stop you from taking this great place for granted.
Can someone photoshop a hideous monster beaneth her, about to attack?
I don't know if you should give coordinates to a dead body. Also that looks like some seriously huge crab in the bottom left

Cannonballlllll
What's tasmania like to live in? Is its economy as strong as mainland Australia? How cold does it get? Do I want to live there? Does that woman come with the visa? Will batman get to Mary beth in time to save her from the evil doctor Chocula?

Now that this has been tagged as Cliched/Unoriginal, which I am not going to oppose, do I get a second chance to change it or has I forever been marked a cliche?
She's getting all types of dead. Well judging by her floatiness she already got super dead.
I think I know her 
Can someone edit this into a gif where the black seaweed closes in on her like its an evil thing? That would be great for thelassophobia!
Google Street View is being really thorough. 
Meanwhile? What else is going on at the moment?

Here's what it looks like without being edited all to hell (taken by me last summer):

And here's what it looks like from the glacier overlook back down:

(photos completely unedited, taken on an iPhone).  Glacier is so stupidly beautiful it's just ridiculous.

Edit: If we're doing Glacier pics, these are a few of my favorites

It looks like that two, maybe three months out of the year. Many parts of the park are closed between October and May.

Montana has 4 seasons; June, July, August & Winter.
Happy Montana day!!!!!!!!!!!  4 06  :>

Montana, and a shit ton of saturation.
I would like to live in Montana. And marry a round American woman. And raise rabbits, and have her cook them for me.

This is from Glacier NP.  This picture was taken from the hike to grinnell glacier!  It's my all-time #1 hike.  Would recommend to everyone, if given the opportunity.
Montana? Fuck traveling the world, I'll travel America. 
Montana doesnt actually look this good. Dont come here.
don't post this kinda shit here. last thing we need is all the fuckin yahoos from the east coast and california showin up. let all them assholes go to colorado.
[I attempted to undo the filters and bring saturation down to something reasonable](http://i.imgur.com/xDbqOs8.jpg), it's actually a nice photo under all the crap.
It's a terrible place. Don't ever go there. Bad bad things.
Please ignore this post, Montana is full of ranchfolk, guns, cows, and cheatgrass. Very uncomfortable place-at least 2 feet of snow on the ground for 9 months and 3 months of straight up jungle heat... I hear Wyoming has plenty of room. 
Gosh those purple rocks sure seem odd...
*Western* Montana. 

Easter Montana is a lot flatter, browner, and has quite a few more oil pumps. 
Upvote for Montana.
I drove through western Montana last May, it is  very beautiful. 
Movin' to Montana soon
Gonna be a dental floss tycoon
Okay, so seriously montana is beautiful. Just fucking stop showing the whole world, alright?
Another gorgeous area of Montana around the Beartooth Highway (~10k elevation).

This is practically Canada, go to Canada...
I moved to Bozeman from Cincinnati while back ago and I fell in Love. Completely in Love. Will never move back to the mid-west or east.
Wow that is really beautiful. Not sure why but ever since I was a kid I've always had this thing in the back of my head saying "go to Montana"
hooooly shit. where is this? (don't say Montana)
Pillow.
