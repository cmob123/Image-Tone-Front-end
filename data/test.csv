He died protecting priceless antiquities from destruction, something he definitely believed in.  Sad for him to die but certainly honorable for him to die with his convictions.The man was 82 years old and brave as fuck. RIP.This is so heartbreaking. His love for the Palmyra Antiquities surpassed his love for his own life.

I hope that wherever he goes, he's rolling in antiquities and unbelievable treasures.  Here's a story. 

The New York Times: ISIS Beheads Syrian Antiquities Scholar. http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5JqtgyU...why can't the entire world be more successful against ISIS... the news about them is always so frustrating and infuriatingIt breaks my heart so much history is being destroyed. Especially since that area (Iraq, Iran, etc) is literally like the cradle of civilization and there's SO MUCH priceless stuff there. It's truly a terrible thing.When you feel threatened by ancient monuments, dead gods and archeologists, you're in the wrong and so is your ideology.[This is Tomislav Salopek, 31, father of two, Croatian] (http://static.klix.ba/media/images/vijesti/b_150813104.jpg), beheaded by ISIS a week ago, because, well, ISIS likes to behead peopleRIP Khaled Assad. You died a more honorable man than those who killed you. Thank you khaled. You're a hero to history.Most news stories failed to say why he was murdered. The man was a hero who sacrificed himself to protect his lifetime of work. 

It's long passed time for the surrounding Muslim countries, who have millions of soldiers in their armies, to come together and put an end to these monsters once and for all.  I know Isis are shitheads but why do they destroy ancient buildings and antiques?R.I.P. man of ethics and morality.Perhaps some of the powerful sovereigns in regions **SHOULD STEP THE FUCK UP** and save their culture and history before it's wiped out by these assholes.


It's hard for me to be upset about this anymore.

I'm absolutely shocked at the loss of priceless history and the barbarism to kill this man over this, but if no one in the Middle East wants to stop ISIS, then I say the West should pull out, and let them have their cake.

There's no way we, with a foreign modern military, can go into a region like the Middle East and solve these problems by killing people.

Our foreign military can support and assist in a force led by a local sovereign, but we cannot lead a war over there and come out the winner, nor accomplish anything effective.

People have the right to self determination. If those people in the territory now controlled by ISIS, and those sovereigns around them want to allow ISIS sovereign control, so be it.**NEW GAME:** No more need to hunt and kill secondary game like lions and rhinos.  It's time to drop all of the poachers into ISIS territory armed to the teeth and wearing GoPros with instructions to bring back their heads as trophies.  Poach for your life baby!Fuck You ISIS!Wow.

RIP.As a historian I am really feeling that it is time for us to organize and begin seriously defending these sites. This man died with honor. I hope he finds peace. Will somebody plz take out those piece of shit fucktards? I hope if I ever face my own death like that I can have half the balls this guy did and tell them fuck right off. This guy is a hero and died as honorable a death as any man could hope for, die protecting and defending what you love and lived for.I was talking with a lot of redditors yesterday trying to understand how ISIS is able to recruit and hold so much control if seemingly no one supports them. 

The common answer from Muslims was that ""more Muslims support ISIS than are willing to admit it publicly"".  And that ""even if they don't actively support them, they tacitly support them by secretly agreeing with their actions"". 

That was concerning to me, and as much as I hate to agree with GW Bush, I can kind of start to see the logic of his ""If you aren't with us, you're against us"" comment. 

Seeing people like this man, get beheaded for such a noble cause kind of highlights for me how terribly evil this group is.  If you even *remotely* support what these people are doing, fuck you. 

This truly is a point in time where everyone needs to clearly pick a side. This is the kind of shit that we as a society can't tolerate. I guess real life is not like a movie. I wonder if he spent his last seconds wondering if someone would come to save him. I hate when good people have to die like this. fucking savages

RIP, real manAlpha as Fuck. ISIS - Tell us where you have the shit hid. Kahled - Fuck You.
I hope that I would have the Balls to protect my life's work.It's tragic that it often takes such villains to show us who the heroes are.

I have similar windows right next to my desk, every day a female cardinal lands on the window sill and looks at herself for several minutes, sometimes pecking at her image.  Usually the male eventually sees her and starts singing at her until she turns and they fly off.   I always imagine him yelling ""C'mon, you look fine!, We have to go, we're going to be late!""
We never got deer, but we definitely got a lot of people stopping to fix their hair, a few fixing makeup and one muscly asian guy who danced while staring at himself for about five minutes.

Probably the best and cruelest use of it was gluing a coin to the pavement.They suck when geese or swans nest by them, the dumb things see their reflections and think that it's a rival, and peck at the windows.

We have the same windows around the building I work at. A deer charged at the glass and broke through.

He would peck his reflection for hours and hours every day for weeks.My grandparents used to have a house in Tucson with one-way windows. Every morning we would wake up to a family of quails banging their heads against the window, I assume to beat up the other, identical family of quails who were invading their turf.

Quails are not so smart.[deleted]I worked in my university's print shop full-time, sweet deal, free tuition and they let me leave for three hours each day, with pay, to attend one class plus I was on campus for the evening class as well.  Anyway, our print shop was mostly underground but had these windows where you could look up to the sidewalk.  There was a railing just above and a lot of students would lean on the railing.  I had six student aides working for me and Jesus Christ did they ever stare up the skirts through that window all damn day.  I never did because I'm just not that type of guy.  I ended up taping cardboard over the windows between semesters so the next batch of aides didn't know any better, but sure enough those guys had already heard about the perk and tore down my cardboard.Expected two hobos fucking.  Was pleasantly surprised.Its great until someone stores their dildo against the window.That ain't no deer I ever seen. Where is this?

EDIT: First video taken down, [here is the video i was talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbvZNy7Bmw)I worry more about airborne debris than I do about a pressure wave.    My dad was a maintenance foreman at a refinery for many years.  They had just got on site when a grain elevator about 3/4 mile away exploded.  Not your normal little sheet metal silo, but a huge concrete structure on the ship channel.  They saw it go and could feel the heat on their skin.  One of dad's crew yelled ""Take cover!"" and they scuttled behind the cracking tower they were going to work on that day.  Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet.How deep does it go?So does anyone know why caused that massive explosion? Knowing my luck, i bet those tar filters i ordered from China last week were in one of those shipping containers.Only 50 people died? How many were vaporized?is there a before picture?That was the largest explosion I've seen that isn't a nuke.  I don't even think a MOAB is that big.To give you another unbelievable indication of the explosions scale, here is a ""before"" picture of the exact area affected from Google Earth.  The red circle is the now water-filled crater, the yellow is the area substantially destroyed by the blast.

http://i.imgur.com/JvmXti5.jpg

It kind of looks like the crater is filled with water --does anyone know? It's difficult to see the depth of the crater.Thank God the explosion happened in that giant craterIs that how it's going to be remembered from now on?  The Tianjin Crater.  Just level the ground around it and abandon the land or turn it into a park of something.  

I lived close by to a massive explosion that happened in Quebec.  [The McMasterville Explosion 1975](http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/faits_divers/clips/12049/).  That too made a huge crater in the ground and levelled an entire factory complex that belonged to CIL.  The remaining factory was demolished and scrapped.  [You can see for yourself the land has been abandoned to this very day.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/McMasterville,+QC/@45.5403273,-73.2314636,720m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cc9aa8c356f3055:0xadd1c7a969a383e4!6m1!1e1)  It's not a farm, the land is too saturated with chemical toxins.  It's not a dump because the toxins make it too dangerous to work in.  It's just fenced off abandoned land.    This is a [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&rem=&zm=15) to the ever-useful ""NukeMap"" website that shows the estimated crater and fireball size for a 3kT blast at the site.  

Same [test](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&fallout=1&zm=15), but with the fallout and radiation settings on.   

Edit:  Here is a third [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=0.02&lat=39.0388145&lng=117.7362823&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&casualties=1&humanitarian=1&rem=&zm=18), this time with a blast setting of 0.02kT, which I am being told is the more accurate value than the 3kT value that I grabbed from earlier in this thread.   (NukeMap uses google API, so you can switch to satellelite view and drag the point of impact around to compare.)It really does look like the aftermath of some type of nuclear fallout. Scary stuff.from Wikipedia:

>Chinese state media reported that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics,[5] a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.[3]

 

>The first to respond to the fire were unable to keep it from spreading. The Global Times reported that firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water, as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in chain more violent chemical reactions.
 
 


How can the local Fire Fighters not have a different procedure for dealing with a fire at this facility?[Interactive before and after photos](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-14/before-after-tianjin-explosions/6697396).

I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. ""I'm afraid of swings"" he responds. ""Why"" his friend asks, ""did you have an accident while you were young?"" ""No!"" he exclaimed, ""I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing"". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, ""look how high I can go!"". 

Did that happen? probably not. 
Was there any point to that story? Nope!
 But did you read it? Well, only *you* can answer that question!Why am I only seeing Luigis?I always try to do this when I pass by a park.

EDIT: Okay, now I'm awake and sober, and can asses what I have done. The set isn't really that valuable, and I got it as part of a massive 390 set haul last year. I kept it for its historical value. The pieces are bagged in the perforated bags from back in the day, and they make that distinctive sound when you shake them. I love that sound. All I did was cut one of the seals to open it, and I don't regret it. This set is a time capsule and should be opened to see that booklet.
  
EDIT: The pictures of my Lego room were pretty old. Here's my room as of today. http://imgur.com/a/MrlX1[A helpful guide to picking out toys for kids](http://i.imgur.com/tcCnOdV.jpg).SPACESHIP?!??!!??Wish my parents had gotten this memo.  :(  All I wanted was legos and hot wheels and all I got were barbies.Source, but in German:

This is an English version of the 1974 German pamphlet found [here](http://www.redshift.com/~shifflett/lego/German_catalog_1974/). The English cover with the blonde girl can be seen [here](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?C=c74ukhom). The blurry numbers on the bottom match: 97880-Eng. This seems to be associated with the 1970s Lego Homemaker sets, which were Lego's first sets aimed at girls.

Other details: Although the matching German page is the third photo in the link, the position of the staple [confirms it is the back page](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2n1t47/70s_lego_had_the_right_idea/cm9o9wi?context=3). I am still unsure of the ""white house"" that OP mentioned, but perhaps he can corroborate the rest of this.

Edit to add: I found the [Portuguese version](https://plus.google.com/photos/+Blastemes/albums/5668495571434629281?banner=pwa), with [relevant translation of the ""To Parents"" letter.](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/a%20necessidade%20de%20criar%20e%20igualmente%20forte%20em%20todas%20criancas.%20rapazes%20ou%20raparigas.%20o%20que%20interessa%20e%20a%20imaginacao.%20a%20habilidade%20e%20a%20tecnica%20nao%20contam.%20Pode-se%20construir%20o%20que%20se%20tem%20na%20ideia.%20uma%20cama%20ou%20em%20camiao.%20uma%20casa%20de%20boneca%20ou%20uma%20nave%20espacial.%20%0A%0AMuitos%20rapazs%20preferem%20as%20casas%20de%20boneca.%20no%20fim%20de%20contas%20ha%20mais%20pessoas%20do%20que%20astronautas.%20uma%20boa%20parte%20das%20meninas%20prefere%20as%20naves%20espaciais.%20Sao%20mais%20excitantes%20do%20que%20as%20cases%20do%20boneca.%20O%20importante%20e%20porlhes%20ao%20alcance%20o%20material%20exacto.%20so%20assim%20elas%20poderao%20criar.) 
Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this. A Lego designer explains how the company survived: http://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1x6ldp/lego_franchise_infographic/cf8vdl3

Edit: You know, I'm really tired of older former Lego builders claiming Lego didn't produce pre-packaged sets with instructions in ""the good old days."" Unless your ""good old days"" were prior to 1978, those sets you sniff at, the ones that told you how to build spaceships with special parts? They were around: http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/year-1978 

Edit 2: Corrected the first link. http://i.imgur.com/afnTUMC.gifThis sucks balls. I tried to enter a Lego building competition at a local mall. I was a skinny little kid with long blonde hair. They told me that ""girls weren't allowed to enter"". I'm still emotionally damaged from that one, cos I was a Lego master.I'm a girl...and I wanted pink Legos. Why didn't they have pink Legos when I was a kid? Why is that so hard? Can anyone else make out what's written [on the back of the sheet](http://i.imgur.com/y5yLayE.png)?  

All I can make out is:

Greek student here. If anyone's interested, here's who they are. I should note, however, that the separate divisions of the muses weren't agreed upon till the end of antiquity.

In the center is Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. I'm assuming she's in the middle because they considered epic the highest poetic genre. Below her in the bottom right corner, Cleo, the muse of history. To the left, Urania, muse of astronomy. Then Polyhymnia, the muse of sacred poetry. Then Erato, muse of lyric poetry, specifically love poetry (her name is related to the word ""erotic""). Then Terpsichore, muse of dance and the chorus. Then Melpomene, muse of tragedy. Then Thalia, muse of comedy.  Then Euterpe, muse of elegiac poetry.
It looks like it was buried under white pumice from a volcanic eruption.

>The ancient city of Zeugma was originally founded as a Greek settlement by Seleucus I Nicator, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, in 300 BC. The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000 inhabitants.

http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/11/11/mosaics-revealed-at-ancient-greek-city-of-zeugma-in-turkey/I'm surprised by all the sediment/ (for the lack of a better word) stuff that ended up on top of it over the years. Although I know 2,000 years, plus or minus half a millennium, is a lot of time for the accumulation of sediment/stuff to take place, I didn't realize several feet/ meters could pile up that fast. [Touched it up a bit.](http://imgur.com/Z4SbgUO)It makes me so happy to know there are still things in the world to be discovered.I was excited when i tore up a carpet and found a hardwood floor. Now i know that was bush league.Wow, can't imagine the feeling you must get discovering this yourself. HOW CAN IT BE GREEK IF ITS IN TURKEY IM ONTO YOU LIBERALS DONT TRY TO PLAY ME I KNEW A MAPPLEASE dont let ISIS find it...

Edit: ok, folks, I'm not a novice when it comes to geography, history and current events.   I said that because ISIS is right across the border on Syria, and heaven forbid, they make their way into Turkey somehow.   We see Russians in the Ukraine so why is spillover totally impossible?  I mean no offense to Muslims in general, but ISIS has history of destroying works of art, monuments and historical sites in towns it makes a home in.   Man, reddit, you are fickle and easy to insult a total stranger.   First time I've been called a ""knuckle dragging mouth breather"".

Edit #2:  Alright, let me justify the comment/joke behind what I said.  Current (2 week old information) shows that [ISIS holds the boarder area of Turkey in Syria and the northern end of Iraq.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0).  [That's about 25 miles/40 km](http://imgur.com/E1PqDqE) to the site where that mosaic is being uncovered...Not really far.  Of course its a stretch to say ISIS will invade Turkey anytime soon.  But sheesh man, they're right there at the doorstep.  Chill out people.This will probably get buried but I work for the Biblical Archaeology Society and we did a short piece on this last week. This is from Zeugma, an ancient trading center that was the only point traders and travelers could cross the Euphrates. The name literally means ""bridge"". In the 90s turkey built a dam farther down the river and submerged 30% of the site underwater. They've been excavating since 2000 and this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. I think it's worth pointing out that these mosaics actually date to the 2nd or 3rd cent. A.D., so at a glance, they are about 1,750 to 1,850 years old, rather than 2,200, as has been reported in the media.
([Here is a good source](http://www.ccaroma.org/en/zeugma-conservation-mosaics) for more reliable info, if anyone's interested.)

There were definitely some very stunning and intricate polychrome mosaics in the Hellenistic period; it might even be considered the height of the craft.  But there are some stylistic differences that set the later mosaics apart.  That includes things like the heavy borders, the interlocking geometric patterns, the use of large(-ish) tesserae, the heavily rounded and shaded facial features, etc.
You can compare them, for example, to [these other 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics](http://followinghadrian.com/2014/10/15/roman-mosaics-from-the-national-archaeological-museum-of-spain-madrid/) from Spain.

Interestingly, it's thought that the interlocking geometric 'panel' designs in some mosaics might have been designed to imitate the elaborate panelling of the ceilings in the rooms where they were laid.

Gorgeous mosaics!  So nice to see that they've been spared the flooding that's overtaken so much of the site.

[Edit]  P.S. Also note some of the qualities I listed for 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics are common to Hellenistic mosaics, too (compare the Zeugma pavements to the [Alexander Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#mediaviewer/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) from Pompeii, for example (ca. 100 B.C.).  An art historian can probably add to this better than I can, but some of the differences are kind of ineffable to pin down.Oh man, crosspost over to /r/AncientCivilizations, they'd love this!They used sealer.awesomeIn Gaziantep, the closest major city to the archeological site, there's a state of the art ""mosaic museum"" that showcases finds from Zeugma. 

I was there a few months ago and had a blast. Southeastern Turkey is completely safe and refreshingly light on on other tourists, making you the recipient of a lot of warm hospitality from the locals.

It's just begging to be done.10 years later: ""Dad, why do I have a 4 point scar in my back?""Does bringing a child into the world automatically bestow a person with perfect balance? Seriously. I see moms/dads balancing a baby in one hand at my job, and groceries + a toddler in the other, like no big deal. I can't even carry a full cup of coffee. WHAT IS THE DEAL, PARENTS.Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. 

One daddy to another: please consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradle them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could get any sleep. 

If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. 

Also: take naps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing. Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. 

After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause both of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your wife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. 

Make sure you have infant Tylenol, baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infants, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all times* when you leave the house with the baby. 

You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. 

Keep a cloth diaper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed for work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the diaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean driveway. 

And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or professional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all just stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.

EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommending baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash cream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner ""<name of baby> has a rash on his/her ash"", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of being a daddy and you might as well get used to it now. id be scared shitless of dropping the baby, trying to catch it, forgetting i was holding a fork, and then stabbing the baby mid drop.A little bit of Velcro and you're ready for an infomercial.[deleted]My daughter used to be like this. Sleeping like a lazy leopard puts pressure on her tummy and lets the wind out. Try burping her for a bit longer after a feed, or massage her tummy, 20 circular rubs (clockwise to help digestion).

Also, I once saw a woman breastfeed both of her twins at once, whilst chowing down on a big ham sandwich. I was very impressed!I usually carry them the opposite way (because head is heavier than butt and it simply feels safer). http://imgur.com/f3Lt5I'm a Mom/Baby nurse.  The first week is definitely the worst.  Baby is programmed to eat every hour or two, mom's milk supply isn't entirely in yet, and you are so sleep-deprived you'd smack your mama in the face to get a 2-hour nap.  It will get better.  I admire your ingenuity.And people say men can't multitask!Try eating with a 32lb 1.5 year old on your left arm, and a 36 lb 3.5 year old on your right arm.  You have to depend on them to feed you properly, in this case.  So once they stop fighting each other, maybe they'll feed daddy.  

BTW, how do you fathers of multiple children deal with , say one is 1.5 years old, barely understanding things, but quite feisty.  Doesn't understand that the 3.5 year old has his toys that she cant touch.  But she doesn't understand this yet.  She only knows to give it back to him when he starts crying for it.  But he gets impatient and starts sacking her, at that point she will refuse to give it back and fight back.... how do I end this????  should i?  should I make him share? 

I've been telling my older son to give her one of her own toys whenever she wants to take one of his.  Or to trade for something he's not using doesn't want..  But he's still very possessive of his own toys.  Glad you weren't hungry for hot soup.My son is the same, only fall a sleep when i carry him on my arm.
Pro tip: Turn the baby around. Keep her shoulder as high up on your arm as you can (by the elbow, where her bum is now in the picture, or even higher up). 
This will be easier for you as all her weight is really in her head, and when she gets heavier you will feel the difference. 
Also it's safer (in my opinion). You can hold her thigh real easy with your hand. Instead of her head, so if she moves you won't have to stress her neck. 
Check this image: http://i.imgur.com/U3tm5.png
See how he holds the thigh? thats the secret to it beeing really comfortable, since you can have your other hand kinda free.
It's recommended that you put your other hand ontop of the child any way, but when you feel you got the hang of it. Youll notice how good it feels.Have you thought of swaddling? works like a charm for little babies. I had preemie twins and it was a life saver.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSYPqGtFBYQDon't let her get used to that bro, she'll end up one of those girls you can eat sushi off of...Man, I haven't laughed at a photo like that in the longest time. She looks like an awesome little chipmunk and I'm sure she'll appreciate you rocking that pic at her 21st birthday party. Congrats man.

A real man is not defined by macho bull shit.  A real man is a man who puts the needs of his children and family before his own.  The sacrificial man. I didn't figure this out until I had children of my own.

It is the innocence of children that forges a mans true strength. But I didn't need to say it. It is clear from the photo that you already understand.

Was it posted?  We occasionally get deaths from people entering the glacial ice caves here in Washington.[deleted]Kinda depressing story ...

When I was 16 I went on an Alaskan cruise.  I got food poisoning and was in bed or throwing up through most of the trip, but I was well enough to watch the cruise through and past a whole bunch of glaciers next to each other.  One after the other.  It was amazing.  It felt like they were SO close to me and the ship.  Totally amazing seeing them all dead end into a big body of water.

So this year I went on the same kind of cruise again.  I'm 31 now and decided it was time to go and not get deathly ill.  It was a great cruise this time, but when it came to cruise past those VERY SAME glaciers ... they were almost gone.  They had receded SO FAR back up the mountains that we were hardly able to get close to them at all.  I had to use my binoculars just to see the detail I was able to see just looking out a window last cruise.  

The amount of melting, just in the short 15 years I had been there last, was SO fucking depressing to me.

tl;dr:  Went to Alaska 15 years apart.  Glaciers are disappearing.  We're fucked as a species.In the years to come when this is reposted kids will ask ""what's a glacier?""This image reminds me of a documentary of Inuit mussel-gatherers waiting for the sea ice to drop so they can break through the ice and harvest mussels before the sea rises again. Here's the documentary by BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMZYDQ6v24How thick is the ice above you? Seems like sunlight can get throughI now realize if Superman had his ice fortress it would have melted by now.

GG global warming GGThat looks incredible OPI saw the picture and said ""whoa"" out loud.  This is /r/whoahdude  worthy.I wonder how the water tastes.Light blue helmet looks very happy :)Is that Mendenhall Glacier?That is so fucking cool and so fucking scary at the same time.That's a bit clumsy of you. They're huge!How dangerous is that? I went camping at some ice caves a few years back (not inside, just near them) and there were signs everywhere saying to not go in them and if you do to not make any noise in them. In fact, a few months back a person was killed and some injured due to back to back collapses in a matter of days.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlDxgo-L7DMLook out for Falmer.I remember a geology professor explicitly telling us how incredibly dangerous hiking ""into"" a glacier isHow dangerous is that? I mean, if they're receding so quickly, they'd be weak and thin, no? But thin for a glacier is much more than enough to fall and kill someone.  I didn't even know you could do that.

Pervert frog is watching you.[deleted]I never would have guessed that a cute picture of a frog could hide such a shitstorm of OP-hating and drama. I wish I had an awesome shower frog :/He keeps the bugs down. I like it.Oh man, frogs are kickass. I remember when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old, me and a friend made some traps out of plastic bottles. We caught around 20 frogs and one trout in a single day. Ended up digging an old aquarium out of the basement and putting them in that. Made a lot of land space with aquarium sand, had a little watery bit and put the trout in there. Only problem was that my room didn't have enough space, so I had to put it in my 3 year old sisters room. Turns out frogs can jump *(Who knew)*, and will do so if put in a shitty aquarium. I awoke to the sound of my little sister laughing like a maniac and my mother flipping shit. Ran in to see the room, including my little sisters crib fucking covered in frogs. God damn that was hilarious. Then my mother found the trout. More shit was flipped, and I had to set the frogs, and the god damn motherfucking trout free in our garden. **I released a motherfucking trout into the natural fucking habitat of my god damn front lawn!** He had it coming though, that trout was a dick. Smug bastard. Watching 20 something frogs, and one trout jump around on the lawn was good fun. Me and that friend ended up having a lot of fun with frogs and trouts that summer.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, take good care of that frog, he might very well save your life one day. Oh, and trouts are dicks.He has licked your toothbrushI have never seen a group of people so concerned on the states of someone's else's shower in which they will never be. I think it's really cool that you have a little amphibian buddy in there, but the people who are bothered by him being near your toothbrush are right - frogs can carry salmonella and other germs that you don't want to get in your mouth.I like frogs a lot, he's pretty cute.  I can't help thinking he'd be happier outside.He doesn't bother you, but I bet he bothers all over your toothbrush.Frogs, like other reptiles and amphibians, can have salmonella on their skin.  Right next to your toothbrush *might* not be be the safest place to let him chill.I've got quite a few of this same species of frog living on my property (like OP, I'm also in Florida) and about two years ago we had a record breaking cold winter night. It pretty much devastated all of my tropical plants and killed dozens of these little guys. They were strewn about my property like little frozen frogsicles.

Anyway, that same morning I woke up to a frog swimming around my toilet. I had no idea how it got in there, but I calmly escorted him out of the house. On my way back in my wife shrieked, ""there's a frog in the toilet!"" To which I replied that I already got him out. But clearly I didn't because, sure enough, there was a frog in the toilet. And then another and another and another...

All told, there were around 20 frogs in the toilet itself and the pipes leading to it. According to the plumber who was hired to get them out, they crawled in there for warmth (and probably did so through the vent). It was one of the most bizarre things I'd ever experienced but the plumber disagreed, ""Nothing peculiar about it. Just got some frogs in your toilet.""

Gotta love Florida.you're gonna be pissed as fuck when he turns out to be a she and shits frog spawn all over your shower. Pissed As Fuck.
Who cares if the room is covered in lime? People shit in there anyway. There's a difference between being dirty and being old and lived in. Sorry we can't all live in the four seasons.

Here's an excellent explanation from NASA:

http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/30may_solareclipse2/

> ""Solar images formed by pinholes, crossed fingers, patches between leaves, all occur because of diffraction--a wave property of light. In the case of a pinhole, the light rays do not shoot straight by the rim of the hole, but bend around the edge. This wave effect creates a diffraction pattern of rings on the screen which resembles a bull's eye. That's for a flat wave single light source. If the aperture is illuminated by a scene, it acts as a lens to image the scene on a screen. With the right size hole relative to the right distance to a screen, a clear image is formed. That's the general principle of a pinhole camera.""
> 
> ""Applying this to an eclipse observation, the sun becomes the object to view. Point the pinhole camera at the sun and you see a solar image (projected on a screen) dim enough your eyes can enjoy.""
> 
> ""But the pinhole effect doesn't need a designed aperture. The solar image can be formed by any aperture if the shadow is the right distance away. The sunrays though tree leaves work to make a solar image on the ground below. Blinds on the window will covert a square opening into a round sun on the wall.""
> 
> ""The marvel is that diffraction doesn't need a round hole to form an image. A square pinhole will also work if its area is the same. Even for a random edged shape, the wave bending will average out to form an image of the scene contained in the incident light. That's why the spots of light through the trees are round; the gaps in the foliage are imaging the sun. ""I... Don't understand how the sun being partially blocked would change the shadows that a tree casts.Who's the dipshit building attack-speed Soraka?That's an amazing shot! The tree leaves act similar to how pinhole cameras work, [leaving these little eclipse casts](http://i.imgur.com/Y20dSSJ.png)Go see for yourself during the [next eclipse](http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html) near you.For those doubting, it [works like this.](http://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x400/pinholeprojectionpaper.jpg)This guy. Think about all of the cameras pointed up at the moon when this was taken, and this smart guy is facing the opposite way.The last time a total eclipse happened in my area, I was 7 or 8. We were in school and we all went out with our two pieces of paper to see the pinhole effect. I was a hyper kid and my teacher hated me so as soon I started to get the least bit out of hand she sent me to sit on the curb in the shade and miss the eclipse. I was super bummed seeing as how I really liked science stuff. As I sat there I started to notice all the shadows changing around me. It was like millions of little pinhole eclipses all around me. All of the rest of the class was out in the parking lot with their shitty paper pinholes but I had my own personal light show. It was cool as shit. Thanks for bringing back that memory OP. It happensh here in Shcotland, too. My ash looksh like a shilver-birch! 
http://imgur.com/ZSbxkuLI know what's happening here! My physics teacher showed us an extremely similar photo. It's called a pinhole camera. The leaves in the tree have tiny little holes in them that the sunshine is passing through. This causes the image to be projected upside down on to the house like that. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera

Fun fact! If you wear glasses get a piece of paper and poke a tiny hole in it. Look through it without your glasses with one eye and you should be able to see clearly through the hole.Pretty sure if you had a staff with a gem on it you could stick it in the ground and use mirrors to uncover ancient secretsi saw this once in...1993 I think?

Luckily I was going to the engineering building and they has all kinds of stuff to look at it.  the best was looking through a compact disc.toenail clippings...everywhere.Looks like Porom and Palom just cast FlareAlso, during near-totality, overhead power and communication lines will throw sharp shadows.

Walk of shameThis reminds me of my old 'triever, Ben. Like most of 'em he loved water, even when he was reeeally old.

We went to house sit for some friends in Dorset (UK) when he was about 12 and cracking on a bit (actually lasted till 16 bless him). One day I took him and my much younger german shepherd Sadie for a walk, and we came across this sort of drainage ditch/ stream that was about as deep as I am tall and about the same distance across, so pretty deep and steep. Ben smells the water and, with a speed I didn't realise he was still capable of, decides to clamber down to it. He sank up to his belly in mud. I went in after him and tried to haul him out but the sides were too high - the best I could do was hold him in my arms against the side of the ditch so he didn't sink any deeper. We were good and stuck.

The antics of my frantic younger dog and my panicked shouts eventually attracted the attention of another dog walker, and I begged her to go back to where we were staying, about half a mile away, and get my mum. She headed off after tying Sadie to the bridge over the ditch for me.

I waited for what seemed like hours, probably about half an hour, up to my calves in pretty cold mud, covered in more mud and a copious amount of hair, holding an exhausted dog. I was wearing a sundress, so my arms and legs were covered in scratches as well. 

Suddenly, firemen! My mum had called them after hearing the description of the ditch. I have never been so happy to see firemen. In minutes they had placed Ben into a large tarp and hauled him out of there and pulled me out. Mum and Ben got a lift back in the fire engine but they couldn't fit me and Sadie, and I was pretty much a mud person by then. I didn't want to ruin my shoes so I ended up walking back barefoot with a frantic germen shepherd stepping all over my feet on a gravel road with no pavement.

By the time I got back my mum had made the firemen (must have been about 8 of them at least) cups of tea. She then got the hose out to start hosing Ben down and the bastard started running around the garden to get away from the water with all the energy of a dog half his age.

The firemen did offer to pressure hose me but I declined.

**TLDR - elderly dog tried to swim in a 6ft deep, steep sided ditch full of mud, I got stuck trying to get him out, got covered in mud, hot firemen rescued me looking like a cavewoman, dog regained enough energy to run away from the hosepipe afterwards.**How hard did you laugh?[deleted]I thought this was a honey badger from the thumbnailThat's the difference from a Lab and a Golden.

https://secure.npca.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1391Well, fuck. What's Cali complaining about? I can see shit loads of water.[This is from a trip I made a few months ago, here's a link to more if anyone's interested.](http://imgur.com/a/08QJN)In Oregon, the entire coastline is public. You cannot buy it. California has many robust laws governing development, particularly in coastal areas.  Laws like the California Coastal Act prohibit restricting public access to beaches and make all development on the coast subject to government review.  The California Environmental Quality Act gives *anyone* legal standing in court to litigate against a permitting agency (City, County, etc.) if the agency has not fully disclosed, evaluated, and mitigated for environmental impacts resulting from a development.  CEQA especially is used by environmental activist groups to prevent development in pristine habitats.  It's not a 100% effective method to prevent development, however.  Usually the goal is to delay the project so long that the developer runs out of money or the investment loses its profitability and they give up.

A great example of a beautiful place in California that was slated for luxury development is the [Gaviota Coast](http://www.sblandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Gaviota-Morning-Tajiguas.jpg) near Santa Barbara.  The development proposed on that land was litigated for decades before the developer went bankrupt.that's definitely big sur.I'm a land use planner who, with my colleagues, manages the Local Coastal Program for a northern California county. The majority of my day is spent getting yelled at by landowners who don't understand why they can't develop their land however they would like. Thanks for appreciating the reason I get yelled at all the time! Speaking of protected coast, I just took a canoe ride down the Russian River here in CA. There were tons of spots on the shore that said ""Private shore, no stopping here."" Is there no protection for river access? That seems crazy to me.For those of us who want to preserve wild space in the Bay Area, check out [Peninsula Open Space Trust](http://www.openspacetrust.org). They use donations to buy up land and create parks and other protected open space. 

They help keep my weekends looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gm9pKRp.jpg).

That's me in the pic! Check out www.operationthonapa.com for the whole story. Great fun and a crazy trip....never actually thought we would find what we were after Can you imagine spending so much time and energy on this, and then seeing it on the ground and picking it up. Probably a very surreal moment I've been following their [blogging](https://operationthonapa.com/) as they have found different items from the plane, human remains, etc. This is an amazing story to watch unfold and my hat's off to these awesome two dudes. Talk about having a goal and getting it done.

More info on the crash: 
[Eastern Airlines Flight 980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980)Dan Futrell and I (Isaac Stoner) got lost down a rabbit hole on on Wikipedia looking up unrecovered black boxes. Took some serious effort but now there's a smashed up flight recorder on my kitchen counter!  That's the orange box. They need to keep looking.Actually, they found pieces of the casing of the flight recorders, and some loose magnetic tape which, [as they themselves say on their blog](https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61), may be nothing more than tape from a passenger's home video.

It's far too early to say they've found anything substantive, regardless of how amazing it is that they've managed to find anything at all.I just got to the part of the blog where they talk about finding crocodile skins all over the debris field, and basically accusing Eastern Airlines of taking part in a crocodile skin smuggling ring. Interesting...maybe they'll end up uncovering more than they bargained for, which is like the beginning of every horror/thriller movie.Why didn't any of the various airplane crash investigative agencies do this?

edit: answered my own question, sort of:  The NTSB did send people but ""because the wreckage was spread over a vast area and covered by 6 to 9 meters of snow, it was not possible for him and his fellow team members to locate either of the ""black boxes.""""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980#On-site_investigationI set small goals like not losing a sock in the laundry and I can't even accomplish that.I had read their blog as they were doing this. The part where they were finding the human remains and burying them... super powerful stuff man. I teared up a little reading that. Congrats on finding the recorder!That's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Or a small box in the Andes...Holy shit this is awesome. It makes me want to find another plane crash that has missing black boxes and go find one myself... Talk about bucket list shit.I bet it was the last place they looked.This will be an over dramatized movie, I guarantee it. ""dood we fahkin found the blahk bawx bro""Notice the subtle middle finger in the picture.I feel like they could have found this faster by crashing another plane into the mountain and watching where everything fell.Send these dudes after 370. Was anyone else thinking of the flight that crashed into the Andes mountains in 1972 and everyone had to resort to cannibalism?

""After two years of observations, we discovered that a burned out area ecosystem responds in quite unorthodox ways.

Further research is needed to reach any definitive conclusion.""Is anybody else irritated that the bracket direction illustrated on the sign doesn't match up with the actual bracket position?That is so freaking awesome!  I love it!I wonder how the timelapse will end up now that this is posted on Reddit..I passed this sign on a hike of the top of at Mt Diablo last Friday. For anyone in the Bay Area it's a great time to go. The wildflowers are everywhere and there are some that have not been seen in 50+ years because the fire has allowed for the right conditions for them to show up again. Also the clear days we've been getting make for killer views where you can see the GG bridge and Lake Tahoe Mountains.I interviewed one of the people behind this idea. The phone holder is worth $1.50 and can be found at most hardware stores.

Pretty ingenious idea and a great way to keep across ecosystem regrowth after fires. Check out the interview [here](https://soundcloud.com/1233newcastle/monitoring-fire-regrowth-with-smartphones) if you want. I saw this today too, all over Twitter. So I thought, let's see how successful that hashtag has been in documenting the change in that landscape.

>It started while Kaszlikowski was shooting the upcoming documentary K2 Touching the Sky. He wanted a personal project to occupy his downtime during the weeks-long filming schedule, so he sent his DJI Phantom on a recon mission to scout shooting locations. The drone scoped out places around Concordia, the area below K2 where the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers converge. Kaszlikowski spotted a section of glacier that was melting away, creating a dramatic clone-like structure and a picturesque miniature river.

>“The place was special, making a very clean graphic frame,” he says. “It was disappearing, melting, changing its form every day. It was quite obvious nobody will photograph it again like me; nobody will see it the same way the next season.”

Here's a summary on the shot and the [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/david-kaszlikowski-k2-glacier/)Higher resolution mirror wallpaper [Link](https://i2.wp.com/www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/033.jpg) (2200 x 1352)Looks like where you'd find an Ice-Type Legendary.This clears up some issues of what why it looks like that: 

*The Polish photographer and a guide trekked to the spot at night to create a strange but vivid image that looks like it might be an alien planet. He used a 30-second exposure shot with a Canon 5D Mark III on a tripod. While the shutter was open, he “painted” the water and surrounding area with an LED, creating an eerie glow on the ice and sky. Although he was there during the summer, the temperature still drops to a frosty 5 degrees Fahrenheit up there at 16,000 feet, so his hands were plenty cold while working.*

*The final image plays tricks with size and scale, and the foreground doesn’t provide many clues. Although the bend in the river is 65 feet wide, the mountains in the background are some of the highest in the world. The region includes K2, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum I and II—all of them topping 26,000 feet.*Needs a Yeti.I'm going to need a gold Chocobo.Looks like the pool with the moon spirits in the northern water tribe in avatarThe boundaries between reality and sci-fi are now blurred more than everI'd love to check out what kind of rocks are in there. i thought it was a 3d model at firstAnd then [these motherfuckers](https://i.imgur.com/kogRcW0.jpg) trod everywhere through it.This was not* a ""drone"", it was an rc helicopter (or [radio controlled multirotor helicopter](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom) ).  I know it's another mags/clips thing, but if we all try, I think we can correct it!  
*Edit: As pointed out below, this model has a self-guided self-operation mode, so I guess it qualifies as a drone and an rc helicopter. _The more you know!_Bullshit. That's a bowl of rocky mint chocolate chip HagenDaas in front of a picture of stars and mountains. What is making drones so ubiquitous now that wasn't present 10 years ago?

Did we not know how to make quad rotored remote control helicopters back then?  Is it the small cameras?   I don't get it.This looks like a scene straight out of Avatar [deleted]This is the spot where Samus Aran marries Master Chief.Its incredible that there are still undiscovered places on this planet that no human has ever set their eyes upon.

But the Himalayas are certainly a different thing...Just visited them, they are just massive.Their glaciers, lakes that are 15000 foot high of clear crystal water.

>From Wednesday, August 19, through to Sunday, August 23, the ninth Sail Amsterdam event will be held in Amsterdam. The popular opening parade runs for 12 kilometers and will consist of 50 tall sailing ships. Many of the vessels will have sailed there directly from Bremerhaven in Germany where another tall ships event ended last Sunday.

>In total, more than 1,000 vessels are expected to participate in the sailing extravaganza in IJ bay. Organizers expect up to two million visitors to attend the free event. According to them, Sail Amsterdam is the largest public event in the Netherlands - and the largest event of its kind in the world.

**Photo Details:**

This photo is a 26.6 MP photo  merged from two 24 MP shots from a Sony a7 camera. I had a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.4 manual focus lens (with a B+W filter for protection) attached. The two shots were merged using Lightroom's built in photomerge (which results in a single raw pano). Not much was done in Lightroom other than exposure changes, color changes and some healing brush to remove lens flare.

This photo was taken after I shot a 3 hour timelapse of the sunrise. I was just about leave, when I decided to actually take a few photos.

Your modesty is even more mind blowing.Was there in August, didn't see a single ballon in 3 days. Off-season, I guess :)I would comment, but my mind is blown.I'm Burmese, live near there (Bagan, Mandalay Region). :)Fun fact: there used to be farms with people living in them in the fields near those temples, but everyone was forcefully relocated by the military to turn the area into a tourist region! YaayyyyyyDo you have a higher quality version?  I wanted to use it as a wallpaper, but it looks like Imgur compressed the shit out of it.  You can use a straight up file hosting service like Dropbox or Google Drive to host the image instead of an image hosting service like Imgur.At first I thought those were buffalo or a similar type of animal. Then I saw the buildings and thought they were teeny tiny buildings. 

Those are not buffalo, those are trees. I need to go to bed.*ELAINE! I'M IN BURMA!*bagan is awesome.thanks for the new wallpaperThat's... absolutely breathtaking.

I've only built one brick/stone wall, but when we did it we started at the bottom.> Just as individual blocks were prepared, so too were the adjoining stones already set in the wall.  In order to receive a new block, bedding planes were carved into those stones below or to the side of the block to be added. This is how the Twelve-Angled Stone took on its busy upper outline; the upper portions of the block were recarved several times over as five blocks — set in a left to right sequence — were fitted along the course above.

> Other blocks in the wall were similarly shaped, then reshaped as new blocks were added to the masonry mass. As stones of irregular size and degree of finish were inserted into the mural fabric with fastidious technical consistency, the wall went up as tectonic sculpture.

- Adam Herring, “Shimmering Foundation: The Twelve-Angled Stone of Inca Cusco,” Critical Inquiry, Autumn 2010.

**Edit:**  Several comments questioned my use of ""nearly a thousand years."" Here's where I got that figure: according to wikipedia, Cusco was founded in 1100, and then occupied by the Inca ""from the 13th Century to the 16th Century."" I have no idea when that particular stone was laid, but it seems to have been somewhere between 500 and 900 years ago.  I was intentionally vague with the date, since I don't know the exact century. I've also seen suggestions that it predates the Inca. If someone has that info, I'd appreciate you commenting with it!

**Edit 2:**  Just out of curiosity, I went through and counted: as of right now, there are 54 top-level comments jokingly asserting that this was aliens.  There are 17 top-level comments that are literally just the word ""aliens.""  In the time it took me to count, 4 more were added.

[deleted]not gonna lie, but i'm kinda turned on by this...you should have seen their score at tetris....Why couldn't they have just made them all brick shaped and saved time and whatever they used for money back then. These guys were obviously getting paid by the hour.Ancient Aztec masons were agents of the Mexican Nuevo World Order as directed by the Illuminachos. I'm not saying it's aliens...But totally aliens.If there's one thing I've realised, it's that humans a thousand (or more) years ago were just as intelligent as we are today. Sure they didn't have anything like the technology we have, but they were just as skilled and had equally rich and complex lives as those we have today.Meanwhile, [last week...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O38QHzM0tzw/S-YAkoeP58I/AAAAAAAAB20/7FQ5sd8tv7k/s1600/IMG_1133.JPG)[there's no end to what you can do when you don't give a fuck about particular people](http://i.imgur.com/7R6PWWN.jpg)Quick Background before comment:  I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Architecture.  My thesis specifically focused on the integration of 3D printing technologies into masonry construction, using ancient approaches as a basis for design.

Now.  Something to know about these masonry walls is that they are not nearly as intricate and ""perfect"" as they appear to be.  From the outside (the face), the stones are chiseled using the surrounding stone as a basis.  On the interior of the wall, however, you will find that each of these stones is more ""wedge"" shaped, and is held in place with a plethora of smaller ""filler rocks.""  

From the outside, it looks impossible.  Once you look inside, you'll find that it's really just as simple as shaping one side of the rock, just along the edges.Peru was an amazing country to visit, I thoroughly enjoyed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. Some of the most amazing scenery. Anyone who has thought about going to Peru, fucking do it, spend at least a month there there's so much to see!

On a side note, I can't stand the ancient aliens bull shit. I don't think we give nearly enough credit to ancient peoples and their intelligence and ingenuity.

90% of dogs would be okay with a pet in that situation. 10% would not. Don't risk it. Sadly this is probably for insurance purposes. Most companies ask what type of dog you have and if it belongs to one of the groups they feel are an issue they will ask if your yard is fenced and if you have a sign. This keeps your premiums from going up much higher than if you didn't have a sign or fence. Some municipalities also require it as well. I have several GSD's and my insurance agent about died when I exclaimed I didn't intend to fence my entire property. I told him they're all trained and won't hurt anyone unless commanded to.

It was a miniature dachshund, I think her breed were known for being particularly nasty but this dog was the sweetest thing. 

She loved everything and everyone except one thing: The doorbell, her dreaded enemy. 

The doorbell going off was one of the few times we heard her bark. This dog was about 6-7 pounds at most but when she barked she sounded like she was the size of a husky.

It was the funniest thing, watching canvassers ring the bell and get this look of complete horror when the heard the barking. The look on their faces when they saw it was coming from a mini-dachshund was priceless.Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!I had a Siberian Husky that looked like a wolf. He was built like a machine, and looked ferocious, which was nice because I lived in a place kind of sketchy at night.

Twice my house was broken into with my giant direwolf downstairs & both times my dog barked & scared off the intruders.   
Instead of going to attack them, he was just saying ""Look at me"" then prancing towards him like a bubbly giant puppy hoping for head scratches.

People would cross the street to not have to walk near him, and he would bark trying to say ""Hey, I'm friendly please pat me on the head"" but everyone was scared of the love bug. Now I have a Shiba Inu & she's more of a guard dog than my Husky ever was.Seems as if he's trying to look at his own tongue and has gone cross-eyed.

I recognize Starry Night and The Scream, but what are the other paintings?As a salary-paid working artist I can't deny how exciting this is. Peoples first thoughts are obviously 'lol welp artists aren't needed', and to some very small corner of our industry, that may be true. But for me, I'm always looking for a new tool to speed up my workflow and this has incredible potential. A lot of times it's easier to stitch together photographs in interesting ways (called photobashing) instead of making a painting from scratch. I could see great situations where you spend time making one painting that has all the unique styling and flavor (a style frame or 'alpha' image ). Then spending the rest of your time making quick photo stitched illustrations not worrying about the final look, but focusing on the idea. When you've captured whatever ideas in your series of images, how cool would it be to input your 'alpha' image and let the neural network do its thing to the other photo-based illustrations. These are really exciting times!HA HA and the artist thought their jobs were protected from the machines.

Edit: I know artist are important it was a joke guys.The town depicted is Tübingen, Germany. Just saying, because its a small and irrelevant Town, people go to to study, but not much more :D damn people are smart here.. Nice pics too :DFrom a programming point of view this make me moist.ITT: ""it's Tübingen""Tübingen! I lived there for a yearHaha I lived in ""A"" for a couple of years! It's Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg for those who are interested.It doesn't seem like it recreates the photo with the style, it just seems like it attempts to recreate the photo AS the painting. You can see this most clearly in D, where the further half of the houses don't exist because in the painting there's just sky. Hell half of a house is still in the painting; it just seems to end half way through. It's still interesting, but I think you'd need some kind of AI to actually paint a photo in the painter's style like this tried to do.  This is probably going to get buried, but this article is very relevant:

Sonny: Fuck yeah, bitch. Who needs artists when we have algorithms!

Yay for our future distopia! Awesome!What does neural mean when it comes to this?This is a taste of the (relatively) new field of ""non-photorealistic imaging"" from computer science.  Computers can make things photo-realistic (see this [Morgan Freeman video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEdRLlqdgA4)), but it's very difficult to make images appear as paintings. 

There have been great advances in this technology.  Does anyone remember the Keanu Reeves ""cartoon"" movie, [A Scanner Darkly] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY5PpGQ2OWY)?  Here is a 2006 [paper] (http://kucg.korea.ac.kr/seminar/2008/src/PA-07-12.pdf) that describes how they do this in real time.  It's not that difficult for a computer; the basic steps are:

- Get the ""Difference of Gaussian"" line edges (find edges in the picture)
- Make a line drawing of the image from the above step
- Fill in the colors by doing a ""Luminance Quantiziation""; the simple explanation is the computer divides the colors up into, say, 100 different shades.  Then, for each pixel, decide which shade to ""round"" to.  This gives a ""cartoony"" feel to the image
- Done!

Again, this is something that can be done in REAL TIME; it doesn't take a lot of processing to execute (Source: I did something very similar for my graduate work).

The images posted above are more complex.  For paintings, it gets a lot more complicated simply because of the vastly different styles.  Each painter had his/her own unique painting style such that one image can be interpreted so many different ways.  It's impossible to list all the different work in this field, but here are some papers which describe how we got the images posted:

- [Mean Curvature Flow] (http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0729052)
- [Flow-based bilateral filter] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.5240&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- [Non-linear diffusion] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56205&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D56205)

There really are a TON more papers and the ones listed are relevant to the images posted.  Suffice to say, this is an emerging field, and while not ""perfect"", we are getting closer to non-photorealistic images.

If there's more interest, I'm happy to provide additional examples or (attempt) to explain the theory behind them!  This is an exciting time to work in digital images!

""I been here the whole time""I have so many questions.

How did you get a washer and dryer on the roof?

How did you have the time to get all that stuff up there?

Given the sun light, the shadow the home casts, that tree, and the light on your hand it looks that way.

It doesn't matter, just curious, want to make sure I am not losing my sense of spatial awareness.

What about the inside. Plus bonus pics of his toolshedhere are some of the differences i can see:

* entire house addition on the right side. 
* front door relocated. 
* eavestrough added all around. 
* chimney appears to be moved further back, but that might just be perspective. 
* addional window added downstairs. 
* lighting added near the corners of the house. 
* siding is horizontal now instead of vertical. 

i wouldn't be surprised if your dad tripled the value of the house, if not more. when was the picture taken? Almost doesn't even look like the same house, your dad does great work!Is the house in the back a guest host or someone else's? [removed]Your house grew a new wing!Coming from a house built by my father, after 15 years of living here, we finally got the last room of the house finished a few weeks ago.... Kinda...
Anyway, your dad did a great job on your house, looks great!That looks extremely norwegian. Great on him for fixing up the house .At first I was like, *why didn't you take this from the same angle*, but then I realized the entire part on the right is essentially new. That's some serious renovation work. Very sharp lookingI love how the additions actually fit the architectural style of the house. So many shitty additions look like shitty additions.My uncle was only a carpenter as a hobby but his and my aunt's house is the same way.  It started out as a 1 bedroom house about as big a as a double wide trailer.  They've added 2 bedrooms, a den with a second story master bedroom above it, and a 2 car garage.  He's probably tripled the square footage.  Not to mention the couple of big storage sheds and deck he's also built in the back yard.That's a great looking house.I honestly really like the second window he added on the face of the house facing the camera You've got to be more than a carpenter to pull that off! Did he hire expertise for concrete, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or anything?In all seriousness it would be amazing to have those kind of skills. I'm in the process of having a home built by a builder and constantly think man it must be amazing to be able to build your own home or do your own major repairs because you already have all of the tools and the skills to do it. Plus he probably know all kinds of people in the trade that can take care of other trades like electrical or plumbing.Wow. Jeg så deg poste dette på Face. Interessant.Sons of construction workers can relate.

We both spent a summer trapping these bears together, check us out at @grizkid and @jefe_larson on Instagram 

Side note, the drugged bear walked all of the way out of the den and we had to physically stop it until it fell asleep so that it would get hurt or lost while on the drug""Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour, Ursa Major?""That poor bear is scared as hell.  It can't run away and is backed up into the far end of the den.  It has to be the equivalent of an alien abduction for the thing. 

There I was asleep in my bed, when suddenly there was a bright light on my bedroom, and this little pink creature stabbed me with this weird claw on a stick.  I tried to run away but he had me cornered. As he closed the distance between us I tried to fight him off, but I must have blacked out afterwards, and then I woke up with another device implanted in my neck. I went to the bear doctor to have the last one removed, but they were only able to partially remove it. I'm really scared, and I don't feel like I'm in control of my life. 

Edit: typos. Well, at least that guys gonna go on to win an oscarITT: only jokes.

They come from my great-uncle, who did serve in the 201st squadron. I am just a distant nephew, and my uncle's family treasures all these memories, not just as memento, but also because they, and my family (my father served with them in a special forces group) still serve to this day with a lot of pride and honor, and with this legacy in mind.


You'd be healthily skeptic to doubt me in light of all the drug trafficking, corruption and violence levels in the country, even within the military; but boy, would I be fucking damned if I let anyone slip every Mexican soldier under that umbrella.



The stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.


The reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:


Mexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.

You can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.



But just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.


It could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.


Sure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.



Let's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.

I just got patriotic for a country I am not from. I guess propoganda works.Great post OP. On a similar note, Alot of mexican americans fought in WWII but at the time there was only ""white or black"" on the census. Natrually mexicans where considered white (and many still do idenfity as such).

 This is part of why i enjoyed fury because it really made effort to be accurate in what was out there./r/propagandaposters has tons of stuff like this.'Muric...I mean...'Mexica?!Notice the two mountains in the background? Those are actually volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. They are very important to Aztec mythology. Legend has it Iztaccihuatl was an Aztec princess who fell in love with Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl was sent off to war, she was falsely told by her father that her beloved had died in battle, so in turn she died of grief. When the warrior returned to find his lover dead, he laid her to rest and kneeled beside her body to mourn her death.Here's a good write up on the 201st squadron. [Strike of the Aztec Eagles] (http://www.airartnw.com/aztec_eagles_story.htm) I picked a up a print a while back with the signatures of the few remaining pilots. If I were a Nazi - I'd be wondering where the rattlesnake went.  As I learned from WWE, don't turn your back on a rattlesnake.Aaaaand.... I have a new wallpaper vMexico declared war on the Axis Powers in support of the Allies on May 22, 1942, following losses of oil ships in the Gulf, most notably the Potrero del Llano and the Faja de Oro, to German submarine attacks. Although most American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and Brazil were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.

Perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the Mexican military was the Escuadrón 201, also known as the Aztec Eagles. This group consisted of more than 300 volunteers, who trained in the United States to fight against Japan. It was the first Mexican military unit trained for overseas combat.

I used to work at a coal fired power plant. The plant had tall stacks that peregrines would nest at every year, which was cool because they were endangered at the time. One day, I'm working on the roof on an AC unit and my coworker and I spot 2 peregrines flying past us. We stop and watch them for a second and we notice that 1 of them has something in his talons (a mouse or something we assumed). Then out of nowhere, right in front of us, the one with the mouse flies upside down, the other one grabs the mouse out of his talons, and then he flips back and they continue on into the distance. Makes me wonder how many people have ever seen something like that.

EDIT: Cool I didn't expect to get so much visibility on this!
Bonus Story: I took a break on the 10th floor and the falcons were nesting above where I was standing. They started gawking and divebombing at me because I guess their nest was nearby.Write a book about it called My Side of the SkyscraperFalcony?Humans can barely afford a walk-up with a shared bathroom in Chicago. How the Hell does a single income falcon afford a one bedroom with a nursery and a view?I like the how Hawks faces is like

They lost all their clutches of eggs two summers ago :(

The apt owner is a cool guy on top of having bad-ass falcons on his porch too. Does a lot of sketch shows and has hosted a few trivia nights at a nearby bar.

Hopefully they'll be back next year"" sooo, is this going to be an issue or something?"" ""excuse me sir these are my fluffs and I'm going to have to ask you to take a few steps back""We have a peregrine falcon family that lives right above us in an apartment in Brooklyn. What I've learned over the past few years:

* The male (I assume) is as bad as a rooster in the mornings and will not shut up.
* They shit constantly. There are times in the summer when we pray for a good rain to clean off our terrace and there are often lovely white streaks down the sides of our windows.
* They are merciless murderers of pigeons.
* They do not like to eat the heads of pigeons. They are happy leaving those as little presents for us to try and keep our dog from eating.
* They will chirp kind of cutely outside a window from time to time.
* People like hearing about the falcon family that lives above you right up until they see a decapitated pigeon right in front of them that we hadn't noticed and cleaned up.
It's not the photographer's balcony, btw. The guy living there let the photographer and the photographer's girlfriend stay with him for a little bit to get the photos though.That is the fastest bird................... in the world.*LET'S GO HAWKS!*>The account caught the eye of Luke Massey as he lounged one night in his camper van near Venray, the Netherlands, scrolling through Instagram after a full day filming beavers.

We've decided that you aren't Orcs.Entomologist here! I've studied Ladybugs (or what we entomologists like to refer to as Coccinellidae Cucujoidea or C. Cucujoidea or Ladybugs or just LBs).

What they are doing is forming what we call a ""rub nest"". A rub nest is when 2 or more LBs come together and ""lick"" each others faces (fun fact LBs have tongues almost 1/3 the length of their bodies!) and mouths to share nutrients and more importantly, build each other's immune systems by sharing antibodies with one another. They will stay like this for hours at a time, licking each others faces until their immunity are bolstered and they can no longer become sick and die.

But maybe there's some comfort in knowing he helped so many others, which would be a feat for anyone, let alone an 11-year-old. He was still a child, and it would have been absolutely understandable if he'd thought of himself first. Very powerful picture.Signing up to be an organ donor is basically the easiest thing you can do to help save lives -- everyone should be an organ donor. This little boy is an example to us all.holy shit, death being the catalyst of life. no better way to end one's journey than by allowing others to continue theirs. My sister passed away recently.  She was an organ donor, and everyone involved in that process was incredibly respectful, compassionate, and above all grateful for her decision.  She saved the lives of several people directly, provided organs for research, and tissues which could wind up helping 100s of people.  As bad as it all was, it's some small comfort knowing that her death wound up helping others.[More information about this great human being in case anyone is interested.] (http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/11-year-old-chinese-boy-donates-organs-to-save-others.html)I always thought you couldn't donate if you had cancer?Relevant XKCD :

http://xkcd.com/659/To see these people bowing to a boy donating his organs, is such a powerful image. I got chills all over my body. the respect they have is so immense.Much respect to this young guy.I find it amazing how something as simple as a few people arching their backs in your direction can mean more than a thousand words of thanks.  
It's like a primitive way of showing appreciation from before we were able to communicate with words.  
It's also great seeing such a positive piece about China. Seems to be in an almost permanent state of negativity these days.  
Respect.I'm not sure if this is relevant, but here goes: 

My close friend took his life three months after he turned 22. Everyone was devastated and so caught off guard. He was so loved. Anyway, during his funeral I was so upset that I didn't think there was anything that could be said that could take away my grief. Well, I was wrong. He was an organ donor. They were able to use pretty much every single organ from the neck down and his eyes. The pastor of the funeral told us that because of his death, his eyes allowed a child to see for the first time. Whoever that kid was is so lucky, his eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue. Miss you, buddy.

 There's nothing that can take the pain away, but I hope for this child's family, the knowledge that he has given others a new chance will help. This will probably get buried but when I was in high school I had a friend who suffered brain damage after being hit by a car while he was crossing the street. He lived for the following three days before his death. He, too, was an organ donor, and the day after his death a story was reported of an anonymous 18 year old boy who had donated his liver to save a young girl. We all knew it was his. Following his death he donated any organ possible, from his heart to his kidneys to his corneas. He was a healthy young man whose death made an immediate and powerful impact on other people's lives. It's a sad but bittersweet story that I'll never forget. Most of the school followed through and became organ donors soon thereafter. RIP Robb. fuck...its too early to feelHere's the whole story in Chinese with more photos, if you guys are interested in, I will try to give a brief translation

Edit: Very rough one, please forgive any typos and grammar mistakes

The boy’s name is **Yaoyi Liang**. He came to Shenzhen (close to Guangzhou) 2 years ago with his older brother and sister, who are seeking jobs in this metropolitan.

04/12/2014, his sister noticed Yaoyi was having slight movement disorder, and even fell out one time. Yaoyi was sent to hospital immediately next morning, the examination told that it was brain cancer. The family originally thought modern medical technology could save the little boy, however, after 2 surgeries on 04/16 and 05/08 respectively, things didn't get any better.

Yaoyi had been dreaming to become an astronautic scientist/engineer before he was diagnosed the illness. However he changed his mind, he hoped that if he could recover, he would try his best to be a doctor to help relieving the pain of others. During the period, he showed incredible maturity, never really complains the pain but tried to comfort his mother. 

When it came into June, Yaoyi himself seemed to realize it was coming to the end. He said to his mom:” if I can’t survive, please donate my body.” The family came from rural area in China, his mom who was under-educated, can’t really get what her boy was talking about. And then she realized. At the beginning, his sister was strongly against the idea, as per Chinese tradition, it is peaceful only when whole body is buried. After some time, the family understood, that was also another form of living in this world.

06/06, 11:45 AM, Guangzhou Zhongshan 1st Hospital, relatives of Yaoyi were called; 4:35 pm, Yaoyi peacefully passed away. 5:19pm, Yaoyi’s kidney and liver were collected, and would have transplant to others within 8 hours to save their lives. Yaoyi has become the 142th multi-organ donator in Shenzhen.
I wasn't aware that cancer patients could donate their organs. Are there not concerns about unknown metastasis, circulating tumour cells or circulating free DNA?

Edit: I read further into the thread and this is discussed, never mind! What was his name? This picture is amazing and this child deserves the dignity of his name being known Way to go kid. I'm very proud of youEvery day I come to Reddit for laughs and leave with tears. Reddit is the first ten minutes of Up in constant loop. My grandma received a heart from a young man who died when dove off a pier.  This was in the 90s and they told her she only had about 5 years to live with it and everyone else who did the program.  Thankfully she was given another 18 years.  This was enough to see me be born and grow up. Although she unfortunately passed away a year before I graduated high school, I am so glad I got to know her.  Without someone donating their organs that would have never happened.  Every year my grandma would have a second birthday on the young man that gave her the heart's birthday.  She would go to his grave and release a heart shaped balloon.  Powerful. I wish it was higher resolution so I could frame it and hang it up at my uni accommodation. Pictures like this push me through med school.An 11 year old makes the decision to save as many lives as he can, in the face of impending death. I can't get most full grown adults I know to make a reasonable decision if their life depended on it. This young... child, hero, saint... whatever you call him, had little knowledge and experience of many of the truly wonderful joys and experiences of life, yet was wise enough, and kind enough to ensure others to get a chance he never will. Its much too bad that with type of selflessness and concern for fellow man this child held, that he didn't get many more years to make the world a better place. We need more people like him.I haven't felt this sensation of moisture coming out of my eyes in a while. It's not sadness, it's more a deep sense of respect and admiration.

It's the only reason that I choose that liquor store over others in my town.I'm not handy at all but this situation would have me in this hardware store buying stuff useless to me every time I was ""in the neighborhood.""I once went to a gas station in the middle of bumfuck nowhere that had a german shepherd.  No human, far as I could tell, just a german shepherd.

As soon as I walked in, that dog lept off the counter, growling, and ran over to bite me - I thought I was a goner, but it just stood there, holding my pant leg with his teeth.  Then it slowly pulled me towards the door, and I kinda said ""Okay"" and started walking to the door, dog leading me by the pant leg, when I got to the door, it started pushing me.  That's when the (human) owner came out from the bathroom in the back and said ""Oh I see you've met Sandy"".They would instantly become my exclusive hardware distributor. I wouldn't shop around for prices. Anything in my house breaks and I'd be on my way to the dog store. Labs are so kind and helpful and boisterous and they're just my favoriteThis is my favorite thing I've seen on the internet today.Ah , the store dog. Awesome ! Our neighborhood hardware store has a shop cat. All that lazy bastard does is lie on the counter in the sun. And occasionally try to trip customers while escaping out the door.

Still - the neighborhood hardware store is a wonderful place. Little old man or lady who knows where every thing is, even the gizmo they bought in 1947 and never sold. If you have one , cherish it, shop there. Because big box home stores have no souls and often no clue !I hope OP wanted a sprinkler hose, cuz they got one now.Good job pupper. 

Whoops, wrong sub. http://i.imgur.com/xxR7c6P.jpgThere's a gas station in a town I used to live in ran by some hilarious incredibly nice middle eastern dude. He trained his cat to reach out its paw and lower its head to show you respect for a tip, then when you give it a tip it puts it in its mouth (if it's cash) and brings it to him. Or pushes it off the counter into a little red cup if you use change. After that he gives it a treat. 

In Belgium, Wisconsin, the only hardware store in town is also the only liquor store in town.He looks like such a good boy :) I want to give him a treat.Now you can't shop anywhere else ever again. 
*Edit: Can I be someone other than GallowBoob?Do they sell anvils?I grew up in a small town. As a kid I needed a last minute physical so I could play sports in school. Our local doctor wasn't available so we went to an even smaller town nearby where I could see a doctor. The doctor's office had a giant lazy dog lying on the floor of the waiting room. He was breathing so you could tell he was alive but otherwise he gave no indication of life. The doctor was smoking a cigarette with the longest ash imaginable. He asked me, ""Are you healthy?"" I nodded. He said,""ok"" filled out the form and I left. That was the physical.I hope this is true, because that's fuckin' adorable.They used to have seven dogs and a wonderful selection of dark chocolate.Ask him a question please... I have to do some work on my ROOF!... Does he think I should ROOF! with shingles or go with roll ROOFing on my ROOF!??My name is?
Reminds me of a black lab I saw walking with its owner down the high street here in Canterbury. There was an empty plastic bottle on the sidewalk just in front of them. The dog looked up at their owner who then slightly gestured towards the bottle.  Without missing a step, the lab scooped up the bottle and kept on trotting along.  I like to think it carried that bottle all the way home and then dropped it in the recycling bin!

Is it just me or is that one massive dick?Well one thing that is interesting is that Harrison Ford is an able handyman and carpenter. Early on after he moved to Los angeles to do Radio voice overs he became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two small sons. While working as a carpenter, he became a stagehand for the The Doors. He also built a sun deck for actress Sally Kellerman and a recording studio for Brazilian band leader Sérgio Mendes.

What landed him his big break is funny. In 1972 He was hired to build cabinets at George Lucas's home. who subsequently cast him in a pivotal supporting role in the 1973 film, 'American Graffiti'. Lucas and Ford became good friends after that. In 1975, Lucas hired him to read lines for the actors auditioning for the film Star Wars. It wasn't until he had done line readings for a couple months that George Lucas, with the studio's ok, gave him the role of Han Solo.

Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the behest of local authorities. During his assigned duty time assisting the Teton County Search and Rescue he has aided in two mountain rescues. On one of the rescues Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. The hiker boarded Ford's helicopter and proceded to vomited on him unaware of who the pilot was until much later; The hiker is quoted as saying, ""I can't believe I barfed on Harrison Ford!""

I guess she will have to be her own best friend now.Every time I see Harrison Ford, I get the feeling that we are all bothering him. 

I think it makes me like him more.He chose... WISELY.I can't believe that man is 70.  That's just ridiculous.  I would bang that like a screen door in a hurricane.I think I gayed a little...Argh can't believe he is 70.. So many legends over 70 we better appreciate while they are with us : Freeman , Hackman , Eastwood , Hoffman, Connery , Pacino , Nicholson and finally De Niro who turns 70 in August.

EDIT: Wow, Gold. Would have thought that this late comment would get burried. Thanks for popping my cherry. First gold.One of my friends studied in China with a bunch of people from North Korea. He said that they were amazed by the plethora of stuff you could buy in a grocery store. If you had been caught taking photos illegally, what kind of punishment would be typical?

I'd expect your camera would be confiscated or you'd be forced to delete the photos, but was there any threat of being detained or anything?Looking at your full photo series, these are some amazing candid photos of life in North Korea that I have never seen anywhere else.  The one thing that struck me was that any picture that wasn't in a city had food growing in it, and the hills were almost denuded of trees.In North Korea, there are places you can visit and places you cannot visit, and the latter are far more numerous. Well, this is one of them. Usually, we were accompanied by our guides, one in the front, one in the back. But at one point they were both in the front, which allowed for a literally 15-second long detour into this ordinary shop for North Koreans. That gave me maybe 10 seconds to take this picture, before being kicked out by the ""bad cop"" guide, and the atmosphere became rather unpleasant. I'm not sure if he saw me taking these pictures.

Also, I've got a photo album with the photos of my journey into North Korea, if anyone is interested.Nicely done!  Would love to see more of those ""staged"" North Korean areas to see the parity.My Chinese girlfriend has been to North Korea and had these pics to share.

This is an example of a stellar piece of original content that is both interesting and informative.  I also appreciate the fact that /u/M1ckey took time out to answer other people's questions about his trip.

Thanks for taking the time out to post this to Reddit.  With all that said, I have a couple questions for you.  :)

First, did you ever have any experiences where you felt somewhat anxious or unnerved (guards acting threatening, eyeing you up, etc.)

Second, were there any Americans with your group?  I'm curious if they would allow Americans at all (I know they did in the past, but obviously they can change that at any time).  

Thanks again.  Love your pictures.  This is actually worthy of a publication like National Geographic picking up on this or maybe a story in the NYT.  Very cool.Staggering, beautiful, eerie and quite sad. Do you want to be thrown in a gulag? Because this is how you get thrown in a gulag.

http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/

Their most famous member is John Dobson, who apparently just died. He invented/popularized the telescope design that the OP's photo shows - it's called a ""Dobsonian"" mount.

There's a documentary about him called A Sidewalk Astronomer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sidewalk_AstronomerSo did you take a look at jupiter?We need more people like this who want to share the amazing parts of the world, just for the satisfaction of opening eyes to new things.Holy shit I would jump all over that.

Where was this?On our honeymoon to Hawaii, my wife and I went to a roof top observatory at our hotel.  There were about 10 other couples for that viewing and not one of them ever stopped talking and half the people didn't look through the fucking telescope.  Here was this super enthusiastic guide with a very expensive telescope and a super dark sky, trying to talk and these fuckers were completely ignoring him while having their own conversations (loudly).  It was $25 a person and absolutely awesome.  To this day I have no idea what the fuck those assholes were up there for.  Really Cool, not at all sad. lots of people have never looked through a telescope, ever. It's really something!!Some people just want to watch the world learn!Except he is blind, and the telescope is pointed at the sun.A couple years ago while camping my kids (12 and 10 at the time) and I set up our good set of binoculars on the tripod to look at Jupiter. While wasn't much more than a bright dot you could also see four of the moons quite clearly.

As we were looking a girl in her early 20's walked by and asked what we were doing. My oldest (a budding astronomer) explained in detail about the planet, the moons, distances etc. Pretty soon we had a line of people wanting to look with my junior astronomer giving lessons. 

People are hungry for this kind of thing. All it takes is giving them an opportunity. 

And my kid learned when to just shut up and nod when some drunk guy started in about some conspiracy about satellites instead of trying to correct him.the old shoe-polish-on-the-lookie-hole gag... *classic*I took this iPhone photo of Saturn through a telescope like that.

He sets up like 3 or 4 scopes for anyone that wants to look. One of them is a big Meade LX series. I think it's the 8 inch. That's a big heavy thing to lug around and set up and he does it like 3 nights a week. He's a real cool dude.This man and his telescope alone could inspire a child to pursue science and astronomy and that would be beautiful. My former neighbor (an astrophysicist) used drop fliers all around the neighborhood inviting people to come join him for skywatching out in front of his house. He'd set up his telescope and enthusiastically talk about the things we were looking at. Unfortunately no one other than my family ever bothered to show up. They didn't know what they were missing!In the tradition of John Dobson.. some good old sidewalk astronomy! :)I think that's awesome that he is so excited about it that he wants to share it with everybody.  Far worse ways to spend your retirement, like feeding coins into a one-armed-bandit.I miss my grandpa. :( This same fellow showed me Saturn outside a dark bar in New York City 20 years ago.  It changed my life forever.A good buddy of mine got his PhD in Astrophysics . . . while he was in his program, he was very involved in outreach.  He sometimes set up telescopes on the streets of Harlem, and told me about a mother who cried when seeing the reaction of her kid as he looked through the telescope. That's damn cool, and perhaps THE most expensive telescope you will ever see in your entire life. That model of telescope costs thousands of dollars.

The only more powerful ""commercial"" scopes available are the types that are ""fold-out"" (look em up - basically what OP posted but with additional tubing/magnification). You will typically ONLY find these the fold-out type available to the public during public dark site meetings. 

Usually the only people who get to use such high powered equipment are those who own them, those who are in the field, and students at universities that attend classes which go to dark sites (AND, those who attend PUBLIC dark-site meetings, which very few know about).

I had the great joy in my life of taking an astronomy class (a great interest of mine, but no where near my degree) in which, for a grade, we had to attend a dark site twice. It was AMAZING. I actually got to see Saturn AND it's rings through one of these ultra powerful type telescopes. I was even able to snap of a picture through the eye port with an old film camera of the rings and when developed you could still make out the rings. 

I strongly recommend you look up local 'dark sites', which is where you will find FREE use of sweet shit like this.

I just hope this comment gets a few views, instead of all the bullshit comments that are at the top.I would of spent as much time as he was willing to give, talking to him. A lot of people see older folks as a nuisance but I love learning and interesting talk so I often talk to older folks. Especially ones with awesome telescopes who probably share the same great interest in space like I do.The man who invented that type of telescope mount, John Dobson, used to do that exact thing.  He'd setup a telescope in public for anyone to look through.  He died this year.I set mine up at the local park during the last eclipse and during the transit of Venus. :)I was reading a post yesterday about awful it is when older people act more arrogant, greedy, and just generally more unpleasant as they age. The consensus was that a lot of these elderly folks simply reach a point where they say ""fuck it,"" and just don't give a shit anymore, which often leads down a negative route of insensitivity and apathy.

This fuckin' boss of an old man, however, has taken the ""fuck it"" attitude and harnessed something truly amazing. He's decided, ""fuck it, am going to take my telescope-in-a-red-suitcase-with-wheels, set up shop in a parking lot, and *give* something to people. A different planet every day. No, every hour. Fuck it, doesn't matter, because I'm the fuckin' guy in charge, and I'm the one who decides which planet my fuckin' interchangeable sign will display.""

It's a closer look at the universe, a glimpse into the past, and a bit of magic all rolled into one. 

Bonus props to this gentleman for wearing a hoodie and shorts.

Your foot presses down upon a celestial canvas that has been a source of folklore, myth and religious speculation for millennia.

You wait a while and you see progress here and there. More discoveries are made about the nature of our universe. Machinery is sent to distant masses to search for signs of life. But there isn't any progress like what you imagined the first moment that your foot imprinted upon that fine lunar soil.

Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we say, love. 

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye, and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot has appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" 

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. 

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. 

Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear-Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. 

Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 

He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.

When I was in sixth grade I was suspended for getting into an argument with my religion teacher. She told us animals have no feelings and don't go to heaven. So, I told her about how my cats were so sweet and a somewhat famous news story of the time (2006) about a dog that saved its owner from something, I don't remember. Anyway, even after all that, her answer was,""Well, no."" I told her,""This is why so many people don't like religion, because of nuts like you!"" I was suspended for a day.

Those are sequences of sandstone, shale, and some limestone.  Shales are only deposited in deep oceans while sandstones are deposited near shore.  Limestones are deposited only in shallow marine waters.  You may ask, then why does the sequel switch or repeat? Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so ""floats"" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions.Almost 6,000 years of geological history right there!

It was a tough choice, tossing out a long accepted book's history for some painfully obvious hard data.

And an interesting bit form an interview he gave in December:

> ""You know what? I used to say, every day, 'I am so sick and tired of shaving.' I had to shave every day, every day, for 33 years,"" he explained. ""And even before that when I was working on local TV. And I just thought, the first thing I will do when I am not on TV is stop shaving. And everybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it,"" he explains. ""But it's interesting. I've kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I'm sort of enjoying. I can tell that people are off-put by it. And the more people implore me to shave, the stronger my resolve is to not shave.""

Source: http://www.eonline.com/news/750958/david-letterman-is-balding-bearded-and-looking-as-happy-as-ever-in-st-bartsCompletely unrecognizable is exactly the look I'd go for if I were him.He probably walks around wherever he wants, and people leave him alone. He's exercising, he doesn't have to shave, he's gone back to college and joined the girls' volleyball team...  

I see nothing wrong here.It's like someone took the Ring from him and now his body is catching up to his age. You know, like Blibo.Er, you got any gum?if he put his glasses on it would be totally obvious...grand maester pycelle?When you get home from work after 35 years and can be yourself againWait....this is total BS....Right? Letterman had hair?!Still reppin' Ball State, the only thing keeping Muncie, IN alive. 

Edit: Holy turds, I've got some reading to do. Figured a comment about Muncie on reddit would get buried af. Even though I haven't lived there since 1982, Muncie still holds a special place in my heart. I spent summers with my grandparents there growing up. Now I have to get nostalgic for a minute. Lots of fond memories of Pizza King (I'd kill for a Royal Feast right now), the Baskin Robbins and the movie theater it was attached to, cinnamon raisins biscuits from Hardee's, swimming and learning to play golf at the Delaware, trips to Upland to go to Ivanhoe's, Aladdin's Castle at the mall and beef manhattan's from the MCL, the urine stenched slide at Mitchell elementary, watching the cooks make the pizza at Noble Roman's, the children's museum, I'll^just^stahp^here^onions.

Edit #2: Just thought of a story about the first and last time my sister got to see the house my mom grew up in. My parents moved the family to Texas before my sister was born. My mother grew up poor and things were tough for her as a child. Growing up, she wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Muncie and leave it in her past forever. My mother, sister and I had to go back to Muncie for a funeral several years ago. While there, my sister wanted to see where my mom was raised and asked me to drive by, though my mother wanted no part of it. Let's just say the house was east of Broadway and south of McGalliard. I warned her that this would probably only happen once, if it was even still standing. I pulled up and parked out in the street, but told my sister we would not be getting out of the car. We sat for all of two minutes before I sped off, my mom in tears and my sister terrified. ""Neighbors"" started coming out of their homes to case us, yell at us and were rapidly approaching the car to do who knows what. It wasn't a fun trip.Since for some reason no one thought to post a picture of what he used to look like, apparantly assuming everyone in the world has seen his show, I give you this image.

[According to ABC, this picture was taken on his show May 4th, 2015](http://i.imgur.com/znBHbdj.jpg)

I hope that helps.He looks like the guy who used to give me cough medicine that made me sleepy. are.... are those old walkman headphones???http://i.imgur.com/4qrCN9r.gifvThis is understandable. He has looked a certain way for decades (shaven, hair in a certain way, suit) so of course he would want to switch it up now that he has the opportunity. Also he might want some privacy now that he is retired. He was awesome the last few months on air. There were no fucks given!He used to jog around my high school's track in Connecticut. Used to see him all the time. I'd never have guessed that was him.TIL in retirement one ages similar to that of a fruit fly. Santa??Even though you told me that's David Letterman, I'm having a hard time imagining that person as being David Letterman.The Ball State shirt gives it away. That's the first time I've seen him look happy in like 23 yearsJust last night I was watching some old clips of Dave on Youtube.  He was discussing with Jon Stewart how he dislikes shaving.  His excuse was something like, ""I don't like looking at my own face every morning"", and not shaving allowed him to avoid that.

Beautiful picture.  I love the depth of field present with the background.  You can tell that the lens quality was excellent back then.  You also did a terrific job with the colorization.Hah! Nice try. Using time travel is cheatingHow does colourising work? I'm confused as hell how you manage to get the colours.Colorization helps me pretend this wasn't 80 years ago and the kittens aren't dead... At first glance it looked like she was hanging kittens by their skin.  Best double take I've made today.Okay. Nobody asked, so I will. Any idea why she's putting them into socks and essentially hanging them out to dry?Middle cat- ""I'm so sick your shit Gretel""Holy shit. How long did this take. I enjoy recolorizing too. 

This is one of [Elvis](http://i.imgur.com/nAWijJo.jpg) I did. Middle kitten is so done with this shit.

I love that the film aesthetic is still intact. How did you manage to get her skin such a good color? I always have a hard time compensating for the gray hue underneath and it never turns out this good. Could you give any pointers?This looks like it could have been taken yesterday.

Caring profession, not giving a shit about stereotypes. Admirable.[deleted]Those are some smoking hot nurses. He did right I would say. Nurse who happens to be male here. In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options. Often you're immediately emasculated. Females look at you as a man doing a historically woman's job which makes them wonder why you're there to begin with. Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience. Now working as a traveller and agency RN, i sometimes work in multiple hospitals a week with all new faces and people to get to know which makes you all the more intriguing to the staffers if you don't suck. I am a female RN but my youngest brother is an LPN. He says his nursing school experience was just terrible and working with 99.9% women is less than ideal for him.I'm a male and I've been an RN for about 7 months now.  Out of taking care of hundreds of patients.. only one has had a problem with a male taking care of them.  All the others had nothing but positive things to say about males being in nursing.  When I starting nursing school I used to be afraid to tell people my major due to the negative stigma.  That stigma does not exist and I am now proud to tell people I am a nurse.

It feels like Pluto is taking a bunch of extreme selfies of itself all made up and doing unexpected things in an attempt to make its ex ND Tyson super jealousGreat post of picture...and not to wax too scientific in /r/pics, but this isn't really a ""sunset"", because Pluto basically rolls along its orbit with the axis tilted on its side (120° specifically) with regard to the plane of its orbit.  This means the ""north"" end of Pluto is constantly rotisserieing in sunlight, and the ""south"" end away from the Sun is in constant darkness.

So think of these as the mountains lining the way into Modor, constantly in twilight.Interesting to note the lack of crater activity. what are those layers in the atmosphere, and what's causing these mountain ranges to crop up? why does pluto have mountains but, say, the moon doesn't?for scale:

http://imgur.com/20TwnclThose mountain ranges look massive Question for any science-savy person: 

What are the causes of such enormous mountains? Plate techtonics? Impacts? I would love to know how tall those mountains are.Absolutely amazing. Less money spent on war and more spent on giving NASA it's budget back.  Now we need a new edit for one of my favorite wallpapers https://i.imgur.com/p5fLTnB.jpgMeh.  You should see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion.  Now that's something.The title of this picture in /r/space is simply “Close-up of sunset on Pluto”.

It really shows how sensationalist /r/pics has become.If that doesn't convince the Flat-Plutoists nothing will.Do we have any idea how tall those mountains are? How do they take such wonderful pictures with so little light? How big are these mountains? Ballpark it or something i just need an answer.Earth is prettier...I officially call Dibs on Pluto. Sorry everyone, I'm pretty sure I'm first to call dibs....soo...Why does it appear to have atmosphere?It is amazing,

Really fucking weird movie. Lonely dude pays random actors to pretend to be his family for his birthday. I recommend a watch, if you're fluent in Spanish.Hardly a new idea. Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did something similar on his famous painting 'Las Meninas', in the 17th Century.

The painting depicts the Royal Spanish infanta Margarita Teresa with her maids and other aids, taken from the point of view of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana who are at the same time posing for a portrait that Velázquez himself is depicted painting (left side).

The only clue we have about who is Velázquez painting in this scene is a mirror hanging at the back of the room, where the reflection of the king and queen can be seen.

This is in Milan, Italy 
  
> Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a pair of residential towers in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy, between Via Gaetano de Castillia and Via Federico Confalonieri near Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station. They have a height of 110 metres (360 ft) and 76 metres (249 ft) and will host more than 900 trees (approximately 550 and 350 trees in the first and second towers respectively) on 8,900 square metres (96,000 sq ft) of terraces. Within the complex is also an 11-story office building; its facade does not host plants.

> The towers were designed by Boeri Studio (Stefano Boeri,Gianandrea Barreca and Giovanni La Varra). It also involved input from horticulturalists and botanists.Any civil engineers here have some insight to how this works in the long term?

As far as I know, roots don't give a fuck about concrete and will just grow straight through it. I'm assuming they do something to prevent this, maybe metal instead etc. That's gotta be a bitch to maintain honestly. hanging gardens have been built in a far away land! Dude, vertical forest.

One thing to note about this photographer is that he actually dressed up to go to the wedding.

Having been to quite a few weddings now, a shocking amount of photographers turn up dressed like it's a hacky sack tournament on the college lawn. Dear all men (and/or women): take everything out of your suit pockets before the photo session. I am sorry I am not staring at you, I am taking your picture.My best friend is a wedding photographer/videographer, and it's honestly amazing the more I watch how much angles, lens, filter can change a shot. My sisters wedding was outdoors, and it happened to be overcast when it was supposed to be sunny and an unprecedented rain actually moved in later in the evening (damn TX weather), but you couldn't even tell in any of the shots. He made sure all pictures were taken from angles where the little bit of sun was in the background, made amazing use of the natural lighting, and always panned the video to pick up the most natural light etc. It looked so good and made my sister so happy. That guy has a great eye for photography. He's going places!For a split second I thought he was dead and I thought of Rick and Morty :(

https://www.flickr.com/photos/caseyrbrown[deleted][deleted]^^^^Some ^^^^assembly ^^^^requiredHave to wonder if there is a bunch of these sitting in the corner of some Army base warehouse because of long forgotten clerical error. I had a teacher back in high school who was in the Vietnam war.  His job was to blow up bridges so the VC couldn't follow them or use the bridges to resupply.   Well, this meant he pretty much spent most of his time hanging around ""bases"" which were no more than commandeered villages.  One day, he takes bricks that were just sitting around and made a gigantic barbecue pit.  A villager had given him a pig for some reason or another, so he decided to throw a gigantic party for everyone stationed in that village, as well as any villagers that wanted to come.  Not surprisingly, he got into huge trouble, and was removed from the village and stationed in the worst, most degrading job there was.  They made him guard a junk yard in the middle of the jungle.  It was mostly jeeps exactly like this one.

Well, as you can see from the picture, these Jeeps mostly just bolt together. So 12 hours a day with nothing to do, his boredom got the best of him, so he started bolting these pieces together from various junked Jeeps to see if he could make a functioning Jeep.   He said he got about 90% there. The only thing he couldn't do with the parts he had was functioning brakes.  So he did the best he could, he bolted a gigantic pole to the side of the jeep that he could shove into the tire and pull as hard as he could to slow the jeep down.

He ended up driving the jeep around that little area for his remaining time in Vietnam, sometimes even driving around officers and other dignitaries, no one even questioned whether he was supposed to have a Jeep or why he had to use a gigantic pole to stop.The ultimate example of ""its worth more in the box"". http://imgur.com/a/5ZgEX

Army vet here, I was stationed in South Korea back in the early 80's. I worked at the base HQ but was all enlisted were required to pull motor pool duty one week a month. I reported ""as ordered"" to the Motor pool non-com and was assigned the duty of tearing down and repacking two Korean War era jeeps. They looked very much like the picture. They crates had a jeep size fold-out cloth with actual sized spots for each individual parts with pictographs of where to find the part on a jeep and how to remove them. The entire process could be done without reading any words. It took me ten days to complete the job. It was a most satisfying task.
Fragiiiillllle.Does it include an allen wrench or what?Are these the ""jeep kits"" that where offered for sale for $450.00 in the back of old magazines? First thing I thought ""Some assembly required"" I kinda wish that I could get a modern car shipped to me like this.  It would be fun to have to put it together before you use it.  Like the adult version of Legos!

**Edit:** I completely forgot about kit cars!  So I guess this still is a thing.They did this with larger vehicles too, I have a M35A2 and they were designed to ship in crates as well.  The tops disassemble with simple tools, windshield folds town and the highest point on the vehicle is the top of the steering wheel.I believe they were a lot more effective after they replaced the square wooden wheels with round rubber onesJ.ust

Hitting all the red lights. So frustrating. He's jerking around corners, hitting the gas pedal like it personally screwed up his order, just generally driving with as much huff as an annoyed middle-aged, middle-class guy can.

At one light, a lowrider pulls up next to him, blasting the bass, bunch of rowdy young dudes out being noisy. They start yelling at my dad, kind of laughing at him, ""Hey man! Hey!""

My dad is in no mood to get into some street race with a bunch of yahoos or whatever they want. He ignores them and continues on, but they follow him, honking at him, meet at the next light, ""Yo man! Heyyy!""

Finally he's like ""WHAT?!"" 

""Hey man, you got a cat on your car, man!""

Poor kitty was clinging on for dear life and of course as soon as he pulled into the nearest parking lot, it shot off into the bushes to kiss solid ground. 

The lowrider followed my dad into the lot and all five young guys piled out and spent the next 10 minutes shaking bushes, crawling around, making kissy noises, and helped my dad catch the cat.

He continued running across campus and everyone who had been staking me out ran after him.  
&nbsp;  
I waited two minutes and then walked quietly back to my dorm.I was in a dorm where there was a girl who looked just like me, dressed like me, and even had the same major. 

She even walked and talked like me. It was rather unreal. Our names sounded similar, just one letter off, so people would call out to her and I'd respond, and vice versa.

My mother was visiting me once and I went to take a shower. At around the same time, my doppelganger got done with hers and began walking to her room. My mother saw what she thought was me going somewhere not my room and called out to me and she answered. I came out to see both of them talking and my first reaction was 'mom, that's not me!'

We've stayed in touch and she's now a researcher in the same area as I am. When I was quitting my earlier job, I referred her to that team and she got hired. My old colleagues say it's like I never left.

Edit: I saw her parents at graduation. They look nothing like mine, though the resemblance to her is clear. I'm also the spitting image of my mom except for my father's jawline, so I'm not adopted either. That made it genuinely cool for me.I read ""10 years ago I went off to college"" and thought, man, you must be old.

Then I realized that I started college 11 years ago. 

:lI am a neuroscientist. In biology/medicine, we use [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to find articles, and authors are listed as ""LastName, FirstInitial SecondInitial"". I'm listed as Thompson CK. And since Thompson is such a common name, I'm not the only Thompson CK. In fact, there is another Thompson CK publishing in neuroscience, and occasionally I get emails for him, because his name is Christopher K Thompson, my exact name. 

Every year, there is one big neuroscience conference with 35,000+ attendees, and last year I emailed him to see if we can meet up. He comes to my poster, and I am just shocked at how similar her looks to me! I have two brothers, and he looks a lot more like me than either of them! Even more, he also happened to grow up in a town about 8 miles from my hometown. We both have degrees from the University of Illinois. We both really like pizza and beer. I mean, what are the chances...

And I never forget faces. Eventually I was like ""No, I never met you!""

And the response was ""Yeah, we met earlier, you are Sean from Baltimore"". And I was from Baltimore.

Turns out, there was another Sean from Baltimore staying at the hostel and meeting loads of people. 

Yeah, and he looked *exactly* like me. When we ran into each other in the hallway I instantly knew this was the dude. He looked at me the exact same way since he had been dealing with the same issue since we were both very outgoing people.

We talked for about 3 seconds and then both ran in different directions. I guess we were both freaked the fuck out that we were both Sean from Baltimore, short hair, same facial structure, same clothing style, same height, same build, same social personality...

Hopefully all these new links hold after DropBox crapped out.Wiki on the Greater Tokyo area http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area 

More people live here than the countries of Canada and Iraq [Reminds me of this picture of Mexico City](http://i.imgur.com/FPO3S59.jpg)I visited Tokyo once, and one thing that stuck with me was how I've read a lot of science fiction that I thought was original, but no, it's just describing Tokyo.  Pretty much everything that's written about a giant city-like planet is really Tokyo inspired.

It definitely made me think about how there are surely some people who have never left that city in their lives, and just what you imagine the rest of the world to be like if you're one of those people.No wonder it's taken Godzilla so long to destroy it.It kind of looks like a sci-fi concept of a planet-wide city.For perspective, [this is the greater Tokyo area superimposed onto the United Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/Eqfme.jpg)See that EA? This is what Sim City should be about. Let me build (or at least plan and manage) THIS. 

What's so hard about it?  I just essentially need Sim City 3000 on today's hardware. No real 3D is even needed.I live in Tokyo... this is just one direction... If you go to to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building, Mori tower, or Tokyo Sky Tree on a clear day, you just see... cement as far as the eye can see. You'll see Kawasaki connect to Yokohama, and then it just fades into the distance. Then you'll see Chiba and Saitama (which we consider the sticks) wall-to-wall with buildings. Then you'll see all the way to Takao-san with nothing but buildings until you get right to the foot of the mountain. It's absolutely insane...

At night it is breathtaking, though.

http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-gigapixel-roppongi-hills-mori-tower/#0.00,0.00,90.0Definitely not as big as Tokyo, but [São Paulo](http://static.theglobalmail.org/cache/37/13/3713345cd59dc2ed9ec915e33f3e5c96.jpg) is also worthy of consideration.Neo-Tokyo is biggerTokyo is literally the population of Canada, in one city. It took me 8 days to drive across CanadaWorst city to survive a zombie apocalypse in.[Google Maps 3D view from roughly the same position](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Tokyo,+Japan/@35.6490331,139.533142,3087a,20y,79.5h,74.73t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x605d1b87f02e57e7:0x2e01618b22571b89?hl=en)

From this it's easy to find the big landmarks. 

Shinjuku is group of skyscrapers on the left side in the middle, which is said to have the busiest subway station in the world. At the right side of the big green park you find Shibuya, you know the shopping district with the [worlds busiest street crossing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2685/4458168800_2727610646_b.jpg),  and the cluster of ""dark"" skyscrapers, guess they are just being shadowed by a cloud, is just beyond the imperial palace and gardens. 



It is in fact the only city large enough for my mother.  When I was visiting Tokyo I thought I would go out to the bar one night. I never thought about the fact that the trains might stop running at some point. So when I came out of the club at 2-3am, I realized I had to walk back to my hotel. Five hours later, after walking in a straight line, I got there. ### it's a **MEGALOPOLIS!** I think I made something like this in SimCity once. The city barely lasted a week. That traffic must be a blast to drive in I like that one green spot. Like that. That is where I shall live!Awesome shot. It always blows my mind when I see non-US cities (as an American). I think Chicago or Charlotte or LA are huge, but they don't hold a candle to the size of some foreign cities. 

EDIT: 

Been getting some responses that seem to be questioning my inclusion of Charlotte. Please note that I included it because not only do I live here and love this city but I figured size-wise it is about the same as a lot of other American cities with the exception of the big three and would make a good reference point when comparing to non-American cities. 

Here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown:

I went to Tokyo a few years back and it was absolutely amazing.  I was in Shinjuku and it was so nice and clean and beautiful.  I've been to NYC numerous times and it was so dirty, the streets were disgusting, tons of homeless people, just total noise pollution from cars hoking etc.  During my stay in Tokyo, over i think it was 4 days, I heard a total of 3 car honks.  3 Car honks in 4 days.  I can hear 3 car honks in 3 seconds in New York City.  So many international cities just outclass NYC, yet apparently NYC is a pride of our country.  Joe Biden's comments about LaGuardia airport a while back is really a microcosm of NYC as a whole, it's dirty, disgusting, and inefficient.

> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).

> The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

You heard about Pluto? It's messed up, right?wow. that ""desert"" looking area doesn't have impact craters... does that mean that there is sufficient sediment transport (wind?) on the Pluto to cover up those impacts??? simply fascinating.

**Ken**: Ray, you are about the worst tourist in the whole world.  
**Ray**: Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me but I didn't, so it doesn't.I want that experience with every inch of my body.  How do the waffles taste with home-field advantage?Belgian here. The sugared waffle and strawberry combo you'll be able to find at pretty much every local market. Most will have a waffle stand.

Places to see when visiting:

* Ypres and the entirety of the 'Westhoek' especially nowadays with the 100 year anniversary of WW1. There are plenty of memorial sites here so you might even find a family member. Well preserved remnants of trenches, and some very nice museums.

* While you're in this area the coast isn't too long of a drive. It's a huge tourist trap but if you want try Belgian mussels then you'll find the best on the coast. All sorts of freshly caught fish and seafood can be bought on the dike at around 4-5 pm in the afternoon, when the boats come back in.

* Some of our cities have a very rich history. Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp for example were economical powerhouses in the medieval times and you still get to visit old guild houses and the like. Tongeren on the other hand is the oldest Belgian city and dates back to Roman times. Tongeren has a nice Gallo-Roman museum that sheds light on both cultures living together and merging within Belgian borders.

Local cuisine to try out. Most of it has a very countryside and homely feel to it.

* 'French' fries. Really, these things are Belgian and every town will have at least a few 'frietkoten', places that specialize in only selling French fries and other deep-fried stuff that goes with it. I recommend asking the locals for a good place. It's tough to find a place that sucks but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference in quality.

* Chocolate. If you find a chocolate shop you should definitely go and buy some real Belgian pralines. High price, but worth experiencing.

* Mussels. Best place to order this is obviously the coast, so you're guaranteed they're as fresh as can be. Most often served with fries, a bit of mayonnaise, and a special sauce just for the mussels. The mussels are basically cooked in a stewy vegetable soup with lots of spices. Shrimp are also a very loved local seafood.

* Beef carbonnade, locally known as 'stoofvlees'. I personally dislike it but most Belgians freaking love it. The sauce is often prepared with some heavy beer like a Trappiste or Tripel.

* On that note, the beer. There's a huge variety here. Some people love Jupiler, others the heavier Duvel. We have all sorts of white, blonde, and dark beers as well as fruity 'chick' beers. I'm not much of a beer guy myself but I fucking love a cold Stella Artois. Some places especially in the city will specialize in serving as many different beers as possible and they'll even serve them in the correct glass. Worth asking around if there's such a place where you're visiting. You can drink an afternoon away just exploring tastes if you're not careful.

* Other stuff I can't be bothered to describe anymore: *waterzooi, paling in't groen, pensen, ...*

* My personal favourite: *kiekerenbloed*, literally chicken's blood, which is exactly the main ingredient. It's a *very* local dish that's made by (as far as I know) mixing chicken's blood with bacon grease and baking it, then serving it with a sandwich and a dollop of mustard. [Some gentlemen enjoying a pint and a plate of kiekerenbloed.](http://i.imgur.com/ZO3UeHm.jpg)Fucking Bruges.Someday I'd like to retire to Belgium and live entirely on waffles and fries.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/vanished.shtmlFour years ago I spent a couple days in the Dolomites at Passo Brocon in northern Italy. I took a long day hike up the mountains above the hotel and found a WW1 gunnery nest. It was mid-September and already pretty damn cool up there. I jumped inside the nest and looked around. The soldiers had a nice view of the area, but they were also totally exposed. The wind whipped over the little hilltop. Then came a sudden thunderstorm. I had nowhere to hide and got completely soaked. As I high-tailed it down the mountain to my hotel, I thought about those soldiers who were stuck in that nest in winter. Holy shit, that would have SUCKED. 

I got hot coffee and drove the 17 miles to town to get new shoes (mine were muddy and filthy). Those soldiers couldn't. They were stuck in the frozen mud for weeks at a time. And now some of them are unearthing. >the remains of two Austrian soldiers found on the Presena Glacier in 2012. Photo: Office for Archaeological Finds, Autonomous Province of Trento

Captain Italia looks like he needs a little time to readjust They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and terrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Otto von Bismarck had ""ended"" (after a hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army to aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir of Bismarck.

Goede actie.Just an FYI to the folks who are confused about hypoglycemia...most likely this woman has diabetes, probably Type I which is insulin dependent. Anyone who has this knows what a royal pain in the rear it is...constantly checking your blood sugar, adjusting your food intake, insulin intake, activity level to attempt to simulate a non-diabetic's blood sugar. Even with constant vigilance, your blood sugars can dip low or go high, for sometimes unknown reasons (is this infusion set on my insulin pump blocked? I worked a little harder raking the leaves and didn't eat enough...I have a cold, maybe that's why my glucose is high? Etc). Managing the disease is a total balancing act. This mom prob went into hypoglycemia because it was dinner time and she was going to eat soon but her blood sugar dropped too low before she got a chance to eat,and she got confused or was behaving abnormally or became unresponsive. Scary stuff. I am glad the police helped her out like they did. Serious respect for these guys. They're the model that all policeman should follow.

Also I hope at least one of them is single.And these are the guys that had to fight and go on strike to get a better CAO (collective agreement), incomprehensible. Goeie jongens.Most of redditors are from Netherlands.I was reading this thinking ""Woah! This is totally unheard of!   ... Oh, Netherlands, well then it makes sense""

Edit: I was just expressing my initial reaction to reading this. You're all right of course, that there are plenty of American police with good intentions, and it gets drowned out by either bad cops or just that it's hard to be nice when you're surrounded by gang violence...  FTP - Fix The Police ... And also inner-city/organized crimeIf this had happened in the United States the woman would have hired a lawyer and sued the cops, their department, and the city.  Well when the crime rate is so low you don't have a couple dozen report/complaint calls stacked up to go to after the current one (not to mention whenever high priority calls come in in-between) you've got time to cook dinner and do dishes. 

 Personally, I think the good cops (not the minority haring trigger happy ones) would have a much better time at ""community relations"" if they were better staffed or crime was lower.  This is probably why old people remember friendly cops who they got to know and such. Those cops has fewer calls and more time to reach out.Tijd om 112 te bellen! Ik ruik m'n afwas vanaf hier...Not gunna lie, hypoglycemia is a bitch. I lived in Eindhoven for a while and can honestly say it's one of my favourite places, if only because everyone seemed so nice and welcoming. A great country where the police doesn't have much work to do.The dutch police is awesome. I often go to big festivals in the Netherlands... and the police is always in a good mood and I've seen many times police officers dancing to the music ;-)","{'Extraversion': 0.682, 'Sadness': 0.047402, 'Analytical': 0.107, 'Disgust': 0.061973, 'Joy': 0.056331, 'Emotional_Range': 0.868, 'Conscientiousness': 0.123, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Tentative': 0.192, 'Openness': 0.18, 'Anger': 0.782133, 'Agreeableness': 0.627, 'Fear': 0.995135}"

Sample text from page 1, see page 2 fire some more cool pictures:

> Jeeps were produced and packed this way for shipment to U.S. forces and countries like England and the Soviet Union who the U.S. supplied during WW II. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Richmond, CA, about 70% of production was boxed due to their close proximity to the San Francisco port.

> Boxing up a jeep was expensive and time consuming so it was only done when absolutely necessary. Jeeps that were crated were complete vehicles, not a box of parts — windshields were folded, wheels taken off and a few other things done to minimize the cubeage. Very few, if any, of these crated jeeps remained in the United States, even during the war. After more than sixty years, there are probably none left. Several organizations and dealers have had a substantial reward offer for years for anyone who can produce one and no one has claimed the money.

PartMy grandfather once bought a used amusement park ride on e-bay, and it came in a single package like this. Obviously it was much larger, delivered on a flatbed tractor trailer.

My family spent a couple weeks helping him assemble it in our corn field, but we had to stop just short of completion when it became clear that it wasn't a theme park ride, but some gigantic animatronic roadside advertisement for a Venezuelan brothel.Americans left a bunch of these behind in the Philippines after WW2 and filipinos turned it into an episode of Project Runway.Ikea supplies the military now?Fun fact: The tire tread on the jeep is designed so that it is difficult to tell which direction the vehicle was headed if you encounter a set of tracks.[75 years old this year!](http://m.imgur.com/1zXPME0?r)The orginal jeep was pretty amazing.

Yes, there is roughly 100 left in other countries. But the minimum viable population for any species is generally between 50-150. That means this species is extremely close to being doomed to die out. I'm not associated with the WWF or any related organisations, and I would encourage anyone to do their own research before donating, but I hope at least one person will consider it.

There are still more Sumatran rhinos in Sumatra and Borneo.

And you'd think reddit hates China or something. Sumatran rhinos aren't often poached. And even if they are, Chinese people don't typically make viagras out of rhino's ivory.I'm just surprised the little guy has hair.Fuck humansJust to clarify why rhinos (in general) are going extinct, and why it will happen so quickly: Of course, one of the larger factors is poaching, and is probably one of the easiest for you all to donate towards. Because of this poaching, scientists have essentially been forced to breed rhinos in a way that does not promote genetic diversity (we don't want to say that they are essentially inbred, but they are almost clones of each other). Because of the lack of genetic variance, any small thing (diseases, disruption in food source, geographic dislocation, etc.) will pretty much wipe them off the face of the earth. 

Also, in case you didn't know, cheetahs are in the same boat. Although their numbers in the wild are relatively large at the moment, any small disease could wipe out wild cheetahs in the next year.One day in the future kids are going to find it hard to believe that animals once lived in the wild and that the wild used to consist of something more than a fucking Walmart parking lot.

If I knew that a calf had frozen to death slowly over the course of a day and a half, I would feel tremendous guilt. The feelings would be overwhelming. Soup's on!Bad memories... We'd put our animals together and every house will herd them respectively in our village. The herders were always some kids escorted by adults.

Dafoe has a certain kind of crazy look that befits Two Face's identity crisis a lot better. He pulled it off well with Green Goblin and a more comic-version of Two Face (who acts a bit different from movies and games) would suit Dafoe really well, I think.

He could probably do Joker crazy just fine too, but I think Two Face would end up coming out better.Simple, his dick is too big.Already been the Green Goblin.Easy - he doesn't want his ass kicked.

He'd be waaay too convincing and the next thing you know, the real Batman is showing up at his place throwing elbows and grunting all throatily. How about for a Batman Beyond movie?He can't be.

Edit: sometime around 2 am, I was woken up by a low moan that had a slightly aggressive tone to it (the moan lasted about 10 seconds). I grew up near mountains and cows and had never heard anything like that before. 

It freaked me out and I went from dead asleep to pulse racing at maximum just about instantly. I sat up and thought and listened for maybe 10 seconds then I flung open the tent and ran for the truck. I was wearing only underwear and the truck was 50ft away. I made it and rolled down the window a bit to look and listen. 

I had no weapons on me.

Total, I camped out there in the same spot for 3 months and this happened about half way through.

Years later, I listened to mountain lion sounds on YouTube and confirmed that it was a lion. He was maybe 20 to 50 ft from my tent and I think he was kindof asking a question. He was curious and wanted to see what I was. I never saw him and never heard him again.Where was this taken?

http://spillmybeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-parking-problems-comic-picture.jpgWhen I was a kid my dog got really sick and we rushed her to the vet. My dad parked shittily like the guy in your pic because he was in such a hurry to get the dog looked at. The dog died while we were in there and when we left someone had left a note under my dad's wiper saying he was an asshole for parking like that. I never saw my dad look as defeated as he did in that moment.

TL;DR - You never know what someone else is dealing with. I'm getting a beer.[deleted]That is clearly a tortoiseKeep in mind, it is not fair to judge someone's parking ability if you don't actually watch them as they are parking. It is pretty likely that the car you are looking at was forced to park like this due to someone else being parked improperly next to them.In High School, the girl who parked in front of me was 1-2 feet into my spot EVERY FUCKING DAY. I just let it go, but by the end of the year, I was like whatever, I'll leave a funny note. 

""Just so you know  -- (insert drawn picture of a ruler with an arrow pointing at the 12 inch mark)

you were this far into my spot every day this year. 

Best of luck with your future parking endeavors.""

She then made a point to yell ""asshole"" out the window at me whenever she saw me from that point on -- obviously not finding it as funny as I did. This is an incredibly passive aggressive way to behave.

I'm not a fan.I still don't understand why Reddit has such an obsession with people parking their cars badly.

Also, I think it's pretty fucking weird to type up some ""clever"" memo and put it on a stranger's car.

But, I'm very aware I'm in the minority here.Where can I find this online so I can print 100 and fulfill my destiny as a passive aggressive parking vigilante?i dont know whats worse. a shitty parker or someone who puts childish notes on cars that may or may not park shitty. /r/passiveaggressive/","{'Extraversion': 0.727, 'Sadness': 0.14609, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.492493, 'Joy': 0.037939, 'Emotional_Range': 0.945, 'Conscientiousness': 0.035, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Tentative': 0.683, 'Openness': 0.125, 'Anger': 0.987751, 'Agreeableness': 0.517, 'Fear': 0.485343}"

We can still tip but the tip jar is near the register and probably need to ask for it.

The incentive for good service is not getting your ass fired while someone else takes you reasonably paying job.Wow, this thread is amazing-- thanks for the attention, everyone!  My little restaurant is flattered.  Just wanted to give you guys (and particularly the servers/ cooks/ restaurant owners out there) more details on what we're doing and how we do it!

First, it's not simply an increased hourly wage!  In addition to fully funded benefits for EVERY employee, full or part time, and $15/ hour, they all get a portion of the sales.  Waitstaff get 12% of their individual sales (remember, servers used to tip out 6% of their sales, so that's like a guaranteed 18% from every table, including takeout.)  Kitchen & support staff get a percentage of the shift's sales, depending on their roles. 

It's removed the judgement, assumptions, and emotions that living off tips entailed; my servers love that.  And of course I don't take any cash they DO receive; if they do so well that someone wants to reward them extra, more power to them, that's theirs to keep.  And it happens... because my staff is incredible :)  

Come visit us in San Francisco sometime!Reddit loves a great tipping thread, but what this restaurant is saying is that ALL of their staff (bussers, dishwashers, cooks &amp; servers) are paid a living wage.  Kudos.

Serving is tough, but the kitchen is just as valuable to the dining experience. The restaurant that I work at pays minimum wage, we get tipped, but we also get profit sharing. We also get fully funded health, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) with employer match and discounts to climbing gyms and other places to boot. 

I enjoy working there.Are there any servers here that wouldn't be okay with this? My friend is a server and she says she regular makes $20+ / hour when you average her tips, and closer to $30 if she does that thing that absolutely no servers do - not reporting their tips to the IRS. That is a sweet benefits package I must say, but she's told me she'd quit serving if she ever averaged less than $20 / hr.Picture of a menu. I like the Italian way: no obligation, no forced tips, no shared jar. You liked the service exceptionally? Leave some extra money on the table when you leave. Your waiter will take it completely for himself.Redditor: ""Instead of a tip I have left you with this informative card which expains how the tip system exploits the lower class."" <tips fedora> ""M'lady.""So basically it's like how restaurants work in the entire rest of the world. USA takes another step forward!I hate the tip system in the U.S. 

As a black person, whenever I go to a restaurant, they think I won't tip, so they give me poor service. This leads me to want to tip poorly, but I still always give at least 15%. 

I wish tip wasn't part of it and it was just a fixed price.Sounds better than 

**35% Tip included in Menu Prices**so 20% markups are already included in the prices.I just went here! Really good. Really french waitress. That's OK. I'll take my tipping position which averages me around 30-35/hr.Move to Europe LOL Zazie is in SF. They're required by law to provide health insurance. It's also a California law to provide Paid Sick Leave. ""Living Wage,"" which is how much exactly? Because SF is fucking expensive and their poverty wage would go pretty far in Sacramento. I know I'm in the minority here, but I *like* the practice of tipping. It's one of the few times where I can, unilaterally, decide the value of a good or service **after** getting it. 

At the couple of restaurants where I show up at fairly regularly, I always get excellent service, they remember what I like, and treat me like I'm a valued customer. And I'm not by any means rich nor do I tip more than a pretty typical amount. 

I'd actually be disappointed to have tipping taken out of the equation in a lot of places. Define living wage...This is actually a great restaurant too. Good food, nice wine, neat ambiance. I've taken a few dates here. It's a nice spot if you find yourself in Cole Valley, SF. I'm glad we don't have tipping where I live.The fact remains that, at a flat daily wage, a busy day is worse for a waiter than a slow day.

The tip system, with all its flaws, does achieve one thing. It makes wait staff *want* the place to be bustling. It puts management and employees on the same page, keeping the place as busy as possible is how everybody gets their payday. 

When a waiter gets tips, they see a large party coming through the door and they get excited. When they don't, they see a large party coming through the door and they sigh. More work, same pay.As a hospitality worker in SF, this is as outrageous as it is hilarious.  They pay their employees $15 an hour, sounds like a lot for other parts of the country, but keep in mind that is set to be our *minimum* wage by 2017 (current minimum wage is $12.25).  Saying that is a livable wage for a restaurant in the Bay Area, nevertheless in SF itself is simply not true.  The total cost of living in San Francisco is 62.6% higher than the U.S. average, and we have the most brutal real estate/rent situation in the country right now (http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2015/06/02/san-franciscos-median-rent-hits-a-ridiculous-4225/)
A tipped position in the Bay Area allows you to make double or more than what they are paying.  Also, while I encourage them to let people know they are providing benefits and doing what ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY, but specifically discouraging any extra gratuities is silly and will hurt service in the long run.  They will lose real talent because competent and hospital servers/bartenders that go above and beyond will leave because working here is basically getting payed what you would at McDonalds.Tipping culture always confused me when I was younger and I used to visit the US a lot, having grown up in England. Here its basically set up as mentioned in the sign and the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour (although it's set to increase to £9.00 an hour) plus the government will pitch in quite generously in terms of benefits if you're stuck on minimum wage (but waiting staff normally are not, depending on the establishment). Saves a whole lot of hassle when paying though... And if you want to tip on top of that you can: for exemplary service.","{'Extraversion': 0.599, 'Sadness': 0.05259, 'Analytical': 0.37, 'Disgust': 0.05457, 'Joy': 0.060894, 'Emotional_Range': 0.788, 'Conscientiousness': 0.173, 'Confident': 0.081, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Openness': 0.222, 'Anger': 0.956596, 'Agreeableness': 0.624, 'Fear': 0.049403}"

Link related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter

Also, I heard a story of a student who was in a class where the teacher allowed students to only write on one side of a sheet. He twisted the sheet and attached it to itself as a Möbius strip.I always loved note-card allowed exams. I thought I was getting one over on the teacher (Hah! I wrote suuuuper small, take that!) but I always ended up learning more of the material because I actually spent time studying by putting together my card.I had a classmate in high school peel the index card apart into layers and then print off typed notes to paste on each layer. The kid ended up with like 5 extra sides on his notes. The teacher was so astounded that a 16 year old would think of this that he allowed the kid to use the note card.  From then on out, that teacher clearly stated that this isn't allowed. Talk about interpretating the rules haha.

PS: Forgive my grammar mishaps (I know its interpreting), as the drunken redneck within me came out last night.My Differential Equations professor always used to say, you may use one piece of paper. If you are creative enough, you can use all 6 sides.When they wear them on each eye the answers pop out in 3DThis kid is going placesWhy the hell aren't they printing a 3x5 notecard in 3 point fonts and bringing reading glasses?Story time:

There was a legend in the math department at my college that a professor allowed students to use an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper full of notes for the final exam.  The only problem was that the prof didn't specify units of measurement so some smart-ass (or possibly genius) student got a hold of a sheet of butcher paper that was 8 1/2 FEET by 11 FEET.  Since the prof hadn't specified units of measurement, he ended up letting the kid use it, but from then on he always made sure to say that an 8 1/2 INCH by 11 INCH sheet of paper could be used for notes on the final.

I will say that your student's method of bending the rules is far more creative and less smartassy than the student in my story.I did something similar, except for a multivariable calculus final. We were allowed both sides of a 5"" × 7"" notecard. So I wrote out my notes first horizontally on the card, then turned the card 90° and wrote in a different color on both sides again.
So long as you use colors that are markedly different and not too dark, it works well.So that kid gets an A for being a genius right?The thing I remember most about these notecard style exams is that most of the stuff I wrote down I ended up remembering just from the act of taking the time to write it.  I ended up just using the card to double-check stuff so I didn't feel I made it in vain.Where was this post a couple days ago? I could have used this on my final.I had a teacher specifically forbid this because she had seen it before. Playing with legos all the time (and hunting for the right color part in a mixed bin) as a kid developed in me the ability to ""blur out"" all colors but the one I'm looking for. I have done this with six colors and no lenses. Works great.THE MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELLThat's some jimmy newton shitAh, but you didn't say they could also use red and blue strips of plastic for filters.  ""A"" for creativity, but abject failure for the crime of NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. My teachers in college said that we could use our books during the exam. Whenever that happened, everyone realized that the exam was going to be so hard that the books wouldn't even be helpful. Sadly to say, this was indeed the case.A teacher once told my class to ""only use a 3 by 5 note card."" My best friend came in with a huge piece of paper made of other papers taped together with most the chapter written on it. The teacher asked what he thought he was doing so my friend explained that she never specified 3 by 5 inches and that his paper was 3 by 5 feet. He said it was still 3 by 5 so he was still following the rules. She let him get away with it but never forgot to say inches after that.","{'Extraversion': 0.404, 'Sadness': 0.31355, 'Analytical': 0.208, 'Disgust': 0.938878, 'Joy': 0.041794, 'Emotional_Range': 0.713, 'Conscientiousness': 0.254, 'Confident': 0.106, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Openness': 0.402, 'Anger': 0.826095, 'Agreeableness': 0.6, 'Fear': 0.783487}"

You can (and people do) climb all over the stones. 

I spent the night at Stonehenge for summer solstice 7 years ago. There were some Druid rituals - I remember a parade with flaming torches and giant furry animal heads - but mostly people were just there to party. There were drum circles everywhere, some food vendors, and lots of drinking and smoking. 

Unfortunately, it drizzled the whole time, so we didn't get to see the sunrise through the stones. But I was glad the weather forced me to wear wellies, because man, those porta potties grew increasingly biohazardous as the night wore on. Edit to change my opinion. Apparently they trash it every year and it's kinda sad. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11455098/Stonehenge-damaged-with-chewing-gum-and-graffiti-during-Winter-Solstice.htmlMy dad said that when he was a kid in the 60's, stonehenge was just this random thing off the highway, with one tiny little sign, and you just parked on the highway shoulder and walked over to it.  You could climb on it, there was some small graffiti on it, and nobody cared, because there was nobody there.

We went again as a family in 2006, and you had to park in a parking lot far away, pay an entry fee, walk through this long underground tunnel that took you underneath the highway with a bunch of infographics on the walls, then you come to stonehenge and it's all roped off with velvet and you just slowly walk around it in a circle with the group, stopping occasionally to take pictures.They left that place in ruins.This is why we can't have nice things.

What a bunch of fucking arseholes.Funny, they didn't look Druish.As a janitor, I'm impressed. After that many people this looks pretty tame. Is no one in this thread able to realise that most of the 23,000 aren't hippies and are just party-goers?also, plenty of other people. I mean, if you've got 23,000 people, some subset of them are gonna be assholes no matter what.

You could probably make this title 23,000 gamers, white people and self-stylied atheists and be equally as accurate.*Shocking* that a group of 23k people left trash on the ground. 20k out of the 23k could have cleaned up all their mess and you're still left with the mess of 3k people. >Claims to celebrate and respect the earth

>Leaves a bunch of paper/petrol-based garbage at an ancient Druid heritage site.http://i.imgur.com/tNx7nB4.gifI went to Stonehenge a few years ago and they had a rope fence up about a hundred feet from the stones because people vandalized the stones. 
then people do shit like this, nothing pisses me off more than seeing a place people hold sacred trashed by 23k of the absolute scum of society. I think most of them aren't really hippies or druids, just people who like a party.Gotta love that Hipster hypocrisy ;) ""But man, we love mother earth! She is so beautiful, lets throw our trash all over it.""

You've missed the photo where loads of people stayed behind to clear up. This is disgusting.If anyone's ever been they'll know it's mainly populated by local chavs looking for an excuse to get wrecked. Not trying to defend their actions here but I bet if you put a group of 23000 of anybody it would look the same.I was there for the whole event and I can tell you there were people from all social circles. There were plenty of new-agers and hippies but they were heavily outnumbered by the general public.

The event is part of a religious holiday that's open to anyone and although there were volunteers picking litter, you have to expect some debris from 23,000 people moving in and around the stones.

Otherwise it was an absolutely electric night, people chanting, playing bongos and dancing around the circle into the early hours was amazing to see. I even saw a guy playing a saxophone to one of the stones.I was there

I am there every year

Loads of local chavs and non hippies turn up to get fucked up and ruin the vibe. Don't blame the hippies because we make up less than half of the people there - after the sunrise all the non-hippies leave and then you'll see what the summer solstice celebrators are really like!I was there at the 2015 summer Solstice, I was there with my friends just to see what all the hype was about. And as far as I could tell the people doing all the damage was not the druids and people there for the religous ceremony but the people who  were there to get smashed and take drugs in a field. It was basically like Reading Festival Campsite, and if anyone has ever seen a festival campsite after the festival has finished it looks exactly like this.Japanese druids would never let this happen.

7.Please for the love of God neighbours if you can hear me bring chainsaws

Though fairly commonly, they're somewhat rarely seen because of their relatively short week-long adulthood. During this period of their lifespan, they do not have mouths, as a result do not eat, and exist solely to procreate.This obviously was staged by the moths for the sake of bankrupting the butterflies.

It's cafeteria in TCS, an IT company. Many companies display such data in the cafeterias.We did this at my summer camp to make kids aware of food wastefulness and not taking more than they'd eat. Went from over 150 lbs of wasted food the first day down to 45 by the end of camp. Guess they're also serving up guilt there.Near me there are a few ""All You Can Eat Sushi"" spots.

They will not serve you more until you clear everything on your plate. If you don't eat everything that came out, you can't order more. You also can't take it home.

This actually pissed me off the one time I went there with some people a while back. They make you order as a table. I'm very specific with sushi, so I ordered 2 or 3 specific rolls for myself, but when I finished they wouldn't let me order more because the table wasn't finished.

You see, the other people at my table were ... well ... idiots. They thought, ""Hey, it's all you can eat! Lets just order everything, even the stuff that doesn't sound appealing!"". 

They ordered more food than anyone could eat, didn't end up finishing it, and as a result I couldn't order more. I even asked the waitress if I could go on my own separate bill, to which they said, ""One table, one bill"".

They wasted a ton of food that night, and I was probably the only person in the history of an ""all you can eat"" restaurant who went home hungry.250g doesn't sound like a particularly big meal for those 180 peopleTata Consultancy Services. Our motto: ""I'm not a doctor, but I'll take a look.""You sure this is a restaurant? Looks more like an office cafeteria [deleted]In general,  the solution would be to switch to smaller plates. People are lazy and they will avoid doing many trips to the bar. That is the ugliest number 5 I've ever seen. Fuck I'm tired. I originally saw wastage and thought that this was written in German or something However, that wouldnt have actually fed anyone. It instead saves the company money and gives them more profit. They are playing on your emotions for their gain.

Im a little cranky this morning apparently lol.[In other words: Don't do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCLXZmMQNs)i know some all you can eat places get around this by charging a fee if your plate isnt empty when you ask for the bill. which i think is perfectly acceptable, wasting food is a shame. 

edit: to the people whining, or saying what if i have 1 shrimp on my plate, use some common sense people. if you have a few small items, or stuff half eaten cause you didn't like it you wont be charged normally. it's the people who've had 3 plates are pretty full but think they can do one more round fill a plate and leave it half full. 

and to the people saying how do they charge you for it? well buffets are a set price, when your bill comes there will be a fee on top, it's not rocket science.. I wonder if this is 100% actual foods that you could have actually fed 180 people with or if they just weighed the waste bin... It's ironic this is a sign at Tata. Fuck this company and everything it stands for.But is it gonna feed 180 people, if it wasn't wasted? What are they gonna do with leftovers at the end of the day?A retaurant in my town makes you pay double if they see you wasting too much food. If you don't pay, they kick you out. Not like we would waste anything on the first place, but there will always be assholes.We did a similar thing when I went to school. The cafeteria had a clear tube that red balls were placed in for every x kilo thrown in the waste baskets. There was also a mark on the tube, and if we were lower than the mark by the end of the year, everyone would get ice cream.Do they weigh just the edible waste or are they including bones and shells?  If the former, who's separating these?  They should also post their profit for full transparencyTCS...   the sweatshop of the consultancy world...Buffet by definition is wasteful, they can take their side order of guilt and shove it. I wonder how effective this sign is...I love the ""do it for the environment"" or ""do it for starving people"" marketing...when it is really ""do it so that we can reduce our costs"".

The kid on the right, on top of the van taking the picture, looks like it was photoshoped. I lived in South Africa for years. There is almost zero chance these are ""commuters"". This is almost certainly inside a park, and those cars are tourists specifically there looking for lions and other wildlife. Look at all the cameras. Lions don't just wander around Africa. They are very rare and highly prized tourist attractions, and they're in very specific, fenced (but extremely large, think hundreds, or even thousands of square miles) areas.

Africa is not huts and wildlife. Africa has cell phones and shopping malls and McDonalds and Adam Sandler movies, same as everywhere else.Nice BALLSMust not have been any dentists near the front of the lineNairobi is the only city in the world to have a national park right next to the city. People who live close to the park have at times encountered cheetahs and hyenas when coming back home from a night out. So yeah, lions can sometimes show up outside the park. But it isn't a common occurrence, though. TIL Nairobi drivers need laser pointers. Fucking cats man ... They do whatever they want and dont care who they inconvenience. Place a potted plant on a table in the middle of the Savannah with nothing around it for miles and you bet your ass a fucking lion will show up and knock it over.Those people in the front line of cars with their windows open, very ballsy.Lion 1:  They're totally looking at my ass aren't they?

""Oh I take photos of waves before they fucking destroy me""I grew up swimming in the Pacific Ocean, that force that pulls you out to sea and builds this wave is ridiculous! And when a wave like that hits you dead on it feels like a train and it can smash you into the bottom of the sea instantly.

Some of the best memories I had growing up were in the ocean. Some of the worst memories I had were also in the ocean. Looks like the waves in Japanese paintings
As a surfer, I can say with accuracy that he's going to have a bad time.Clark Little is the friendliest dude!

 These are good dreams. 

[Shore breaks](https://youtu.be/EUXOZAinUPk)  
Other interesting facts about shore breaks.  
EDIT: Being from Hawaii I've thankfully learned how to duck dive under any wave, especially shorebreaks. As the name of the wave suggests, a shore break is a wave that breaks obviously close to shore. In my years of living in Hawaii I've probably seen a dozen of deaths because they either don't duck dive and get slammed from the peak down towards the sand or worse, rocks and reef. Another reason people die is that they stand at the bottom of the peak and get slammed with pounds of water causing back injuries or worse paralysis. It is fun to bodyboard or bodysurf these types of waves, however do it at your own risk. Learn to duck dive, never be afraid of a wave again.YEEZY YEEZY WHAT'S GOODI made this video piece about Clark a couple years ago, if anyone's interested in knowing a little more. Dude is insanely talented.

Fox did something similar.I was taking my dog for a walk the other day, and this is his first full summer so he really hasn't seen fireflies I don't think.

Any idea how many were in the jar? I can't decide if that's a shitton of fireflies or if it was just a few who were moving around a whole lot.I feel terrible about the wiffle bat genocide I inflicted on these little guys when I was a kid.

http://imgur.com/PLdA307Brooklyn Supreme is NOT the world's biggest horse!

The ""biggest"" horse on record is Sampson, a Shire horse 21.2 hands high by the time he was a four year old, when he was re-named Mammoth. His peak weight was estimated at 3,360 lb.  He was born in 1846, before Brooklyn was ever born.

Brooklyn ""only"" stood 19.2 hands high.  

The record-holder for ""biggest horse"" as of 2007 was a Shire horse named Tina who was 20 hands high.  Tina died in 2008 and was subsequently beaten by Big Jake, who is 20 hands *plus two and three-quarter inches* and still alive, holding the current record.  Big Jake weighs only 2,600 pounds compared to Sampson, but Guinness no longer records ""biggest"" by weight, but by height, so although Jake is much trimmer than either Brooklyn or Sampson, he still holds the title.

Edit: a ""hand"" is 4 inches.

A few questions,

-What are people supposed to do when you live this close to an active volcano? 

-Does the media play a positive or negative part when something like this happens?

-Can lava melt steel beams?Anyone want a quick volcanology lesson? Heres how this type of eruption works. Inside the mountain is a magma chamber, filled with liquid magma under pressure. In this magma are gasses dissolved inside it. Think of it like a bottle of soda, when you look at the liquid, it's just liquid; but when you release the pressure, the gasses come out and bubble up out the liquid. Same principle in this type of volcano. When the pressure gets too high in the chamber an eruption begins and the gasses in the magma are released out of the magma just like in the soda bottle. But the gasses also bring with it some magma that is quickly solidified into particles as the gas escapes, this is the volcanic ash. So the huge cloud you see is a combination of volcanic gasses and particulate magma known as ash, and at very high temperatures non the less. As the pressure in the magma chamber comes down the eruption slows down, and when the pressure has been relieved the eruption ends. Not a volcanologist, so this info is my synthesis of a complicated process from when I wanted to learn how this worked one day, and is a very basic explanation. [here is a time lapse Video of the erupting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljrDn3Gel4M)[deleted]Calbuco is the name of the volcano. That picture is the view from Puerto Montt.This image is both amazing an scary. Stay safe.[Oooh @_@](http://i.imgur.com/awyhPkT.gif)Earth here, happy fucking Earth day. Best photo I've seen today.

"" Well, that can't be good.""   Then the lame laugh track in my head erupts in guffaws........... I'm so lonely.  :-<[deleted]uh so why is this not covered on like any major news network in the U.S.?It looks like the ash hit a ceiling and it had to go out instead of up. Shouldn't you be running, rather than taking (amazing) pics of this?Can you imagine living in the ancient world and seeing something like this? Dang.Flip that photo upside down, and that's what my ass would be doing if I was there.It's annoyed me for a long time how no-one ever seems to take high-res pictures of volcanic eruptions. I just want a desktop background, is that too much to ask?I made a 3D Web Scene of the volcano with data before this eruption.

Petra is in Jordan pretty easy to visit ([here's me last March!](http://imgur.com/fbYjQ6q)), and is safe to visit even in the current Middle Eastern climate, but these tombs just across the border are *really* hard to visit.  That's because tourism visas don't exist in Saudi Arabia, and what's more you need a permit to travel up to this region to see the tombs, and the Saudis are not really willing to grant them because these tombs are pre-Islam.

So if you want to see stuff like this, go to Petra- you won't regret it, I promise!http://imgur.com/mnDOjmD5th Element?Can't wait for ISIS to blow it up![From Ancient Times](http://i.imgur.com/sE3RXqw.jpg)[pic with guy removed](http://i.imgur.com/6ftVsOV.jpg)Pretty damned fascinating.

The part that really made me sad was how much litter there was; even in the most remote of places. I would see plastic bags wedged between rocks and garbage just dumped along the side of the road.

Aside from the crummy stuff, the one thing I do have to mention about Saudi Arabia: they have the best damned fried chicken in the world.Aziz, light!Created by the Nabateans; the same people who built Petra, in Jordan.Diablo 2, act 2Does this site have a name?God. Someone somewhere in history looked at this rock and said ""carve that shit for me when I die fam"".

Between sunrise and sunset we have only 2 .5 hours of light.

What's crazy is that Minnie Mae outlived pretty much all of her family--Elvis,  Vernon, they all died before her. Dang, if you need a wikipedia image for ""withering stare"" this pic will probably do the trick.That haircut isn't regulation at all...but it should be.His dad looks like the T-1000 traveled back and ate too many peanut butter banana sandwiches> **milk**

Concise and accurate. Excellent marketing.If anyone is wondering what patch he is wearing, it's the patch of the 3rd Armored Division(Tank Division)Interesting that Minnie has a hairstyle suited to the 20s and 30s. Kinda like our grandma's nowadays have hairstyles from the 50s and 60s. Man, Elvis was a damn stud.Elvis is the coolest motherfucker there ever was. His dad looks like a bad ass too, and grandma looks like she's gonna whup the photographer's ass for taking pictures at the dinner table. Minnie Mae straight out of American Gothicthe wrong kid died!I miss the way foods were labeled in the 50s. What it was was more important than who made it. A tin of black pepper. A carton of milk. A box of... premiums.Pretty sure that's Ray Liotta Elvis guy here.

What strikes me is how modest the setting here is.  At this point Elvis was the biggest name in the world, with multiple #1 records and hit movies. He was already a pioneer in music (with several ""first"" concept albums already done) and basically the most famous entertainer in the world.

By 1959, Elvis beloved mama was dead and Vernon had already remarried (a woman who quickly asserted herself as the new matriarch of the family, much to Elvis' displeasure. She and Vernon lived in GRaceland with Elvis for a time but after she rearranged the furniture and changed the drapes, which Gladys had picked out, Elvis moved all her stuff out and sent her down the road to live with Vernon in a nearby house).


It's unclear to me where this picture was taken but it doesn't appear to be Graceland. The house changed a lot between 57-77 but this doesn't look anything I've seen. It may be Vernonshouse.

The point is, despite already having an obscene amount of money and a willingness to spend it freely on his loved ones, the  environment here is still so modest. It's partially because of the era and partially because. Elvis' family grew up so dirt poor that even this was considered a significant step up.Christ he's photogenic isn't he?Her head looks way too small for her body. She's on the same level as the Koopas in the Mario Bros movie.Was this before or after he stole his iconic dance off Forrest Gump?I bet you that was a damn good breakfast too. Oh, Minnie... You so fine, you so fine you blow my mind.Wow, Vernon looks just like [Robert Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Patrick) who played Johnny Cashs father in Walk the Line.TIL Nabisco hasn't changed the packaging of their saltine crackers in half a century.Thought it said his dad's name was ""Venom"".

I was frustrated at first until he looks up at me and says ""I've been saving my allowance and helping neighbors all year to buy this."" The mother gave me this really apologetic look and says he insisted he pay for it with the money he earned. Was just too cute for me to be angry.As a previous employee of Best Buy, I'm familiar with this type of customer, and there's one thing I can promise you: he complained about how long it took to check out.As a jew this is a little awkwardDont know about the States but in Canada you can refuse payment like that. Anything more than 27 coins I believe.That's a lot of broken parking metersthe guy couldn't have gone to a bank beforehand to exchange the quarters for cash??? what a prick. poor craig robinson...This is what those of us who have cashiered refer to as ""The Baggy"".

The customer approaches you with their purchase(es), perhaps wearing a slight smile and greeting you kindly. You ring up their items, exchanging in some well-worn small talk that you have used over and over again for the past few hours. When you inform the customer of their total, the customer suddenly says, ""I hope you don't mind change.""

And there it is. Before then it had only been heard of in legend, mentioned in the tales of other more seasoned cashiers that have seen every horror of the job. You had scoffed at it then--how badly could a baggy be, after all? But then you see it yourself, unable to help yourself from cringing at the sound of the weight of coinage being dropped upon your counter. You look from The Baggy to the total, and then to the line of customers gathering behind The Baggy Holder.

You realize that you cannot be defeated. Not by this. Certainly not by a pile of coins and the piece of plastic that contains them. You must endure so that one day you are able to tell this tale in hopes to warn another unfortunate soul about the existance of The Baggy.

You open The Baggy with trembling hands and begin the count...the stereotype lives on.Used to work at a movie theater.  Teens would come in and ask to see an R rated movie they were clearly not old enough to see and dump a bag of pennies on my counter and giggle.  So I'd count them.  Slowly.  Purposefully.  They'd begin to get impatient (2 minutes before the movie, hurry up!)  Then I'd ""lose"" count.  Gotta start again.  Finally they would just stand there and fume.  I'd finish, let them know they had enough, then ask for ID.  None of them even bothered to try to bring a fake one.  Booted them out.

Give me pennies, prepare to wait mofo's.The guy counting the quarters is probably thinking *""what the fuck am I doing with my life""*he should have paid with the gold he keeps hidden in a bag around his neck.As a person who works in retail, fuck people like this. This has happened so many times at my store that my manager has told me I don't have to accept large payments that are made with change. Seriously is it so hard to go to the bank and get bills?That is a total dick move. I get if you are proud that you saved up enough quarters to buy an iPod, but stop by the fucking bank first and cash that shit in. Don't make the poor sales guy deal with that shit. Illegal to do that in Canada. You're only allowed to use quarters for purchases up to $10.

** (2) A payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:
(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and
(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

[Source](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/page-1.html#s-8.)What a douche bag. When I was a bank teller a common customer came in with fucking $600 of unsorted change. I tried to explain to him that a branch just 2 miles away had a change sorting machine but we didn't. 

I was also the only teller working for that 2 hours, which is about how long it took me. He also told me that he had counted and I was off by $30. 

I almost quit right there. ... He actually looks like the kind of guy who owns a small, yet successful, chain of laundromats and a handful of vending machines.

Of course, that same look applies to a great number of private investigators as well.  They just usually don't have the quarters like this guy does.

(Polo shirt, not quite physically fit, constantly on phone or internet so as to keep things moving in the business).This guy is being a jerk. He's a grown ass man who could easily go to bank to get his coins counted up and pay with bills.  And yet here he is on his smart phone wasting his and everyone's time.Why did he have to be wearing a kippah? We've come so far. And now we're back at square one.

Oy vey.I know this is never going to get read, but all comments regarding the Jewish stereotype and poor retail worker aside this really reflects poorly on the management.  If I was a supervisor at this Best Buy and I saw this going on I would have pulled this man aside and counted the quarters myself, in an office, while I would have my cashier service other customers.  Just because you have an inconsiderate customer doesn't mean that you should let your other customers and your employees suffer.  Simply tell them ""We are not a bank""and the best buy guy should have taken the extra few minutes and sifted through the  quarters for silver. there was no doubt probably 15-30 silver quarters. tell your boss you need change and swap out a $20 for the silver quarters. would have made the counting of  quarters worth it.While I was in college, a grad student across the hall from me saved up his change from the time he was like 12.  

He bought a 56"" flatscreen with it.  About $2000, all in a giant crayon that weighed probably 200 lbs.  

The Best Buy crew had to count it out at customer service.  Took about three hours.When I was a Supervisor at Best Buy I'd happily go grab the change counter from Ops room and use it count that shit.

Those types of customer are either looking for an argument or think that putting some minimum wage high school kid through the wringer is *fun*. Taking away their fun is the only way to win.Assuming he bought a 16 GB iPad Mini at $329, with tax comes out to roughly $350. This is about 1400 quarters. If the cashier counted the quarters for 15 minutes, he counted about 93 quarters every minute, which is 3 quarters every 2 seconds.

Never opened that window in the 10 years I lived there, but small price for having bats for roommates I guess.Cool.  So, she built her nest in between the screen and the window?  How did she get up in there?  Was there a curtain or something up against the window?  It seems like she'd feel kind of exposed...You can see where they keep their nutsThat's really cute! (altough I heard that in some parts of the US squirrels are more pests than cute animals)You should've had him live stream 24/7 the squirrel nest. I would've done it. I think it's amazing!She probably chose that spot because of  the warmth radiating from the window. That's adorable. Would love it if you kept us posted with progress pics.There was a squirrel that used to climb to the edge of a branch and look through my window and make noises at me while I tried to sleep. I don't know how to make that sentence seem like I'm not crazy.Charge admission to your new ""zoo""It's like an ant farm, but with rodents.I saved a squirrel baby a couple months ago. I found him barely breathing and the mom dead right next to him. Took me 9 days to find a shelter, lazy but at the same time wanted to see him recuperate before I brought him there. I don't trust paws and other entities like them. 

Edit: tried to leave him in my backyard when he was walking again, no squirrel adopted him but now the squirrels in the neighborhood will come up to my porch and take nuts out of my hand.

Double edit: not necessarily lazy just took me a few days to find a place then get time, took 2 hours to drive there. Also, thanks so much for the gold. Nerve thought that would've happened in my life.

http://i.imgur.com/XrNMIAn.jpgWow, how big are these squirrels? They look humongous!*How much is that squirrel in the window?  How much is that squirrel for sale?*Aww so cute even when they look like the rats that they are. Surprises like that are a terrific part of life. I had a dove make a nest in the saddle bag of my bicycle stored on my porch, and so for several months I literally had an inside view to the whole egg laying, chicks hatching, mama feeding, and babies leaving the nest. It was a once in a lifetime experience. I hope your friends have children because this would be fascinating for kids.Now *this* is /r/mildlyinteresting, not that typical shit they post.Do that mama a solid and take some hand warmers too the window or something

Unless the guy who designed it was named Elvin...That's not even a mansion. It's the boathouse at Camp Topridge!

https://localwiki.org/hsl/Camp_Topridge

Now that's what I'm Tolkien about.Honestly, I think that's just a boat house. Or a boat house with a guest cabin. Also known as the Adirondack Architectural style. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Architecture [I knew i'd seen this house somewhere before - Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO6BgrnXcA&t=14m48s)House of Cirdan, the Shipwright.That woodwork is on pointde_lakeThat's a boathouse, not a ""private marina"".Looks like the Adirondacks.This definitely reminds me of the one of the inns in WoW. It's been years so I don't remember its name but it was in the level 10ish+ area near Darnassus.

Edit: I believe it is Auberdine that I am thinking of.But would you live there rent free if you had to give up Facebook? [Let me set the mood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yLjsWTNeE)If my hunt-and-seek games have taught me anything, there's a hidden microfiche in that house, and the boathouse has a spear, a starfish, a watering can, an umbrella, a mirror compact, a kitten, a  fish hook, three scarves, a TV remote, a flowered headband, a baby's rattle, and two pieces of a torn up photo in it.Honest question. What happens if the water level rose/dropped say 5-10 feet? I don't know about this area but around here thats pretty common throughout the year. Does the house float up to compensate? Is nothing kept on the lower level with the dock and they just let that flood? What if it rises over that level? Just curious if anyone knows.I work in this area often. This is Camp Topbridge on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondack Park of NY State. I turned in a quest there once where I had to kill 10 diseased boars.This is no mansion, it's a boathouse. Also a marina is a yacht mooring or harbor, this is probably suitable for a very small uncovered powerboat at most and, more likely, serves primarily to house paddle boats of various kinds.Oh to have money...I see the house in When Marnie Was There.

Please don't tell me you're charging people for photography of this quality. If you are just mucking around and taking photos for friends, that's fine (and I hope you're enjoying yourself!). But you should not be allowing people to put faith in you (and give you probably large sums of money) to document what might be the biggest event in their life when you are clearly not qualified to perform this work.

If you can look past the god-awful quality/sharpness/resolution of the image (are you using consumer gear or a point and shoot?) and even further past the basic compositional errors (have you ever studied any other wedding photography before?) the photos still don't appear to have any of effort put into colour correction, cropping, lens issue correction, or any other kind of post production.

You should be less concerned about slipping in ""clever"" reflections, and actually focus on learning how to use a camera. You are far, far from the point where you should be watermarking your images and calling yourself a professional.

**A** small two-seater Cessna 152 plane crashed into a cemetery early this afternoon.

Search and rescue workers have found two survivors and recovered 300 bodies so far and expect that number to climb as digging continues into the evening.I saw one in person and it literally unsettled me.  It's very very strange looking at it closely; it's like your sense of vision goes a little bit wonky and your point of focus kind of slips and slides off the lines of the fuselage leaving with you a sense that it's unnatural and that even after having examined it closely you're still not sure of its shape, like it wasn't designed by humans.

It was much more advanced than reasonably possible in the 60's, heck, it still is 50 years later and I say that it's the sexiest machine ever built.

EDIT: Didn't intend to insinuate aliens.  Go watch a proper documentary, ya bunch o' loonies!An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.

""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

Seeing these taking off and landing was amazing.  I use to bunk off school to go down the landing lights to watch these fly out. The air shows they had every year allowed you to get up close and talk to the pilots.  Stunning planes! Definite highlight for me at the museum of flight in SeattleYou can view one of these lovely planes at Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.My husband and I were crew chiefs on the KC-135Q model at Beale AFB.  One night we got the call, grabed our mobility bags and headed for the flightline.  We ended up flying to Florida, landing and refueling, took back off and when we got to altitude we called down to Control in Florida, who then placed a call to California to tell them that we were at altitude over Florida.  Then and only then, did the SR take off in California so that we could refuel them over Florida.   That is fast!  When your refuel plane has to be in the air and ready all the way across the country before you can even take off.  The 135 had to go full throttle during the refuel, that think shook so bad one would think that it was going to shake apart.  Crew chiefs were allowed to lay in the boom pod with the boomer during the refuel.  It was awesome!""WHYYYYYYYY?!....WHY YOU AL-WAYS KICK ME WHEN III'M....HIIIIIGGGGHHHHH?!""Airplane?  This shit was designed to haunt dreams.  Not carry passengers.Should out to evergreen aviation museum, it has one partially opened sr71, the spruce goose, and a myriad of other cool fighters, jet liners, and even a free tanks. Just outside Mcminnville, OregonI've always wondered what replaced the SR-71's role in the modern day air force.X-Jet?http://imgur.com/aETYDXBA few random items. All planes get metal fatigue with microscopic cracks, that over a lifetime, will eventually ground the airframe. The SR-71 was composed of titanium and heated up so much during its flights, that the plane would stretch about a foot in length and the heat would soften the metal so much that it would fill in the cracks. The airframe was basically reforged every flight. It also got more and more fuel efficient the faster it flew. The only limitation on its top speed was the engine cones would melt after Mach 3.7 or so. The A-12 flew slightly higher and slightly faster because it was lighter with only having 1 person on board and 1 bay for reconnaissance as opposed to the SR-71's 3 bays for reconnaissance.

Also, Wright Patterson is the world's oldest and largest aviation museum. They are moving the presidential and experimental planes to the main campus next spring so you will no longer have to take a shuttle bus or miss those exhibits if and when you visit.You might like [this](http://www.nmusafvirtualtour.com/media/068/SR-71A%20Front%20Cockpit.html) a 3d view of the cockpit.

Also, find a copy of Sled Driver on pdf by Brian Schul. Well worth the read.""The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. An advanced long range strategic reconnaissance aircraft capable of mach 3 and an altitude of 85,000 feet.""

""You sure do know a lot about it..""

""DO YOU EVEN READ MY CHRISTMAS LIST?""Go to RAF Duxford, you can reach over ropes and touch one. If anyone is interested in learning more about the SR-71 and a couple of very Top Secret aircraft, at the time, I would suggest reading the book *Skunk Works* it is a great read.


Fun fact, every second that this plane was flying at Mach 3 the engines took in the same amount of air as 2 *million* people breathing in at the same time.From **Sled Driver: Flying The World's Fastest Jet** - There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""

Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""

And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""

I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""

It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

Like even now with our tiny planet we can't get along and when you compare some countries and their views with one another they can be total opposites. Like just 2,000 miles from me, or a 5 hour flight, are countries where women can't vote or are allowed to do basic things, or places where young children have to work all day for a couple of dollars whereas mine can just go to school and then come home and watch Netflix. If that 2,000 was suddenly 200,000 who knows how different different areas of the planet could be. There could be a war 5x the scale of WW2 going on in one area on the planet and then on another area they could be oblivious to it.

- Peacock, probablywhen i was growing up my neighbours had a massive iguana (7 foot long), it was basically a vegetarian alligator. 

He was actually really chill, loved to sit on the back of their couch and sun himself.. until one day in February when I walked into their house wearing my favorite red toque with a huge pom-pom on top.. now King (yea.. they called it King) decided the big red head was a serious threat and needed to be promptly dealt with. From his usual position on the back of the couch he was right at the door and at just the right height to bat me in the head with his tail (that probably made up 4 of his 7 feet and was at least 2 inches across at the base). 

Fucker knocked me out cold.. I woke up to the parents leaning over me and freaking out / appologizing, saying he'd never done anything like that before etc. etc... I was fine.. but I still don't like lizards..

I work as a mail carrier, and today I saw this HUGE turtle in the road, on a fairly busy road actually. So I put my mail in my bag and go to rescue him, all of the cars were changing lanes to avoid him (it was a two lane one way). I go in to grab him, and this white car comes up and isn't paying attention. He's texting and he doesn't change lanes.

I was one foot away from my turtle friend when he hits him going 45. Ruining my big little friend. He didn't die, but his body was torn in half and his shell was crushed. He lifted his head in agony and my heart broke. I'm a 25 year old man and I cried while I stood there. I couldn't save my friend from his fate.

Another car comes down within a minute or two and finishes him off. This time I was relieved he was no longer in pain.

I've seen it all, but today was a especially bad day.Definitely post that here too: https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyanimalsonfingersI LIKE ^^^TUTTLESThere were two at my work a while back!

Cus it get cold like Minnesota.It's a lovely picture, but a little editing would really help bring it out.  Some noise reduction, especially in the shadows, would help clean up the tones and a little bump in contrast and clarity would help it pop.

[I gave it a little play in photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/YWPZVHE.jpg) - mainly what I said and also straightening the lines up a little.    There wasn't a whole lot I could do with the low-res JPEG.  

Editing is a very important part of the photographic process.  Getting the image as correct as possible in camera is great, but editing is almost always needed to tidy it up.  

Another little tip, is that print you've had done on canvas?  Get it printed on good quality semi-gloss paper and framed (even a really cheap, basic frame) and it'll do the image the justice it deserves.  You could probably get it printed on decent paper for $10-15, and a frame like [this](http://www.therange.co.uk/fashion-black-box-frame//the-range/fcp-product/51577) - with the photo either window-mounted or at least with a white border between the image and frame.

[This blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/) explains the whole story. 

Today (by co-incidence) there was a [follow-up post](http://digileaders.com/ok-think-loud-organisational-culture/) with some other thoughts.

To answer a few of the questions I've seen in the thread:

* I work at the UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) and yes, we are hiring
* yes this is real
* no, there was no input from Human Resources or from senior management
* we did it because we work in an organisation where doing things like this is ok
* it's not aspirational; this is a list of things newcomers need to know about how things already are
* yes that's our office building in central London, but we share the building with other organisations so it's not all ours
* the poster mentions Slack because Slack is one of the tools we use to get stuff done; we use many other tools too :)
* as others have pointed out, there's a print-your-own PDF linked from [the original blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/), so if you'd like to put a copy up on your wall, you can

> stay home when you feel ill

I wish more people did this. I work in a large building with a lot of employees. They'll cough, sniffle, sneeze, wipe their nose and just generally leak. 

It's gross, and you're not a 'trooper"" for working when you're sick, you're putting me at risk of catching whatever nasty-ass shit you've caught.

Stay home and rest - don't make the rest of us have what you have.

EDIT: of course this only applies to companies that give you sick time![Picture of the boss.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yHJVlf-SLgg/UjSxTIsZR6I/AAAAAAAAAPs/DbeAaLDZ18k/s1600/office-space-lazy-mode.png)This would only encourage me to work harder and be more loyal to the company. No, it's bloody well not okay to sing at work. Not everyone has a pleasant voice. This only works with people who *want* to work. The kind of people who want their work to always be top notch because they feel it's a reflection of them as a person. If you happen to find the rare office full of these people, then these kinds of policies provide the necessary freedom for the job to get done the most efficiently and at the highest quality.

In the countless offices and jobs where people are just there to collect a check, this absolutely does not work. And I'm not necessarily always blaming the employees. Some jobs are just shit and no one would ever *want* to work it. It just is what it is sometimes.Plot twist: This is an ad for Slack.Where I work the list would fit on a sticky note.

It's ok to......work, because that's what I'm paying you for. Now get back to work and stop wasting my money reading notes on the wall.Employees can be treated like people? I didn't know that was an option.I like the ""not check your email out of hours"" bit.

Nothing pisses me off more than getting hounded for not responding to emails, when I haven't had a chance to check them.

*walk into office*

""Hey, you never responded to my email.""

""When did you send it?""

""Last night, at around 7pm.""

""....correct, I didn't respond. I wasn't working at that time.""

*fast forward when someone complains about it*

""Part of your job expectation is that you check your email and respond promptly.""

""Okay, then show me that clause in my contract. Because I'm pretty sure my contract states that I'm supposed to do my job well, as instructed, and on time. Now if you want to add a 'must check email every few hours' clause to that contract, by all means, go for it; but, it better be accompanied by a higher wage.""

&nbsp;

Aaaaaaaand, while I'm on this rant:

""Hey, I'm still waiting on a response to that email I sent you.""

""You mean the email asking me <insert random question>?""

""Yes""

""Well, we had a one-on-one meeting about it. And *then,* the next day, you asked me about it in person again. I considered the question to be answered (twice) at that point. So no, I did not respond to the email (outside of work hours), because I considered it to be a waste of my time.""

""Well, I need written confirmation from you.""

""That's absolutely understandable, but if that's the case, DON'T FUCKING ASK ME ABOUT IT - *TWICE* - IN PERSON. Or at least have the forethought to say: ""hey, I know we already talked about this, but I'd just like written confirmation."" That's a little better - BIT EVEN SO: if you really need the written confirmation, then don't bother with the in-person questions. Send an email. Ask questions. Get answers. Boom - written confirmation, and we've both only had to address this issue one time. That means that we're not getting paid to waste time, and I'm not slowly hating you for asking the same question multiple times.

&nbsp;

Sorry guys - I could go on and on and on about this. Apparently I ""have a reputation for not responding to emails,"" and it just blows my mind. No one at my office seems to agree with my rules, which are as follows:

1) If you send an email during off-hours, expect a response during on-hours. 

2) If it is urgent, and cannot wait, call me. Even if it's to say ""hey, I know it's 8pm on a Saturday, but there's a serious situation that needs addressing. Are you available to check your email?""

3) If you ask me a question in person, do not ask me the same question in an email, unless you at least acknowledge that it is a follow up, and you just need confirmation.

Work hours are work hours. Off hours are off hours. I'm perfectly willing to spend some off-hours working from time to time, as it's something we all have to do now and then; however, do not expect me to be glued to my email, as if I have nothing better to do than to work for you while not getting paid.

&nbsp;

FUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKK

&nbsp; 

EDIT: Whoa! I don't know if this qualifies as ""RIP inbox,"" but I surely did not expect this many replies! A couple of responses that may put things into context:

&nbsp;

1) This is not a salaried position. I freelance (to an extent), so these are part-time office hours at this company. I *absolutely* agree that, if I were salaried here, then I should be less hostile about unnecessary emails, and way more appreciative of that fact that I'm pulling in a decent annual, completely stable and reliable income. 

2) Although I *do* believe in everything I said, and stand by it, I'm not really this hostile at the workplace. In comes Reddit, where I can enjoy writing up a fiery rant - the type that I would never actually display at the office (although I have made these opinions known, diplomatically)

3) Given that I really provided no information as to what I do, where I do it, or what my office situation is like, I totally sympathize with those of you who think I just hate my job, suck at it, don't put in any extra effort, and won't ""climb the ladder,"" (so to speak); however, it's probably worth noting that I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisors and coworkers, and though I have this reputation about emails, I also have a reputation for doing far more work than is required (and happily so, because I *do* believe in the company and its overall goals), as well as a reputation of going out of my way to help guide other workers in how to do their jobs more effectively. I love my job, but it is a small company, and because I believe in it, it sometimes feels like a full time gig - without the benefits. Perhaps that is why I get a little snarky about off-hours emails.

4) Lastly, the head of the company has almost always taken my side in this issue, and has complained to managers about sending six emails that could be consolidated into one, as well as trying to limit emails to office hours (when it's not an emergency). This was meant to be more of a Lewis Black style ""let me rant about this small thing!,"" rather than a ""my company is absolute shit for doing this to me."" (That being said, again, I stand by my reactions!)

&nbsp;

SECOND EDIT: and my gold cherry has been popped, it would seem. Obligatory thanks, kind strangerSeeing this makes me feel happy knowing that there are good employers out there, and simultaneously sad that I work in an exploitative hell-hole where most of the things on this list are *not* ok.Lots of people asking where this is, are they hiring, or saying it's made up...

It's from the team at the UK's Government Digital Service. 

https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/Judging by the comments here, inclusive workplaces aren't as common as I thought.  This is just basic respect for your employees, I'm bummed a lot of people think this is a weird idea.


Edit:  To clarify, I'm bummed that people are forced to work at places that reward presenteeism and conformity, as I was naiively under the impression that more workplaces understood that those aren't the best ways to get optimal results from your employees.  I wasn't saying that you're all fascists or a part of a major problem if this way of working is new to you.  There used to be a course on EdX by Catalyst about this kind of thing that is probably still available for audit if anyone is interested.Are they hiring?Irony - most people are reading this on Reddit at work.That looks like a cool building!The only explanation. They grow marijuana. Well this makes me sad about my job even more. Serious question. Am I the only one who wonders if I'm lazy, or just want more from my job than just a paycheck? Or am I alone in this one?file under: notes i'll never see at my jobit's ok to....

[It looked like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Comptometer_model_E.png), but the copper body was pretty heavily tarnished and almost black like a really old worn penny.

It was incredibly impressive to see how such a complex device was put together (and very satisfying to be able to take it apart and put it back together without screwing it up!). I took photos of the inside, which I don't have access to right now, but [here's an internet pic of the inside with the shell taken off](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/08/comptometer_interior.jpg).

Colima is like that.  It's rather young (about 5 million years), rather tall (12,595 feet with a 2,000 foot prominence), and highly active (more than 40 eruptions in the last 500 years).  So it's not that difficult to end up getting awesome pictures of it.

[Or this](http://i.imgur.com/szdpRIN.jpg)

It's also a Decade Volcano, one of 16 in the world that are given extra research and study due to their activity levels, destructive eruptions, and proximity to population centers.  There have been five eruptions at Colima in the last 18 months.How do you take an 8 second exposure but not have lots of blur from the moving smoke and possible vibrations in the ground?r/EarthPornDo you want to become my desktop background? Because that's how you become my desktop background. That backdrop is really what makes this photo shine. Just the stars in the background seem to really help this excellent shot pop out.It still feels entirely unfair to me that volcanos can *also* produce lightning. Like, what can't they accomplish? They create land. They create atmosphere. They royally fuck shit up under the right/wrong circumstances, depending on your point of view.

For the record, not everybody wants to spend $30k on a stuffy, uptight cathedral wedding where everyone has to wear satin and look like they have a corn cob shoved in their asshole. Some people just want to marry the person they love with their closest friends and family around without having to stress about details.

This guy knows all about your little tricks! I love telling groups of hipsters to relax and then photograph them in their natural state.  Wow some people can be so judgy and spiteful on here. Let them do any style they want, maybe they know the faux-rockabilly  hipster pinterest stuff is tired .. but so is most anything tied into a wedding. Relax you cynical people and someone might want to marry you someday. occasional wedding photographer here: my favorite trick is to tell whoever I'm shooting that I just need to get a ""few test shots"" and then we can get started. or I've already started shooting, I can pull the whole, ""hold on just gotta load another memory card!"" my camera holds two cards so I can keep shooting even with one removed. usually these are some of the most relaxed and natural looking pics from the whole affair. I agree. Natural photos always look so much better. Maybe that's just because we normally don't see people ""trying"" to look a certain way for a picture and we just see them how they normally are. Or, I think, that people make themselves look worse than they really are by trying to look a certain fake way that they don't normally look.

>Here's the background story; late one night, after a few beers, I painted [this](http://i.imgur.com/NUQl7.jpg) in the local dog park. My friend snuck an article about it into a local newspaper. Someone who works for Chorus (the company that owns these utility boxes) saw the article, and got in touch with me (they had been [commissioning artists](https://www.chorus.co.nz/cabinet-art) to decorate these DSL cabinets for a few years already). 

>I get paid a small fee for each one - enough to cover time and materials. I used Internet memes as the inspiration for a lot of them, because they are our physical Internet connections - chances are images like AstroSloth and Awkward Seal, etc, had already been transmitted through these boxes before I painted them.

My uncle was in hospital for a long time, and it was striking that the hospital in Scotland would spend so much money on fancy equipment, and nothing on small things which would improve the stay one-hundred fold.

An example: they had high-tech beds with televisions, and telephones, but they didn't have an engineering contract to service them, so noone could use them. My uncle was an engineer and planned to donate his services when he got out, but he never did. This is fantastic. I have always wanted to have this done at our nonprofit but never knew how to go about it. One day I will figure it out. Thank you for donating your time and doing this to help bring people a smile.

Some of his newer stuff is corny, I like the object stuff and see through skulls betterWow, shut up and take our money already. Really cool stuff! Look forward to seeing more as your advance and perfect your craft.This is great! The questions I think of while perusing your instagram:

- Can you control the thickness of the layer to a great degree?

- Does the hardened resin let you ""scrap off"" paint that you've laid down?  Either fresh or after it's dried? I've worked a bit with oil but I'm not sure how acrylic behaves exactly or how dense and hard the resin is for scraping.

- Please try [this!](http://i.imgur.com/M40mAQ0.gif) These stereographic images are easy as pie to make.  Just take two pictures of the same focal point on the piece, but a couple of millimetres apart (more or less, experiment a bit perhaps).  Combine them in a gif format to play for a fraction of a second back and forth, and it will appear 3d to the viewer :).

As /u/and_what_army said then:

> This family has already been through hell. A child with seizures is hard enough, but by the time they go on a Keto diet it usually means traditional treatments have been exhausted and all the normal medicines (Banzel, Klonopin, Depakote, Diastat, Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, and probably others) don't work. Keto as a medical treatment is much harder than Keto for weight control. Fletcher probably had to go into the hospital for 2-3 days while he adjusted to being on the diet, and now everything that passes his lips must be weighed to the 1/10th gram. He probably can't even wear the wrong kind of sunscreen, because anything on the skin could affect the body chemistry for the Keto diet.I ordered a bag of glow-in-the-dark toys for kids who want them or who can't take candies. I also printed signs that read, ""**Toys available for kids with allergies. Shots available for adults with kids.**""

I spent more on Jameson and little plastic glasses than toys and candies, but it's probably a decent investment to build some goodwill for my first Halloween in the neighborhood.

Edit: Thank you, anonyperson, for the Gold. It's a real treat.My son does not have medical restrictions on his diet.

Nonetheless, I eat his candy.

Because I am a responsible parent who goes the extra mile.Here's what I do as a crazy irresponsible parent with a kid who is actually severely allergic to peanuts (I say actually because many people claim to be who aren't, seriously).  We go trick or treating and do not burden our neighbors with anything.  Fill up the bag with whatever!  Then when we get home we break out the safe treat bag and start the trading.  He couldn't care less because he doesn't know what he's missing and loves red-vines, skittles etc.  We can usually redistribute most of the unsafe candy back out to the remaining trick or treaters, and what is still left over goes to work with me (although it might not all make it further than my desk).

First lesson with allergies; it's on you to manage it.  I've had people actually say to him ""no it doesn't have peanuts in it, just peanut butter.""  He learned how to read ingredients at 5 and he's managed it pretty well.I had a step child with PKU and a child with other unrelated food allergies. Our solution was to let them go hog wild on Halloween and get as much candy as they could. I would then pay them $1/pound for the candy and we would go and buy a toy the following weekend. I'd take the candy to work and then I didn't have to worry about the kids sneaking candy they shouldn't have, they got to experience Halloween the same way as all the other kids, and they got a new toy. It seemed to work pretty well. Just a thought for parents who would like their kids to have the experience but don't have the time to send out nice fliers with attached toys.Plot development: One of the receiver of the letter bought an angry bird costume and introduced himself as Fletcher on halloweenThis is the kind of thing my cousins family would do. Ever since he was an infant he's been deathly allergic to a long list of things (walking past a boiling pot of wheat-based pasta once triggered an asthma attack from the vapour). 

The family didn't turn the house into a bubble, they didn't ban anything coming into the home. They just made a little sign on the door informing people that someone with severe allergies lives there and to please follow some basic steps to avoid any issues (they'd always mention it to a first-time visitor though). Simple things like ""Please wash your hands after eating or handling any food products"", having a cupboard strictly for his dishes and food, no perfume. 

*He* was taught to watch for things, wash his hands religiously, and to bring his own stuff (like popcorn to theatres, letting the staff know of the allergies), not to rely on other people who probably have no clue. He's nearly 20 now and still very much alive.

In many ways it's comparable to a disability. Yes society adapts to a point but it's really up to individuals to learn how to live with it.

(Edits for clarity...and spelling)Active vs. Passive parenting. Not trying to bash the other post, but *this* is how to properly handle your child's allergies/diet on Halloween.This doesn't belong to me, but the 'responsible' parent who posted about her kids peanut allergy pissed me off and reminded me of this awesome parent. 

EDIT: Wow this really blew up! jumped 50 upvotes in 1 refresh! 

EDIT: Front page! thanks

EDIT: GOLD! Thanks!This could just be an elaborate ruse to find out ahead of time which houses to skip over in order to maximize the Halloween haul. 

My record is 5 1/2 large pillow cases loaded with candy within the 2 hour window, but this type of info could really help me out. After all, I turned 37 this year, and my legs aren't quite what they used to be.How irresponsible to name your child ""Fletcher.""With all the weirdos, allergies, and special diets out there these days, it's really a wonder that trick or treating even exists anymore. I have epilepsy and had to go through this same ordeal. However, instead of parents handing out toys, my parents just said I was too old to trick or treat. 

... I was 6. Lame...A real parent would sue all the candy manufacturers and each household that gave him candy.

We mused on the idea of filling our apartment with foam, and then all sitting and studying in the waist high foam. So when the landlord came and said ""No foam parties!"" We'd all act really mad and say ""Excuse me does this look like a party? We all have exams tomorrow could you please leave?""
Fucking kids these days. When I was a kid I *knew* how to get in troubleI threw a Halloween party at my house in college once, 300some people showed up (we had a big house and a big fenced in yard)  It was wild, DJs, bouncers, girls dancing on the bar, 3 floors of madness.  It was awesome.

Well at about 2am the cops showed up in full force expecting to have to chase down tons of underage drinkers and drug users.  Thankfully we prepared.  When the cops showed up we had the 2 ""bouncers"" greet them and texted us that it was time to break up the time. 

I got on the DJ's mic and told everyone that the cops were here and wanted the party to end, but they didn't want trouble.  So I urged everyone to NOT run, as it creates a panicky atmosphere where cops and students are freaking out.  

All the students left, no arrest or citations, and even though I was underage, the cops left us with a verbal warning.  The head officer then came to me, shook my hand, and said great party and thanks for ending it so calmly.

We got to party like animals for 5 hours and it had 0 negative outcomes.


*TL'DR - cops like a good party as much as the next guy, and thanked us for ending it when they asked in a responsible manner*I love being Canadian.Why couldn't they just let them turn down their music? This is actually amazing.In high school my friends and I threw a graduation party with no alcohol. All the partiers were either in some music department or taking AP classes and headed to college next fall. 

We had the cops come into the backyard because of noise complaints/possible drinking/typical suburban problems. The first conversation they heard was about Cello and what it takes to play at a collegiate level between me and my friend. 

Literally the words the cops said to us were, ""oh we can see you kids are  having fun, try to keep it down your neighbors are worried."" 

That was a fun summer. memories. [Expectation](http://i.imgur.com/DyO8lrw.jpg)

Like, throw another party, have the music bumping loud enough for the neighbors to get bothered by the bass, and get the cops called again.

I mean it has very nice seating, but that is about it.

The tv and the projector screen are rather small, there are skylights and these strange candles in the front. It might be some sort of stage or chapel or something.

It's was like a before and after infomercial where they have terrible lighting on the beforeEven this picture is giving a false impression, albeit the opposite one in so far as it tries to make him look older in the before picture. The picture of him when he was younger has him smiling widely which of course creates wrinkles and lines as the muscles of his face contract. This lessons the impact of any permanent lines on his older picture. 
  
TL;DR A better comparison would have the same facial expression in both and no wide smiles. TIL people ageHe was greying a bit in the first, and then 8 years later he is even more grey. Hmmmmm. How the hell?Wasn't your mole on the other side...?

I see this every day when I look in the mirror and there is no longer a young healthy 21 year old looking back at me.  I'm 54 now.  When I was 21 I was immortal.  At 54 I can now sense that I am not.  Unrelenting and irrevocable.  Time sucks.I went to school here! That building just past the road on the left.
It's not all bad though, the area is being regenerated and there's new housing and a new school now.It's a great shame to see communities like this lost from towns and cities across England but unfortunately it's a result of the times we live in. 

I live in Liverpool City centre and a comparison of the city centre 39 years ago and how it is today would produce an equally surprising yet positive contrasting image. The city Centre is amazing and is a credit to the hard work done by Liverpool City council.

More mind-blowing glass at /r/glassheadsBut people wouldn't believe you if you told them that it's actually part of a bigger loaf unless you show them a photo of it. They'll just think it's some lame souvenir shop pendant.I can't even comprehend how the artist was able to do this so perfectly. Really cool piece of art.[deleted]SO DARK THE CON OF MAN

Edit: And if you want to compare the glasswork to the original:

http://i.imgur.com/SHUEeBq.jpg""each slice sold for $5000? Jesus, it's just glass! Slap an art tag on a pile of shit and I could sell it I bet!""

*opens link*

""oh.. Yeah, 5k sounds fair.""Every time I read a description about an art form I always think- ""cool something for me to try""
I have to pretend I never saw this nowProfessional glass artist here. This is how it's made:

The artist will pull very long strands of glass in all the colors that required for the picture he wants to make. They then arrange the long strands of glass into say a face or a foot or something. then melt them all together and pull that very long again. Then you can take the face you made and add that 'face' strand to a whole bunch of other strands to make an overall picture.

tldr: it's just like using one pixel at a time to make up the whole image.[deleted]Yeah yeah yeah that's real neat and all but you can't even smoke weed out of it.  Fantastic stuff! I love this.Cut it thinIs there a discount for the end piece?how do they slice this?Calling these things slices makes me want to eat one.If you're interested in glass art, there are two really good subreddits for it. /r/glassheads and /r/lampwork are both full of amazing glass art, artisits, and a copious amount of knowledgeable people in the art.In the future, the one who can collect all the pieces and join them together will be granted a wish. Glassloaf Z!When you slice the loaf, you can make a Strata-cut animation. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH42WFUNwfY) is an example.

It was big and had such strength. It pulled me straight down to the bottom of the bay, about 25-30ft. I was moving incredibly fast through the water. It whipped me back and forth five or six times.

Damn. You made the rain your bitch.Channel it to a neighbors yard? ;)Unless you live in Colorado. Nice!  Do you have more pics?That is a great idea! Now do mine.Cool! Where in California is this again?Nice mosquito trench.It looks a bit like a rain garden. The function of a rain garden is to increase infiltration rates and prevent runoff. They can also act to filter out pollutants. It's hard to tell by this angle but it looks like the intent is not to just run water from the downspouts to the pavement. 

Overall I like it. It probably helps reduce runoff and increase water infiltration. We should all build these in our yards to improve the water quality of our streams and rivers. Could use more deep rooted plants in it to make it better. 

Also as a side note, the city I live in will reimburse half the costs of a rain garden up to a certain amount. I bet many other towns do the same and few people know it. This looks awesome and yes it is the oldest method of irrigation! Am I the only person that thinks the pipe looks like an upside down bendy straw?Y'all have them cool porches I like.

I took this one and fed her puppy formula every few hours for two days; took her to work with me, kept her in a cooler full of my shirts in the shade.  Day three her eyes looked great and she was active so I did some homework and found a local vet who rehabilitates squirrels and skunks and [shipped her off to rehab](http://i.imgur.com/Xn9KawT.jpg).   I was sad to see her go but I can't be raising no skunk.

Little stinker Looks like a Tribble.Animal control officer here.

Skunks, at least here in my part of Texas, are the number one carrier of rabies. As many as 2/3rds of skunks tested return positive results. It's not likely the baby has it, but it is possible. It's spread through the saliva and mother animals tend to clean their young with their tongues so while unlikely, it CAN be spread without requiring a bite or scratch.

The virus likely wouldn't survive long on the baby's fur but I'd still exercise caution. Wash your hands thoroughly. Don't rub your eyes or pick your nose. This is assuming you made sure you had no open cuts on your hand before handling it.

Baby skunks are kind of case-by-case when it comes to spraying. Some of them won't do it at all while others will lift their tails and spin around like a garden sprinkler. Approached carefully, most skunks won't even spray.

If you notify your local animal control agency, just a heads up, they'll very possibly treat this as an exposure and, for your own safety, euthanize the skunk and submit it to be tested for rabies.

What was the advantage to this style of building?I'm so confused right now. I don't know if the whole thing is flat and jut painted (including the brick columns and the illusion of the blanket as if it was over the facade), if the brick columns are real, if there is indeed a flat cardboard only everything on it (the nails and everything) is just painted, or if they actually peeled off the brick layer and this came out. Damn you talented artists, you have made me doubt reality again. wow that is some of the best Trompe-l'œil I've ever seen and on that sort of scale too.

My mom used to try to paint certain things in the same style and it looked good but never to that extentThis is gorgeous. The gooderham building! interestingly it has a triangular shape and is older then the Flatiron in New YorkI've been telling my wife that we should go to Toronto...

[Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about.

One of the husbands friends buys a bottle of booze of the same year the first baby was born, but cannot drink it. The father has to wait until the kid is old enough to drink or is finally mature.

It will be reposted to facebook next week and my mom will show it to me next month. Can anyone figure out how he got in that position? Perpendicular to two parallel semis? As a former firefighter I have seen people live through much worse. I don't have pictures to prove it but it is weird how some people can survive crazy shit. The majority of them where not in great shape but they did live.

The one that I remember most though is a drunk that hit a mini-van head on. This was back in 1989 and the guys head punched through the windshield. The Sgt. went to support his neck and his fingers slid inside his throat. Took us all back for a few seconds and then we went back to the rescue.

Once we removed the dash both of his legs where facing towards his torso and through all this, he was breathing. Not with it, but alive.

He survived though.Like a good neighbor, state farm is therrreee..... with a hacksawhttp://i.imgur.com/ds7nimr.gifvDoes anyone else find it unsettling that there is a skull like face embedded into the crumpled frame just to the right of his face?!So this is actually my cousin, just got off the phone with him. He was coming back from a business trip in Oregon (he's a farmer in Washington) when this happened. According to him there semis in front of him hit black ice, and he then slid into them, crushing him like this. His airbag didn't go off (luckily) and he said he had about 1 ft. of room to move around in. He was able to get out of the car after about 30 minutes. Although he says he only has a couple cuts and a bruise near his eye, he did go to the hospital where he was checked out and everything was fine. He's now happy to be home with his son and pregnant wife.

Cherry blossoms guide your way,

It's snowing on Mount Fuji. http://i.minus.com/iblgBgXYNzj0gs.gifhow come the pictures look so soft?Dumbass coming through. What's with all the ""it's snowing on Mt. Fuji"" comments?I read this as ""Japan in full boom""
I expected something else[Source](https://500px.com/photo/105244145/fuji!-by-daniel-kordan) and /r/japanpics if you want to take a look.For anyone feeling inspired to go to Japan, I've gone twice so let me make it concrete for ya.

**Flights:** Flights can be, at best, around 600 USD round trip. United ran a special for this cost. Often you'll find a round trip for about 1200 USD (this is my experience flying from SFO in the bay area). Use [itasoftware](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) to search for flights. Also google around for deals.

Alternatively, look into acquiring mileage points through credit card usage and flying for free. 

**Room:** On my second visit I stayed in a hostel called [Khaosan Kabuki](http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/en/kabuki/) for about 35 a night. You can get free room if you volunteer to clean. 

Many hostels are similarly priced / have similar volunteer benefits. 

Let me clarify that a ""hostel"" is not as shady as it connotes. The place I stayed was as clean as any hotel I've been to.

Capsule Hotels are also cheap and somewhat of an experience. 

**Food:** Food in Japan is like food anywhere. There's cheap stuff (less than 10) decent stuff (10-25) and expensive (30-100's). 

You can have a very enjoyable trip eating for less than 10 a meal although I suggest splurging once or twice because Japan does have amazing food to offer. The best value / quality for sushi I've heard of and had myself is a place called [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/index.html).

There's no tipping either which is amazing as I'm from the U.S. and any $10 meal was actually $10.

**Sights / Activities:** This is far more flexible depending on the kind of person you are. I spent most of my time walking around which is free.  I recommend at least 1 planned activity that's unique to Japan and new to you (Karaoke, Onsen, traditional breakfast, etc). 

**Language Barrier:** Japanese people are some of the most courteous and kind people in the world. Culture reasons. One of the things that stands out on my first trip was a mob of people *standing on the right side of an escalator and letting walkers through on the left. No one broke this rule.* 

English is pretty prevalent in Japan, especially the cities. In fact there's a Starbucks in the Shibuya Crossing which is a hugely popular spot and a KFC nearby. Western influence abounds.

People are mostly happy to try and communicate with you. But yes, it's scary to engage with someone who doesn't speak your language. 

**Story Time:** I was with my friend Matt (who had actually just finished traveling east from Florida... long way around the world). We had a ""sushi day"" where we decided to get expensive sushi lunch and dinner in the same day.

For lunch, we visited [Kyubei](http://www.kyubey.jp/). Our reservation was made by our Hostel staff (which is something they are always willing to help with). I'm assuming they acknowledged we were English speaking and we were sat with a chef who spoke enough English. 

For dinner, we visited the [highest-rated sushi place on Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066854-d1692134-Reviews-Sushiryori_Inose-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html). After an awesome sushi course, we were sitting alone in their shop. It was cold outside. The sushi chef spoke ""O-sake?"" offering us some sake. 

Well, we ended up sitting with them for almost two more hours drinking sake and bumbling our way through communication. I learned their son is a model in magazines. They pulled out a giant map of the world and my friend Matt showed them where he had been. They like California Cabernet wine. The wife played some Michael Jackson on her phone and did an impersonation. 

Points here are that people want to connect with you and Japan is pretty accepting of English.

We even had a bus driver yelling at us on a bus full of Japanese passengers. Turns out we missed our stop (I had mentioned it to him before getting on). He literally stopped the bus, motioned for us to get out, and pointed us in the right direction. It was embarrassing and stressful unlike the previous sushi dinners. Point here is that there will be moments where it's not roses.

All in all you could do Japan on 2k easily. If you pull a flight deal or a free flight through miles it'll be even cheaper.Ok, I will be that guy.

WTF is going on with the ladder. 

It looks like somebody was fixing the roof and just said. ""Fuck it, I will just leave this here.""Where was this taken?  gTA needs a game set in Japan.I miss japan. Dey are all perfect.It is snowing on Mt FujiSee, this is what /r/pics should be about!This is a gorgeous picture.  The only times I've visited locations like this have been in video games, and I always love it.  that looks badassAnd I thought our cherry blossoms looked nice (I'm in DC)Gorgeous!
