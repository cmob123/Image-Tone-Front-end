He died protecting priceless antiquities from destruction, something he definitely believed in.  Sad for him to die but certainly honorable for him to die with his convictions.The man was 82 years old and brave as fuck. RIP.This is so heartbreaking. His love for the Palmyra Antiquities surpassed his love for his own life.

I hope that wherever he goes, he's rolling in antiquities and unbelievable treasures.  Here's a story. 

The New York Times: ISIS Beheads Syrian Antiquities Scholar. http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw5JqtgyU...why can't the entire world be more successful against ISIS... the news about them is always so frustrating and infuriatingIt breaks my heart so much history is being destroyed. Especially since that area (Iraq, Iran, etc) is literally like the cradle of civilization and there's SO MUCH priceless stuff there. It's truly a terrible thing.When you feel threatened by ancient monuments, dead gods and archeologists, you're in the wrong and so is your ideology.[This is Tomislav Salopek, 31, father of two, Croatian] (http://static.klix.ba/media/images/vijesti/b_150813104.jpg), beheaded by ISIS a week ago, because, well, ISIS likes to behead peopleRIP Khaled Assad. You died a more honorable man than those who killed you. Thank you khaled. You're a hero to history.Most news stories failed to say why he was murdered. The man was a hero who sacrificed himself to protect his lifetime of work. 

It's long passed time for the surrounding Muslim countries, who have millions of soldiers in their armies, to come together and put an end to these monsters once and for all.  I know Isis are shitheads but why do they destroy ancient buildings and antiques?R.I.P. man of ethics and morality.Perhaps some of the powerful sovereigns in regions **SHOULD STEP THE FUCK UP** and save their culture and history before it's wiped out by these assholes.


It's hard for me to be upset about this anymore.

I'm absolutely shocked at the loss of priceless history and the barbarism to kill this man over this, but if no one in the Middle East wants to stop ISIS, then I say the West should pull out, and let them have their cake.

There's no way we, with a foreign modern military, can go into a region like the Middle East and solve these problems by killing people.

Our foreign military can support and assist in a force led by a local sovereign, but we cannot lead a war over there and come out the winner, nor accomplish anything effective.

People have the right to self determination. If those people in the territory now controlled by ISIS, and those sovereigns around them want to allow ISIS sovereign control, so be it.**NEW GAME:** No more need to hunt and kill secondary game like lions and rhinos.  It's time to drop all of the poachers into ISIS territory armed to the teeth and wearing GoPros with instructions to bring back their heads as trophies.  Poach for your life baby!Fuck You ISIS!Wow.

RIP.As a historian I am really feeling that it is time for us to organize and begin seriously defending these sites. This man died with honor. I hope he finds peace. Will somebody plz take out those piece of shit fucktards? I hope if I ever face my own death like that I can have half the balls this guy did and tell them fuck right off. This guy is a hero and died as honorable a death as any man could hope for, die protecting and defending what you love and lived for.I was talking with a lot of redditors yesterday trying to understand how ISIS is able to recruit and hold so much control if seemingly no one supports them. 

The common answer from Muslims was that ""more Muslims support ISIS than are willing to admit it publicly"".  And that ""even if they don't actively support them, they tacitly support them by secretly agreeing with their actions"". 

That was concerning to me, and as much as I hate to agree with GW Bush, I can kind of start to see the logic of his ""If you aren't with us, you're against us"" comment. 

Seeing people like this man, get beheaded for such a noble cause kind of highlights for me how terribly evil this group is.  If you even *remotely* support what these people are doing, fuck you. 

This truly is a point in time where everyone needs to clearly pick a side. This is the kind of shit that we as a society can't tolerate. I guess real life is not like a movie. I wonder if he spent his last seconds wondering if someone would come to save him. I hate when good people have to die like this. fucking savages

RIP, real manAlpha as Fuck. ISIS - Tell us where you have the shit hid. Kahled - Fuck You.

I have similar windows right next to my desk, every day a female cardinal lands on the window sill and looks at herself for several minutes, sometimes pecking at her image.  Usually the male eventually sees her and starts singing at her until she turns and they fly off.   I always imagine him yelling ""C'mon, you look fine!, We have to go, we're going to be late!""
We never got deer, but we definitely got a lot of people stopping to fix their hair, a few fixing makeup and one muscly asian guy who danced while staring at himself for about five minutes.

Probably the best and cruelest use of it was gluing a coin to the pavement.They suck when geese or swans nest by them, the dumb things see their reflections and think that it's a rival, and peck at the windows.

We have the same windows around the building I work at. A deer charged at the glass and broke through. Spent the next few hours running around the building spewing blood on everything.I used to think that too until we had an aggressive seagull trying to fight his reflection in our window.  He would peck his reflection for hours and hours every day for weeks.My grandparents used to have a house in Tucson with one-way windows. Every morning we would wake up to a family of quails banging their heads against the window, I assume to beat up the other, identical family of quails who were invading their turf.

Quails are not so smart.[deleted]I worked in my university's print shop full-time, sweet deal, free tuition and they let me leave for three hours each day, with pay, to attend one class plus I was on campus for the evening class as well.  Anyway, our print shop was mostly underground but had these windows where you could look up to the sidewalk.  There was a railing just above and a lot of students would lean on the railing.  I had six student aides working for me and Jesus Christ did they ever stare up the skirts through that window all damn day.  I never did because I'm just not that type of guy.  I ended up taping cardboard over the windows between semesters so the next batch of aides didn't know any better, but sure enough those guys had already heard about the perk and tore down my cardboard.Expected two hobos fucking.  Was pleasantly surprised.Its great until someone stores their dildo against the window.That ain't no deer I ever seen. Where is this?

EDIT: First video taken down, [here is the video i was talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbvZNy7Bmw)I worry more about airborne debris than I do about a pressure wave.    My dad was a maintenance foreman at a refinery for many years.  They had just got on site when a grain elevator about 3/4 mile away exploded.  Not your normal little sheet metal silo, but a huge concrete structure on the ship channel.  They saw it go and could feel the heat on their skin.  One of dad's crew yelled ""Take cover!"" and they scuttled behind the cracking tower they were going to work on that day.  Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet.How deep does it go?So does anyone know why caused that massive explosion? Knowing my luck, i bet those tar filters i ordered from China last week were in one of those shipping containers.Only 50 people died? How many were vaporized?is there a before picture?That was the largest explosion I've seen that isn't a nuke.  I don't even think a MOAB is that big.To give you another unbelievable indication of the explosions scale, here is a ""before"" picture of the exact area affected from Google Earth.  The red circle is the now water-filled crater, the yellow is the area substantially destroyed by the blast.

http://i.imgur.com/JvmXti5.jpg

It kind of looks like the crater is filled with water --does anyone know? It's difficult to see the depth of the crater.Thank God the explosion happened in that giant craterIs that how it's going to be remembered from now on?  The Tianjin Crater.  Just level the ground around it and abandon the land or turn it into a park of something.  

I lived close by to a massive explosion that happened in Quebec.  [The McMasterville Explosion 1975](http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/faits_divers/clips/12049/).  That too made a huge crater in the ground and levelled an entire factory complex that belonged to CIL.  The remaining factory was demolished and scrapped.  [You can see for yourself the land has been abandoned to this very day.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/McMasterville,+QC/@45.5403273,-73.2314636,720m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cc9aa8c356f3055:0xadd1c7a969a383e4!6m1!1e1)  It's not a farm, the land is too saturated with chemical toxins.  It's not a dump because the toxins make it too dangerous to work in.  It's just fenced off abandoned land.    This is a [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&rem=&zm=15) to the ever-useful ""NukeMap"" website that shows the estimated crater and fireball size for a 3kT blast at the site.  

Same [test](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&fallout=1&zm=15), but with the fallout and radiation settings on.   

Edit:  Here is a third [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=0.02&lat=39.0388145&lng=117.7362823&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&casualties=1&humanitarian=1&rem=&zm=18), this time with a blast setting of 0.02kT, which I am being told is the more accurate value than the 3kT value that I grabbed from earlier in this thread.   (NukeMap uses google API, so you can switch to satellelite view and drag the point of impact around to compare.)It really does look like the aftermath of some type of nuclear fallout. Scary stuff.from Wikipedia:

>Chinese state media reported that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics,[5] a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.[3]

 

>The first to respond to the fire were unable to keep it from spreading. The Global Times reported that firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water, as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in chain more violent chemical reactions.
 
 


How can the local Fire Fighters not have a different procedure for dealing with a fire at this facility?[Interactive before and after photos](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-14/before-after-tianjin-explosions/6697396).

You should climb it though. It looks like someone needs to make a suitably sized golf ball and tee off!Is that urban infrastructure on upper right?  Looks like mud flowing through a canyon.Source?

I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. ""I'm afraid of swings"" he responds. ""Why"" his friend asks, ""did you have an accident while you were young?"" ""No!"" he exclaimed, ""I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing"". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, ""look how high I can go!"". 

Did that happen? probably not. 
Was there any point to that story? Nope!
 But did you read it? Well, only *you* can answer that question!Why am I only seeing Luigis?I always try to do this when I pass by a park.

The fucking Danish got it right with Lego, and Danishes, and they're right. Who gives a fuck?! Maybe they thought by 1981, when this set was made, that they didn't need to insert pamphlets telling parents to not be assholes. Because rthe Danish weren't assholes in 1981.

edit: you want more pictures of the box? just ask. I'll be up for a while.
  
EDIT: Okay, now I'm awake and sober, and can asses what I have done. The set isn't really that valuable, and I got it as part of a massive 390 set haul last year. I kept it for its historical value. The pieces are bagged in the perforated bags from back in the day, and they make that distinctive sound when you shake them. I love that sound. All I did was cut one of the seals to open it, and I don't regret it. This set is a time capsule and should be opened to see that booklet.

Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this. A Lego designer explains how the company survived: http://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1x6ldp/lego_franchise_infographic/cf8vdl3

Edit: You know, I'm really tired of older former Lego builders claiming Lego didn't produce pre-packaged sets with instructions in ""the good old days."" Unless your ""good old days"" were prior to 1978, those sets you sniff at, the ones that told you how to build spaceships with special parts? They were around: http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/year-1978 

Edit 2: Corrected the first link. http://i.imgur.com/afnTUMC.gifThis sucks balls. I tried to enter a Lego building competition at a local mall. I was a skinny little kid with long blonde hair. They told me that ""girls weren't allowed to enter"". I'm still emotionally damaged from that one, cos I was a Lego master.I'm a girl...and I wanted pink Legos. Why didn't they have pink Legos when I was a kid? Why is that so hard? Can anyone else make out what's written [on the back of the sheet](http://i.imgur.com/y5yLayE.png)?  

All I can make out is:

Greek student here. If anyone's interested, here's who they are. I should note, however, that the separate divisions of the muses weren't agreed upon till the end of antiquity.

In the center is Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. I'm assuming she's in the middle because they considered epic the highest poetic genre. Below her in the bottom right corner, Cleo, the muse of history. To the left, Urania, muse of astronomy. Then Polyhymnia, the muse of sacred poetry. Then Erato, muse of lyric poetry, specifically love poetry (her name is related to the word ""erotic""). Then Terpsichore, muse of dance and the chorus. Then Melpomene, muse of tragedy. Then Thalia, muse of comedy.  Then Euterpe, muse of elegiac poetry.
It looks like it was buried under white pumice from a volcanic eruption.

>The ancient city of Zeugma was originally founded as a Greek settlement by Seleucus I Nicator, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, in 300 BC. The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000 inhabitants.

http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/11/11/mosaics-revealed-at-ancient-greek-city-of-zeugma-in-turkey/I'm surprised by all the sediment/ (for the lack of a better word) stuff that ended up on top of it over the years. Although I know 2,000 years, plus or minus half a millennium, is a lot of time for the accumulation of sediment/stuff to take place, I didn't realize several feet/ meters could pile up that fast. [Touched it up a bit.](http://imgur.com/Z4SbgUO)It makes me so happy to know there are still things in the world to be discovered.I was excited when i tore up a carpet and found a hardwood floor. Now i know that was bush league.Wow, can't imagine the feeling you must get discovering this yourself. HOW CAN IT BE GREEK IF ITS IN TURKEY IM ONTO YOU LIBERALS DONT TRY TO PLAY ME I KNEW A MAPPLEASE dont let ISIS find it...

Edit: ok, folks, I'm not a novice when it comes to geography, history and current events.   I said that because ISIS is right across the border on Syria, and heaven forbid, they make their way into Turkey somehow.   We see Russians in the Ukraine so why is spillover totally impossible?  I mean no offense to Muslims in general, but ISIS has history of destroying works of art, monuments and historical sites in towns it makes a home in.   Man, reddit, you are fickle and easy to insult a total stranger.   First time I've been called a ""knuckle dragging mouth breather"".

Edit #2:  Alright, let me justify the comment/joke behind what I said.  Current (2 week old information) shows that [ISIS holds the boarder area of Turkey in Syria and the northern end of Iraq.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0).  [That's about 25 miles/40 km](http://imgur.com/E1PqDqE) to the site where that mosaic is being uncovered...Not really far.  Of course its a stretch to say ISIS will invade Turkey anytime soon.  But sheesh man, they're right there at the doorstep.  Chill out people.This will probably get buried but I work for the Biblical Archaeology Society and we did a short piece on this last week. This is from Zeugma, an ancient trading center that was the only point traders and travelers could cross the Euphrates. The name literally means ""bridge"". In the 90s turkey built a dam farther down the river and submerged 30% of the site underwater. They've been excavating since 2000 and this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. I think it's worth pointing out that these mosaics actually date to the 2nd or 3rd cent. A.D., so at a glance, they are about 1,750 to 1,850 years old, rather than 2,200, as has been reported in the media.
([Here is a good source](http://www.ccaroma.org/en/zeugma-conservation-mosaics) for more reliable info, if anyone's interested.)

There were definitely some very stunning and intricate polychrome mosaics in the Hellenistic period; it might even be considered the height of the craft.  But there are some stylistic differences that set the later mosaics apart.  That includes things like the heavy borders, the interlocking geometric patterns, the use of large(-ish) tesserae, the heavily rounded and shaded facial features, etc.
You can compare them, for example, to [these other 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics](http://followinghadrian.com/2014/10/15/roman-mosaics-from-the-national-archaeological-museum-of-spain-madrid/) from Spain.

Interestingly, it's thought that the interlocking geometric 'panel' designs in some mosaics might have been designed to imitate the elaborate panelling of the ceilings in the rooms where they were laid.

Gorgeous mosaics!  So nice to see that they've been spared the flooding that's overtaken so much of the site.

[Edit]  P.S. Also note some of the qualities I listed for 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics are common to Hellenistic mosaics, too (compare the Zeugma pavements to the [Alexander Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#mediaviewer/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) from Pompeii, for example (ca. 100 B.C.).  An art historian can probably add to this better than I can, but some of the differences are kind of ineffable to pin down.Oh man, crosspost over to /r/AncientCivilizations, they'd love this!They used sealer.awesomeIn Gaziantep, the closest major city to the archeological site, there's a state of the art ""mosaic museum"" that showcases finds from Zeugma. 

I was there a few months ago and had a blast. Southeastern Turkey is completely safe and refreshingly light on on other tourists, making you the recipient of a lot of warm hospitality from the locals.

It's just begging to be done.10 years later: ""Dad, why do I have a 4 point scar in my back?""Does bringing a child into the world automatically bestow a person with perfect balance? Seriously. I see moms/dads balancing a baby in one hand at my job, and groceries + a toddler in the other, like no big deal. I can't even carry a full cup of coffee. WHAT IS THE DEAL, PARENTS.Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. 

One daddy to another: please consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradle them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could get any sleep. 

If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. 

Also: take naps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing. Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. 

After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause both of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your wife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. 

Make sure you have infant Tylenol, baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infants, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all times* when you leave the house with the baby. 

You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. 

Keep a cloth diaper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed for work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the diaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean driveway. 

And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or professional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all just stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.

EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommending baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash cream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner ""<name of baby> has a rash on his/her ash"", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of being a daddy and you might as well get used to it now. id be scared shitless of dropping the baby, trying to catch it, forgetting i was holding a fork, and then stabbing the baby mid drop.A little bit of Velcro and you're ready for an infomercial.[deleted]My daughter used to be like this. Sleeping like a lazy leopard puts pressure on her tummy and lets the wind out. Try burping her for a bit longer after a feed, or massage her tummy, 20 circular rubs (clockwise to help digestion).

Also, I once saw a woman breastfeed both of her twins at once, whilst chowing down on a big ham sandwich. I was very impressed!I usually carry them the opposite way (because head is heavier than butt and it simply feels safer). http://imgur.com/f3Lt5I'm a Mom/Baby nurse.  The first week is definitely the worst.  Baby is programmed to eat every hour or two, mom's milk supply isn't entirely in yet, and you are so sleep-deprived you'd smack your mama in the face to get a 2-hour nap.  It will get better.  I admire your ingenuity.And people say men can't multitask!Try eating with a 32lb 1.5 year old on your left arm, and a 36 lb 3.5 year old on your right arm.  You have to depend on them to feed you properly, in this case.  So once they stop fighting each other, maybe they'll feed daddy.  

BTW, how do you fathers of multiple children deal with , say one is 1.5 years old, barely understanding things, but quite feisty.  Doesn't understand that the 3.5 year old has his toys that she cant touch.  But she doesn't understand this yet.  She only knows to give it back to him when he starts crying for it.  But he gets impatient and starts sacking her, at that point she will refuse to give it back and fight back.... how do I end this????  should i?  should I make him share? 

I've been telling my older son to give her one of her own toys whenever she wants to take one of his.  Or to trade for something he's not using doesn't want..  But he's still very possessive of his own toys.  Glad you weren't hungry for hot soup.My son is the same, only fall a sleep when i carry him on my arm.
Pro tip: Turn the baby around. Keep her shoulder as high up on your arm as you can (by the elbow, where her bum is now in the picture, or even higher up). 
This will be easier for you as all her weight is really in her head, and when she gets heavier you will feel the difference. 
Also it's safer (in my opinion). You can hold her thigh real easy with your hand. Instead of her head, so if she moves you won't have to stress her neck. 
Check this image: http://i.imgur.com/U3tm5.png
See how he holds the thigh? thats the secret to it beeing really comfortable, since you can have your other hand kinda free.
It's recommended that you put your other hand ontop of the child any way, but when you feel you got the hang of it. Youll notice how good it feels.Have you thought of swaddling? works like a charm for little babies. I had preemie twins and it was a life saver.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSYPqGtFBYQDon't let her get used to that bro, she'll end up one of those girls you can eat sushi off of...Man, I haven't laughed at a photo like that in the longest time. She looks like an awesome little chipmunk and I'm sure she'll appreciate you rocking that pic at her 21st birthday party. Congrats man.

A real man is not defined by macho bull shit.  A real man is a man who puts the needs of his children and family before his own.  The sacrificial man. I didn't figure this out until I had children of my own.

It is the innocence of children that forges a mans true strength. But I didn't need to say it. It is clear from the photo that you already understand.

What do all the buttons and levers do? Couple years ago when my son was a toddler he was obsessed with garbage trucks, absolutely in love with them.  Every Friday morning we would sit on the balcony of our 3rd story apartment and watch the big ole WM truck come empty out the dumpsters and my son was just captivated, no matter how many times he had seen them before.

Now my parents lived in a little town about 35 minutes away, and we would visit them at least once a week.  My folks are oddly generous and every week when the garbage men come through their neighborhood my mom will go out there and give them all cold bottles of water, gatorade or soda.  Its just a little thing that has endeared my parents to the garbage men.  

Well just so happens that my sons 3rd bday fell on whatever day of the week was garbage day in my folks neighborhood.  While we were at their house the garbage truck comes rumbling along.  I ran out there as my mom was getting them their drinks and explained that my son just loved the shit out of garbage trucks and offered them $20 to let us have a little ride around the neighborhood.  

The driver refused the money but took us around the neighborhood anyway.  I gave the money to his partner and told him to go have a few rounds on me after work.   For the next year everytime they saw my son and I they would give us a ride, all in all we had 3 ride alongs.   

There's not really a point to this story, other than OPs pic brought back one of my favorite memories of all time.  My son was so god damn excited, but also felt pretty special, which of course made my week.I see ""JAG OFF"" stickers...Pittsburgh? Do you like your job? I've been thinking about being a garbage man. What cool stuff have you found?i'm not sure if you're aware of this...but both of my children LIVED for garbage day when they were small.  they would loose it when they heard the truck and we would run out (no matter what state we were in) to stand on the porch and watch.  we would always say hello and chat briefly with the guys.  (never a lady on my route).  so i'm not sure if you know, but you are ACTUAL heros to many kids out there.  they love you.  what's in the bag?This guy has GOT TO BE from Pittsburgh.

That and ""the shocker""...So instead of giving my trash men beer for the holidays, I should just give them cool stickers for the inside of the truck? I can do that.""Stay Drunk."" Probably not the best sticker to have in your truck. How comfortable is it sitting in there?
lots of people like to think their jobs are important but aren't.  If I didn't go to work for a week who would care?  realistically....no one.  If a garbage man didn't go to work for a week....FUCKING CHAOS.[removed]what country? i used to work as a garbagetruckman in sweden and ours were a whole lot more modern than that, also ended up making them personalized, not so much with stickers but with other things.

remember hooking up a stereo-speaker system to the rear and connecting it to the musicplayer so we didnt miss the song/the radio speaker when getting off to work.

you make surprisingly much as a garbageman in sweden too. i made roughly twice the national average a month from the garbageman job and i finished so early i could have a second part-time job after. worked between 6-10 (rouhly, we got off work when finished with our route, also sometimes had slightly earlier hours) and then had a second work starting at 1pm.

ironically you end up making almost three times swedens national average as a garbageman that way, which is fun because everyone treats you as if you're below them somehow, if only they knew.

also, note to americans, we make very little money in sweden (made up for by a lot of things being ""free"" etc) so the national average monthly salary is ""just"" 2500 a month, however this is enough to have a lower middleclass lifestyle, so it is comparable with ""a lot"" more by US standard of salary.

however, if you have a high paying job in sweden (4000 usd +) you would be better off as an american, as the swedish system is less rewarding when you succeed but gives you more room to succeed.

anyway, just my story.

tl;dr

garbagemen can make 6000+ usd monthly, where as swedens national average is 2500 usd monthly.You from Pittsburgh? We're going to the cup ya JagHaha love the Edelbrock and Summit stickers, now I'm imagining a garbage truck with a scoop and dual 4 barrel high-rise carbs tearing ass through the neighborhood scaring all the children./r/garbagetruckporn I'm surprised they let you decorate it so much like that.

Was it posted?  We occasionally get deaths from people entering the glacial ice caves here in Washington.[deleted]Kinda depressing story ...

When I was 16 I went on an Alaskan cruise.  I got food poisoning and was in bed or throwing up through most of the trip, but I was well enough to watch the cruise through and past a whole bunch of glaciers next to each other.  One after the other.  It was amazing.  It felt like they were SO close to me and the ship.  Totally amazing seeing them all dead end into a big body of water.

So this year I went on the same kind of cruise again.  I'm 31 now and decided it was time to go and not get deathly ill.  It was a great cruise this time, but when it came to cruise past those VERY SAME glaciers ... they were almost gone.  They had receded SO FAR back up the mountains that we were hardly able to get close to them at all.  I had to use my binoculars just to see the detail I was able to see just looking out a window last cruise.  

The amount of melting, just in the short 15 years I had been there last, was SO fucking depressing to me.

tl;dr:  Went to Alaska 15 years apart.  Glaciers are disappearing.  We're fucked as a species.In the years to come when this is reposted kids will ask ""what's a glacier?""This image reminds me of a documentary of Inuit mussel-gatherers waiting for the sea ice to drop so they can break through the ice and harvest mussels before the sea rises again. Here's the documentary by BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMZYDQ6v24How thick is the ice above you? Seems like sunlight can get throughI now realize if Superman had his ice fortress it would have melted by now.

They're huge!How dangerous is that? I went camping at some ice caves a few years back (not inside, just near them) and there were signs everywhere saying to not go in them and if you do to not make any noise in them. In fact, a few months back a person was killed and some injured due to back to back collapses in a matter of days.

Pervert frog is watching you.[deleted]I never would have guessed that a cute picture of a frog could hide such a shitstorm of OP-hating and drama. I wish I had an awesome shower frog :/He keeps the bugs down. I like it.Oh man, frogs are kickass. I remember when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old, me and a friend made some traps out of plastic bottles. We caught around 20 frogs and one trout in a single day. Ended up digging an old aquarium out of the basement and putting them in that. Made a lot of land space with aquarium sand, had a little watery bit and put the trout in there. Only problem was that my room didn't have enough space, so I had to put it in my 3 year old sisters room. Turns out frogs can jump *(Who knew)*, and will do so if put in a shitty aquarium. I awoke to the sound of my little sister laughing like a maniac and my mother flipping shit. Ran in to see the room, including my little sisters crib fucking covered in frogs. God damn that was hilarious. Then my mother found the trout. More shit was flipped, and I had to set the frogs, and the god damn motherfucking trout free in our garden. **I released a motherfucking trout into the natural fucking habitat of my god damn front lawn!** He had it coming though, that trout was a dick. Smug bastard. Watching 20 something frogs, and one trout jump around on the lawn was good fun. Me and that friend ended up having a lot of fun with frogs and trouts that summer.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, take good care of that frog, he might very well save your life one day. Oh, and trouts are dicks.He has licked your toothbrushI have never seen a group of people so concerned on the states of someone's else's shower in which they will never be. I think it's really cool that you have a little amphibian buddy in there, but the people who are bothered by him being near your toothbrush are right - frogs can carry salmonella and other germs that you don't want to get in your mouth.I like frogs a lot, he's pretty cute.  I can't help thinking he'd be happier outside.He doesn't bother you, but I bet he bothers all over your toothbrush.Frogs, like other reptiles and amphibians, can have salmonella on their skin.  Right next to your toothbrush *might* not be be the safest place to let him chill.I've got quite a few of this same species of frog living on my property (like OP, I'm also in Florida) and about two years ago we had a record breaking cold winter night. It pretty much devastated all of my tropical plants and killed dozens of these little guys. They were strewn about my property like little frozen frogsicles.

Anyway, that same morning I woke up to a frog swimming around my toilet. I had no idea how it got in there, but I calmly escorted him out of the house. On my way back in my wife shrieked, ""there's a frog in the toilet!"" To which I replied that I already got him out. But clearly I didn't because, sure enough, there was a frog in the toilet. And then another and another and another...

All told, there were around 20 frogs in the toilet itself and the pipes leading to it. According to the plumber who was hired to get them out, they crawled in there for warmth (and probably did so through the vent). It was one of the most bizarre things I'd ever experienced but the plumber disagreed, ""Nothing peculiar about it. Just got some frogs in your toilet.""

Gotta love Florida.you're gonna be pissed as fuck when he turns out to be a she and shits frog spawn all over your shower. Pissed As Fuck.

Here's an excellent explanation from NASA:

http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/30may_solareclipse2/

> ""Solar images formed by pinholes, crossed fingers, patches between leaves, all occur because of diffraction--a wave property of light. In the case of a pinhole, the light rays do not shoot straight by the rim of the hole, but bend around the edge. This wave effect creates a diffraction pattern of rings on the screen which resembles a bull's eye. That's for a flat wave single light source. If the aperture is illuminated by a scene, it acts as a lens to image the scene on a screen. With the right size hole relative to the right distance to a screen, a clear image is formed. That's the general principle of a pinhole camera.""
> 
> ""Applying this to an eclipse observation, the sun becomes the object to view. Point the pinhole camera at the sun and you see a solar image (projected on a screen) dim enough your eyes can enjoy.""
> 
> ""But the pinhole effect doesn't need a designed aperture. The solar image can be formed by any aperture if the shadow is the right distance away. The sunrays though tree leaves work to make a solar image on the ground below. Blinds on the window will covert a square opening into a round sun on the wall.""
> 
> ""The marvel is that diffraction doesn't need a round hole to form an image. A square pinhole will also work if its area is the same. Even for a random edged shape, the wave bending will average out to form an image of the scene contained in the incident light. That's why the spots of light through the trees are round; the gaps in the foliage are imaging the sun. ""I... Don't understand how the sun being partially blocked would change the shadows that a tree casts.Who's the dipshit building attack-speed Soraka?That's an amazing shot! The tree leaves act similar to how pinhole cameras work, [leaving these little eclipse casts](http://i.imgur.com/Y20dSSJ.png)Go see for yourself during the [next eclipse](http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html) near you.For those doubting, it [works like this.](http://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x400/pinholeprojectionpaper.jpg)This guy. Think about all of the cameras pointed up at the moon when this was taken, and this smart guy is facing the opposite way.The last time a total eclipse happened in my area, I was 7 or 8. We were in school and we all went out with our two pieces of paper to see the pinhole effect. I was a hyper kid and my teacher hated me so as soon I started to get the least bit out of hand she sent me to sit on the curb in the shade and miss the eclipse. I was super bummed seeing as how I really liked science stuff. As I sat there I started to notice all the shadows changing around me. It was like millions of little pinhole eclipses all around me. All of the rest of the class was out in the parking lot with their shitty paper pinholes but I had my own personal light show. It was cool as shit. Thanks for bringing back that memory OP. It happensh here in Shcotland, too. My ash looksh like a shilver-birch! 
http://imgur.com/ZSbxkuLI know what's happening here! My physics teacher showed us an extremely similar photo. It's called a pinhole camera. The leaves in the tree have tiny little holes in them that the sunshine is passing through. This causes the image to be projected upside down on to the house like that. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera

Fun fact! If you wear glasses get a piece of paper and poke a tiny hole in it. Look through it without your glasses with one eye and you should be able to see clearly through the hole.Pretty sure if you had a staff with a gem on it you could stick it in the ground and use mirrors to uncover ancient secretsi saw this once in...1993 I think?  I was walking to class and saw half moons all over the sidewalk.  I knew right away what it was.

Luckily I was going to the engineering building and they has all kinds of stuff to look at it.  the best was looking through a compact disc.toenail clippings...everywhere.Looks like Porom and Palom just cast FlareAlso, during near-totality, overhead power and communication lines will throw sharp shadows. Normally they don't throw a shadow at all because they are much thinner than the sun's disk.Photographer and light enthusiast here. What you're looking at here is the camera obscura effect. One of the most underrated and unheard of properties of light.Huh, Oberon is real.

Walk of shameThis reminds me of my old 'triever, Ben. Like most of 'em he loved water, even when he was reeeally old.

We went to house sit for some friends in Dorset (UK) when he was about 12 and cracking on a bit (actually lasted till 16 bless him). One day I took him and my much younger german shepherd Sadie for a walk, and we came across this sort of drainage ditch/ stream that was about as deep as I am tall and about the same distance across, so pretty deep and steep. Ben smells the water and, with a speed I didn't realise he was still capable of, decides to clamber down to it. He sank up to his belly in mud. I went in after him and tried to haul him out but the sides were too high - the best I could do was hold him in my arms against the side of the ditch so he didn't sink any deeper. We were good and stuck.

The antics of my frantic younger dog and my panicked shouts eventually attracted the attention of another dog walker, and I begged her to go back to where we were staying, about half a mile away, and get my mum. She headed off after tying Sadie to the bridge over the ditch for me.

I waited for what seemed like hours, probably about half an hour, up to my calves in pretty cold mud, covered in more mud and a copious amount of hair, holding an exhausted dog. I was wearing a sundress, so my arms and legs were covered in scratches as well. 

Suddenly, firemen! My mum had called them after hearing the description of the ditch. I have never been so happy to see firemen. In minutes they had placed Ben into a large tarp and hauled him out of there and pulled me out. Mum and Ben got a lift back in the fire engine but they couldn't fit me and Sadie, and I was pretty much a mud person by then. I didn't want to ruin my shoes so I ended up walking back barefoot with a frantic germen shepherd stepping all over my feet on a gravel road with no pavement.

By the time I got back my mum had made the firemen (must have been about 8 of them at least) cups of tea. She then got the hose out to start hosing Ben down and the bastard started running around the garden to get away from the water with all the energy of a dog half his age.

The firemen did offer to pressure hose me but I declined.

**TLDR - elderly dog tried to swim in a 6ft deep, steep sided ditch full of mud, I got stuck trying to get him out, got covered in mud, hot firemen rescued me looking like a cavewoman, dog regained enough energy to run away from the hosepipe afterwards.**How hard did you laugh?[deleted]I thought this was a honey badger from the thumbnailThat's the difference from a Lab and a Golden.

https://secure.npca.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1391Well, fuck. What's Cali complaining about? I can see shit loads of water.[This is from a trip I made a few months ago, here's a link to more if anyone's interested.](http://imgur.com/a/08QJN)In Oregon, the entire coastline is public. You cannot buy it. California has many robust laws governing development, particularly in coastal areas.  Laws like the California Coastal Act prohibit restricting public access to beaches and make all development on the coast subject to government review.  The California Environmental Quality Act gives *anyone* legal standing in court to litigate against a permitting agency (City, County, etc.) if the agency has not fully disclosed, evaluated, and mitigated for environmental impacts resulting from a development.  CEQA especially is used by environmental activist groups to prevent development in pristine habitats.  It's not a 100% effective method to prevent development, however.  Usually the goal is to delay the project so long that the developer runs out of money or the investment loses its profitability and they give up.

A great example of a beautiful place in California that was slated for luxury development is the [Gaviota Coast](http://www.sblandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Gaviota-Morning-Tajiguas.jpg) near Santa Barbara.  The development proposed on that land was litigated for decades before the developer went bankrupt.that's definitely big sur.I'm a land use planner who, with my colleagues, manages the Local Coastal Program for a northern California county. The majority of my day is spent getting yelled at by landowners who don't understand why they can't develop their land however they would like. Thanks for appreciating the reason I get yelled at all the time! Speaking of protected coast, I just took a canoe ride down the Russian River here in CA. There were tons of spots on the shore that said ""Private shore, no stopping here."" Is there no protection for river access? That seems crazy to me.For those of us who want to preserve wild space in the Bay Area, check out [Peninsula Open Space Trust](http://www.openspacetrust.org). They use donations to buy up land and create parks and other protected open space. 

They help keep my weekends looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/gm9pKRp.jpg).

This was taken in Etosha National Park, Namibia [edit: detailed location removed, see comments below]. I waited at a waterhole for 7 hours from noon to 7pm. There was very little wildlife activity during the afteroon, and only a few springboks showed up to drink. At around 6pm the sky was still overcast and I almost decided to leave, but eventually decided to stay until the end of the day. The real show started around 6:30pm as the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.

I went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.

I travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience. Go if you ever get the chance!

>From Wednesday, August 19, through to Sunday, August 23, the ninth Sail Amsterdam event will be held in Amsterdam. The popular opening parade runs for 12 kilometers and will consist of 50 tall sailing ships. Many of the vessels will have sailed there directly from Bremerhaven in Germany where another tall ships event ended last Sunday.

>In total, more than 1,000 vessels are expected to participate in the sailing extravaganza in IJ bay. Organizers expect up to two million visitors to attend the free event. According to them, Sail Amsterdam is the largest public event in the Netherlands - and the largest event of its kind in the world.

**Photo Details:**

This photo is a 26.6 MP photo  merged from two 24 MP shots from a Sony a7 camera. I had a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.4 manual focus lens (with a B+W filter for protection) attached. The two shots were merged using Lightroom's built in photomerge (which results in a single raw pano). Not much was done in Lightroom other than exposure changes, color changes and some healing brush to remove lens flare.

This photo was taken after I shot a 3 hour timelapse of the sunrise. I was just about leave, when I decided to actually take a few photos.

I've only built one brick/stone wall, but when we did it we started at the bottom.> Just as individual blocks were prepared, so too were the adjoining stones already set in the wall.  In order to receive a new block, bedding planes were carved into those stones below or to the side of the block to be added. This is how the Twelve-Angled Stone took on its busy upper outline; the upper portions of the block were recarved several times over as five blocks — set in a left to right sequence — were fitted along the course above.

> Other blocks in the wall were similarly shaped, then reshaped as new blocks were added to the masonry mass. As stones of irregular size and degree of finish were inserted into the mural fabric with fastidious technical consistency, the wall went up as tectonic sculpture.

- Adam Herring, “Shimmering Foundation: The Twelve-Angled Stone of Inca Cusco,” Critical Inquiry, Autumn 2010.

**Edit:**  Several comments questioned my use of ""nearly a thousand years."" Here's where I got that figure: according to wikipedia, Cusco was founded in 1100, and then occupied by the Inca ""from the 13th Century to the 16th Century."" I have no idea when that particular stone was laid, but it seems to have been somewhere between 500 and 900 years ago.  I was intentionally vague with the date, since I don't know the exact century. I've also seen suggestions that it predates the Inca. If someone has that info, I'd appreciate you commenting with it!

**Edit 2:**  Just out of curiosity, I went through and counted: as of right now, there are 54 top-level comments jokingly asserting that this was aliens.  There are 17 top-level comments that are literally just the word ""aliens.""  In the time it took me to count, 4 more were added.

[deleted]not gonna lie, but i'm kinda turned on by this...you should have seen their score at tetris....Why couldn't they have just made them all brick shaped and saved time and whatever they used for money back then. These guys were obviously getting paid by the hour.Ancient Aztec masons were agents of the Mexican Nuevo World Order as directed by the Illuminachos. I'm not saying it's aliens...But totally aliens.If there's one thing I've realised, it's that humans a thousand (or more) years ago were just as intelligent as we are today. Sure they didn't have anything like the technology we have, but they were just as skilled and had equally rich and complex lives as those we have today.Meanwhile, [last week...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O38QHzM0tzw/S-YAkoeP58I/AAAAAAAAB20/7FQ5sd8tv7k/s1600/IMG_1133.JPG)[there's no end to what you can do when you don't give a fuck about particular people](http://i.imgur.com/7R6PWWN.jpg)Quick Background before comment:  I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Architecture.  My thesis specifically focused on the integration of 3D printing technologies into masonry construction, using ancient approaches as a basis for design.

Now.  Something to know about these masonry walls is that they are not nearly as intricate and ""perfect"" as they appear to be.  From the outside (the face), the stones are chiseled using the surrounding stone as a basis.  On the interior of the wall, however, you will find that each of these stones is more ""wedge"" shaped, and is held in place with a plethora of smaller ""filler rocks.""  

From the outside, it looks impossible.  Once you look inside, you'll find that it's really just as simple as shaping one side of the rock, just along the edges.Peru was an amazing country to visit, I thoroughly enjoyed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. Some of the most amazing scenery. Anyone who has thought about going to Peru, fucking do it, spend at least a month there there's so much to see!

On a side note, I can't stand the ancient aliens bull shit. I don't think we give nearly enough credit to ancient peoples and their intelligence and ingenuity.

It's for him.

Because he's like Superman. Always has to watch his strength or he could hurt someone.

*Beware of dog*/r/blopSeriously though, beware of any dog you don't know. 

Too many people think ""lookit the liddle blep! I'mma poke it!"" Suddenly, you're in the dog's space and he's defensive, and the dog gets put down instead of the asshole who didn't beware of the fucking dog. 

90% of dogs would be okay with a pet in that situation. 10% would not. Don't risk it. Sadly this is probably for insurance purposes. Most companies ask what type of dog you have and if it belongs to one of the groups they feel are an issue they will ask if your yard is fenced and if you have a sign. This keeps your premiums from going up much higher than if you didn't have a sign or fence. Some municipalities also require it as well. I have several GSD's and my insurance agent about died when I exclaimed I didn't intend to fence my entire property. I told him they're all trained and won't hurt anyone unless commanded to. They didn't like that and tried to raise my rates so I just moved to a better carrier.""As long as you throw the ball, no one will get hurt"" Hey, that looks like my dog.

It was a miniature dachshund, I think her breed were known for being particularly nasty but this dog was the sweetest thing. 

She loved everything and everyone except one thing: The doorbell, her dreaded enemy. 

The doorbell going off was one of the few times we heard her bark. This dog was about 6-7 pounds at most but when she barked she sounded like she was the size of a husky.

It was the funniest thing, watching canvassers ring the bell and get this look of complete horror when the heard the barking. The look on their faces when they saw it was coming from a mini-dachshund was priceless.Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!I had a Siberian Husky that looked like a wolf. He was built like a machine, and looked ferocious, which was nice because I lived in a place kind of sketchy at night.

Twice my house was broken into with my giant direwolf downstairs & both times my dog barked & scared off the intruders.   
Instead of going to attack them, he was just saying ""Look at me"" then prancing towards him like a bubbly giant puppy hoping for head scratches.

People would cross the street to not have to walk near him, and he would bark trying to say ""Hey, I'm friendly please pat me on the head"" but everyone was scared of the love bug. Now I have a Shiba Inu & she's more of a guard dog than my Husky ever was.Seems as if he's trying to look at his own tongue and has gone cross-eyed. Like you do if you try to look at your own nose.The baddies are being lulled into a false sense of security, if they dare to hop the gate, evil pooch is hiding ready to pounce.:pThat's no ordinary dog.

* [Bonus images](http://imgur.com/a/jeJB6)Computer, one art please!Can we make a robot that runs on wine and talks shit about these paintings?Tübingen! I lived there! It's gorgeous!! I recognize Starry Night and The Scream, but what are the other paintings?As a salary-paid working artist I can't deny how exciting this is. Peoples first thoughts are obviously 'lol welp artists aren't needed', and to some very small corner of our industry, that may be true. But for me, I'm always looking for a new tool to speed up my workflow and this has incredible potential. A lot of times it's easier to stitch together photographs in interesting ways (called photobashing) instead of making a painting from scratch. I could see great situations where you spend time making one painting that has all the unique styling and flavor (a style frame or 'alpha' image ). Then spending the rest of your time making quick photo stitched illustrations not worrying about the final look, but focusing on the idea. When you've captured whatever ideas in your series of images, how cool would it be to input your 'alpha' image and let the neural network do its thing to the other photo-based illustrations. These are really exciting times!HA HA and the artist thought their jobs were protected from the machines.

Edit: I know artist are important it was a joke guys.The town depicted is Tübingen, Germany. Just saying, because its a small and irrelevant Town, people go to to study, but not much more :D damn people are smart here.. Nice pics too :DFrom a programming point of view this make me moist.ITT: ""it's Tübingen""Tübingen! I lived there for a yearHaha I lived in ""A"" for a couple of years! It's Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg for those who are interested.It doesn't seem like it recreates the photo with the style, it just seems like it attempts to recreate the photo AS the painting. You can see this most clearly in D, where the further half of the houses don't exist because in the painting there's just sky. Hell half of a house is still in the painting; it just seems to end half way through. It's still interesting, but I think you'd need some kind of AI to actually paint a photo in the painter's style like this tried to do.  This is probably going to get buried, but this article is very relevant:
https://mappingbabel.wordpress.com/2015/08/30/why-deep-learning-will-lead-to-new-troublesome-art/ It doesn't look like it works well with many images, just ones that have a similar composition.I threw a subreddit together for when tools become available. If you want to talk about, share results, and develop image style transfer tools you're welcome to stop by:

https://www.reddit.com/r/deepstyle/What happens when you use the Van Gogh style on Starry Night? Do you get (Van Gogh)^2?wow this is my home town! If anyone is wondering this is Tübingen in Germany and it's taken from the Neckarbrücke.

The picture is actually taken from wikipedia:

Sonny: Fuck yeah, bitch. Who needs artists when we have algorithms!

Yay for our future distopia! Awesome!What does neural mean when it comes to this?This is a taste of the (relatively) new field of ""non-photorealistic imaging"" from computer science.  Computers can make things photo-realistic (see this [Morgan Freeman video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEdRLlqdgA4)), but it's very difficult to make images appear as paintings. 

There have been great advances in this technology.  Does anyone remember the Keanu Reeves ""cartoon"" movie, [A Scanner Darkly] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY5PpGQ2OWY)?  Here is a 2006 [paper] (http://kucg.korea.ac.kr/seminar/2008/src/PA-07-12.pdf) that describes how they do this in real time.  It's not that difficult for a computer; the basic steps are:

- Get the ""Difference of Gaussian"" line edges (find edges in the picture)
- Make a line drawing of the image from the above step
- Fill in the colors by doing a ""Luminance Quantiziation""; the simple explanation is the computer divides the colors up into, say, 100 different shades.  Then, for each pixel, decide which shade to ""round"" to.  This gives a ""cartoony"" feel to the image
- Done!

Again, this is something that can be done in REAL TIME; it doesn't take a lot of processing to execute (Source: I did something very similar for my graduate work).

The images posted above are more complex.  For paintings, it gets a lot more complicated simply because of the vastly different styles.  Each painter had his/her own unique painting style such that one image can be interpreted so many different ways.  It's impossible to list all the different work in this field, but here are some papers which describe how we got the images posted:

- [Mean Curvature Flow] (http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0729052)
- [Flow-based bilateral filter] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.5240&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- [Non-linear diffusion] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=56205&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D56205)

There really are a TON more papers and the ones listed are relevant to the images posted.  Suffice to say, this is an emerging field, and while not ""perfect"", we are getting closer to non-photorealistic images.

If there's more interest, I'm happy to provide additional examples or (attempt) to explain the theory behind them!  This is an exciting time to work in digital images!

What about the inside. Plus bonus pics of his toolshedhere are some of the differences i can see:

* entire house addition on the right side. 
* front door relocated. 
* eavestrough added all around. 
* chimney appears to be moved further back, but that might just be perspective. 
* addional window added downstairs. 
* lighting added near the corners of the house. 
* siding is horizontal now instead of vertical.

Great on him for fixing up the house .At first I was like, *why didn't you take this from the same angle*, but then I realized the entire part on the right is essentially new. That's some serious renovation work. Very sharp lookingI love how the additions actually fit the architectural style of the house. So many shitty additions look like shitty additions.My uncle was only a carpenter as a hobby but his and my aunt's house is the same way.  It started out as a 1 bedroom house about as big a as a double wide trailer.  They've added 2 bedrooms, a den with a second story master bedroom above it, and a 2 car garage.  He's probably tripled the square footage.  Not to mention the couple of big storage sheds and deck he's also built in the back yard.That's a great looking house.I honestly really like the second window he added on the face of the house facing the camera You've got to be more than a carpenter to pull that off! Did he hire expertise for concrete, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or anything?In all seriousness it would be amazing to have those kind of skills.

I tried to run away but he had me cornered. As he closed the distance between us I tried to fight him off, but I must have blacked out afterwards, and then I woke up with another device implanted in my neck. I went to the bear doctor to have the last one removed, but they were only able to partially remove it. I'm really scared, and I don't feel like I'm in control of my life. 

Edit: typos. Well, at least that guys gonna go on to win an oscarITT: only jokes. What actually happened, is the guy ok?That bear had no idea he was about to fuck with a man wearing plaidMeanwhile, on Bear Reddit. Bear OP posts a photo of man in plaid in his hole ""Oh... Uh... Hi"". ""I don't need to crawl faster than the bear, just faster than this guy in front of me"" - some photographerAnyone else think that thumbnail looked like someone's eye ripped open?  I'm glad it's just a bear.Human food delivery service.At least he wore the brown pants.Worst. Colonoscopy. Ever. Unfortunately for this home invader, he is practicing his right to bear arms.

I'll see myself out. This one moment at the end of your life when you know that you are fucked.

The reason why I don't share them all is because they do not belong to me, and if the direct owners haven't shared them before, that is their decision.


There are many more pictures in the album. I've chosen a few that do not directly identify my uncle's family so as not to disturb their privacy any further. If you end up sharing these, please grant my wish by stating that they are part of a private collection and that they have been shared without permission, which is all I can do to take responsibility for it. I am concerned for breaching their trust, but I also believe that this bit of history belongs to all Mexicans and the allies they worked with. May they find some solace in this pride, specially in these times where we are deeply concerned about civil unrest.

They come from my great-uncle, who did serve in the 201st squadron. I am just a distant nephew, and my uncle's family treasures all these memories, not just as memento, but also because they, and my family (my father served with them in a special forces group) still serve to this day with a lot of pride and honor, and with this legacy in mind.


You'd be healthily skeptic to doubt me in light of all the drug trafficking, corruption and violence levels in the country, even within the military; but boy, would I be fucking damned if I let anyone slip every Mexican soldier under that umbrella.



The stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.


The reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:


Mexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.

You can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.



But just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.


It could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.


Sure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.



Let's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.

I just got patriotic for a country I am not from. I guess propoganda works.Great post OP. On a similar note, Alot of mexican americans fought in WWII but at the time there was only ""white or black"" on the census. Natrually mexicans where considered white (and many still do idenfity as such).

 This is part of why i enjoyed fury because it really made effort to be accurate in what was out there./r/propagandaposters has tons of stuff like this.'Muric...I mean...'Mexica?!Notice the two mountains in the background? Those are actually volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. They are very important to Aztec mythology. Legend has it Iztaccihuatl was an Aztec princess who fell in love with Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl was sent off to war, she was falsely told by her father that her beloved had died in battle, so in turn she died of grief. When the warrior returned to find his lover dead, he laid her to rest and kneeled beside her body to mourn her death.Here's a good write up on the 201st squadron. [Strike of the Aztec Eagles] (http://www.airartnw.com/aztec_eagles_story.htm) I picked a up a print a while back with the signatures of the few remaining pilots. If I were a Nazi - I'd be wondering where the rattlesnake went.  As I learned from WWE, don't turn your back on a rattlesnake.Aaaaand.... I have a new wallpaper vMexico declared war on the Axis Powers in support of the Allies on May 22, 1942, following losses of oil ships in the Gulf, most notably the Potrero del Llano and the Faja de Oro, to German submarine attacks. Although most American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and Brazil were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.

Perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the Mexican military was the Escuadrón 201, also known as the Aztec Eagles. This group consisted of more than 300 volunteers, who trained in the United States to fight against Japan. It was the first Mexican military unit trained for overseas combat.

After a bit of sleuth work I've found the load charts for the crane in the accident. From the information I've found the crane is a Leibherr LR1300 with 555' of boom. 
https://www.coastcrane.com/docs/default-source/lr1300/lr1300---2316-luffing-jib-capacity-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=2
Looking over the manual, with the configuration this crane was running, it was a limit of 15 mph winds. Reports are there were easily 30mph gusts(probably more between this buildings). 
This is all based on speculation and none of it is a fact, just felt like looking into it. Glad it wasn't worse than what it was!

I lived in NYC for a long time, and this is one of those things that I just never think about.  So many buildings are always under construction, and so many cranes are just sitting above you.

It's terrifying to think about.

I used to work at a coal fired power plant. The plant had tall stacks that peregrines would nest at every year, which was cool because they were endangered at the time. One day, I'm working on the roof on an AC unit and my coworker and I spot 2 peregrines flying past us. We stop and watch them for a second and we notice that 1 of them has something in his talons (a mouse or something we assumed). Then out of nowhere, right in front of us, the one with the mouse flies upside down, the other one grabs the mouse out of his talons, and then he flips back and they continue on into the distance. Makes me wonder how many people have ever seen something like that.

EDIT: Cool I didn't expect to get so much visibility on this!
Bonus Story: I took a break on the 10th floor and the falcons were nesting above where I was standing. They started gawking and divebombing at me because I guess their nest was nearby.Write a book about it called My Side of the SkyscraperFalcony?Humans can barely afford a walk-up with a shared bathroom in Chicago. How the Hell does a single income falcon afford a one bedroom with a nursery and a view?I like the how Hawks faces is like

They lost all their clutches of eggs two summers ago :(

Hopefully they'll be back next year"" sooo, is this going to be an issue or something?"" ""excuse me sir these are my fluffs and I'm going to have to ask you to take a few steps back""We have a peregrine falcon family that lives right above us in an apartment in Brooklyn. What I've learned over the past few years:

* The male (I assume) is as bad as a rooster in the mornings and will not shut up.
* They shit constantly. There are times in the summer when we pray for a good rain to clean off our terrace and there are often lovely white streaks down the sides of our windows.
* They are merciless murderers of pigeons.
* They do not like to eat the heads of pigeons. They are happy leaving those as little presents for us to try and keep our dog from eating.
* They will chirp kind of cutely outside a window from time to time.
* People like hearing about the falcon family that lives above you right up until they see a decapitated pigeon right in front of them that we hadn't noticed and cleaned up.

I just finished that area in The Witness last night.

The scale would ascend as I walked forward and descend as I walked backwards. I always found it neat how my brain somehow connected the 7 notes of a musical scale to the 7 colors in the visible spectrum while I was asleep.

https://www.everplans.com/blog/rich-guy-buries-million-dollar-bentley-to-prove-pointI can't imagine what his mother is going through. But maybe there's some comfort in knowing he helped so many others, which would be a feat for anyone, let alone an 11-year-old. He was still a child, and it would have been absolutely understandable if he'd thought of himself first. Very powerful picture.Signing up to be an organ donor is basically the easiest thing you can do to help save lives -- everyone should be an organ donor. This little boy is an example to us all.holy shit, death being the catalyst of life. no better way to end one's journey than by allowing others to continue theirs. My sister passed away recently.  She was an organ donor, and everyone involved in that process was incredibly respectful, compassionate, and above all grateful for her decision.  She saved the lives of several people directly, provided organs for research, and tissues which could wind up helping 100s of people.  As bad as it all was, it's some small comfort knowing that her death wound up helping others.[More information about this great human being in case anyone is interested.] (http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/11-year-old-chinese-boy-donates-organs-to-save-others.html)I always thought you couldn't donate if you had cancer?Relevant XKCD :

http://xkcd.com/659/To see these people bowing to a boy donating his organs, is such a powerful image. I got chills all over my body. the respect they have is so immense.Much respect to this young guy.I find it amazing how something as simple as a few people arching their backs in your direction can mean more than a thousand words of thanks.  
It's like a primitive way of showing appreciation from before we were able to communicate with words.  
It's also great seeing such a positive piece about China. Seems to be in an almost permanent state of negativity these days.  
Respect.I'm not sure if this is relevant, but here goes: 

My close friend took his life three months after he turned 22. Everyone was devastated and so caught off guard. He was so loved. Anyway, during his funeral I was so upset that I didn't think there was anything that could be said that could take away my grief. Well, I was wrong. He was an organ donor. They were able to use pretty much every single organ from the neck down and his eyes. The pastor of the funeral told us that because of his death, his eyes allowed a child to see for the first time. Whoever that kid was is so lucky, his eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue. Miss you, buddy.

 There's nothing that can take the pain away, but I hope for this child's family, the knowledge that he has given others a new chance will help. This will probably get buried but when I was in high school I had a friend who suffered brain damage after being hit by a car while he was crossing the street. He lived for the following three days before his death. He, too, was an organ donor, and the day after his death a story was reported of an anonymous 18 year old boy who had donated his liver to save a young girl. We all knew it was his. Following his death he donated any organ possible, from his heart to his kidneys to his corneas. He was a healthy young man whose death made an immediate and powerful impact on other people's lives. It's a sad but bittersweet story that I'll never forget. Most of the school followed through and became organ donors soon thereafter. RIP Robb. fuck...its too early to feelHere's the whole story in Chinese with more photos, if you guys are interested in, I will try to give a brief translation

Edit: Very rough one, please forgive any typos and grammar mistakes

The boy’s name is **Yaoyi Liang**. He came to Shenzhen (close to Guangzhou) 2 years ago with his older brother and sister, who are seeking jobs in this metropolitan.

04/12/2014, his sister noticed Yaoyi was having slight movement disorder, and even fell out one time. Yaoyi was sent to hospital immediately next morning, the examination told that it was brain cancer. The family originally thought modern medical technology could save the little boy, however, after 2 surgeries on 04/16 and 05/08 respectively, things didn't get any better.

Yaoyi had been dreaming to become an astronautic scientist/engineer before he was diagnosed the illness. However he changed his mind, he hoped that if he could recover, he would try his best to be a doctor to help relieving the pain of others. During the period, he showed incredible maturity, never really complains the pain but tried to comfort his mother. 

When it came into June, Yaoyi himself seemed to realize it was coming to the end. He said to his mom:” if I can’t survive, please donate my body.” The family came from rural area in China, his mom who was under-educated, can’t really get what her boy was talking about. And then she realized. At the beginning, his sister was strongly against the idea, as per Chinese tradition, it is peaceful only when whole body is buried. After some time, the family understood, that was also another form of living in this world.

06/06, 11:45 AM, Guangzhou Zhongshan 1st Hospital, relatives of Yaoyi were called; 4:35 pm, Yaoyi peacefully passed away. 5:19pm, Yaoyi’s kidney and liver were collected, and would have transplant to others within 8 hours to save their lives. Yaoyi has become the 142th multi-organ donator in Shenzhen.
I wasn't aware that cancer patients could donate their organs. Are there not concerns about unknown metastasis, circulating tumour cells or circulating free DNA?

Edit: I read further into the thread and this is discussed, never mind! What was his name? This picture is amazing and this child deserves the dignity of his name being known Way to go kid. I'm very proud of youEvery day I come to Reddit for laughs and leave with tears. Reddit is the first ten minutes of Up in constant loop. My grandma received a heart from a young man who died when dove off a pier.  This was in the 90s and they told her she only had about 5 years to live with it and everyone else who did the program.  Thankfully she was given another 18 years.  This was enough to see me be born and grow up. Although she unfortunately passed away a year before I graduated high school, I am so glad I got to know her.  Without someone donating their organs that would have never happened.  Every year my grandma would have a second birthday on the young man that gave her the heart's birthday.  She would go to his grave and release a heart shaped balloon.  Powerful. I wish it was higher resolution so I could frame it and hang it up at my uni accommodation. Pictures like this push me through med school.An 11 year old makes the decision to save as many lives as he can, in the face of impending death. I can't get most full grown adults I know to make a reasonable decision if their life depended on it. This young... child, hero, saint... whatever you call him, had little knowledge and experience of many of the truly wonderful joys and experiences of life, yet was wise enough, and kind enough to ensure others to get a chance he never will. Its much too bad that with type of selflessness and concern for fellow man this child held, that he didn't get many more years to make the world a better place. We need more people like him.I haven't felt this sensation of moisture coming out of my eyes in a while. It's not sadness, it's more a deep sense of respect and admiration.

I was in Seattle for business last summer. The first 4 days I was there, the weather was what you think of as typical for Seattle: grey and cloudy.

On the morning of my 5th day there, the clouds cleared out and it became sunny, so I went for a walk around the building I was working in, as I had done every day. 

I turned the corner of this building and I was totally taken by surprise by Mt. Rainier just appearing on the horizon. I'd looked in that direction the last 4 days and seen nothing, so I was so shocked by the size of it. It looked totally fake, towering over the landscape by itself, and I just stood there, staring at it for about the next 5 minutes. It was one of the most beautiful and awe inducing things I ever seen.

[deleted]Looks like it might be an attempt at a modern day extinction event.I see Mr. Ross went all out with the Prussian Blue, there!""I will kill all of you one day, just wait....""Moved to Seattle while the clouds were still blocking the view of Mt Ranier. The clouds can block it from view for weeks at a time.  Friends kept saying that Ranier hasn't come out yet. My response was ""how will I know when I see it?""
""Oh, you'll know."" You don't realize how huge the thing is until you see it for yourself!
so if Mt. Ranier is 60 miles away from Seattle, and a pyroclastic flow travels at 500 mph, and Bob, who is having lunch at Pike Place  stares at the beautiful exploding mountain for 30 seconds before running to his car which just happens to be right outside, how far can Bob get before he's suffocated by searing gas and choking ash as he watches the city disappear? Extra credit for what kin of car he's driving. Brilliant photo!

If anyone is wondering, you get this type of effect by using a zoom lens (like 200 or 300mm) and zooming in, which makes images in the distance appear much bigger. Photos like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/rEIhvQt.jpg) are also created with this method.

I have never seen it look like this, but usually all the lights in the building are on. When I saw it last the projector was shining random symbols, letters, and numbers. It's pretty trippy to see it in person. It is just a string that spins all wibbly-wobby and as it passes in front of the light from the projector you see an image or color or whatever.

Is it just me or is that one massive dick?Well one thing that is interesting is that Harrison Ford is an able handyman and carpenter. Early on after he moved to Los angeles to do Radio voice overs he became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two small sons. While working as a carpenter, he became a stagehand for the The Doors. He also built a sun deck for actress Sally Kellerman and a recording studio for Brazilian band leader Sérgio Mendes.

What landed him his big break is funny. In 1972 He was hired to build cabinets at George Lucas's home. who subsequently cast him in a pivotal supporting role in the 1973 film, 'American Graffiti'. Lucas and Ford became good friends after that. In 1975, Lucas hired him to read lines for the actors auditioning for the film Star Wars. It wasn't until he had done line readings for a couple months that George Lucas, with the studio's ok, gave him the role of Han Solo.

Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the behest of local authorities. During his assigned duty time assisting the Teton County Search and Rescue he has aided in two mountain rescues. On one of the rescues Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. The hiker boarded Ford's helicopter and proceded to vomited on him unaware of who the pilot was until much later; The hiker is quoted as saying, ""I can't believe I barfed on Harrison Ford!""

I guess she will have to be her own best friend now.Every time I see Harrison Ford, I get the feeling that we are all bothering him. 

I think it makes me like him more.He chose... WISELY.I can't believe that man is 70.  That's just ridiculous.  I would bang that like a screen door in a hurricane.I think I gayed a little...Argh can't believe he is 70..

He said that they were amazed by the plethora of stuff you could buy in a grocery store. If you had been caught taking photos illegally, what kind of punishment would be typical?

I'd expect your camera would be confiscated or you'd be forced to delete the photos, but was there any threat of being detained or anything?Looking at your full photo series, these are some amazing candid photos of life in North Korea that I have never seen anywhere else.  The one thing that struck me was that any picture that wasn't in a city had food growing in it, and the hills were almost denuded of trees.In North Korea, there are places you can visit and places you cannot visit, and the latter are far more numerous. Well, this is one of them. Usually, we were accompanied by our guides, one in the front, one in the back. But at one point they were both in the front, which allowed for a literally 15-second long detour into this ordinary shop for North Koreans. That gave me maybe 10 seconds to take this picture, before being kicked out by the ""bad cop"" guide, and the atmosphere became rather unpleasant. I'm not sure if he saw me taking these pictures.

Also, I've got a photo album with the photos of my journey into North Korea, if anyone is interested.Nicely done!  Would love to see more of those ""staged"" North Korean areas to see the parity.My Chinese girlfriend has been to North Korea and had these pics to share.

Thanks for taking the time out to post this to Reddit.  With all that said, I have a couple questions for you.  :)

First, did you ever have any experiences where you felt somewhat anxious or unnerved (guards acting threatening, eyeing you up, etc.)

Second, were there any Americans with your group?  I'm curious if they would allow Americans at all (I know they did in the past, but obviously they can change that at any time).  

Thanks again.  Love your pictures.  This is actually worthy of a publication like National Geographic picking up on this or maybe a story in the NYT.

http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/

Their most famous member is John Dobson, who apparently just died. He invented/popularized the telescope design that the OP's photo shows - it's called a ""Dobsonian"" mount.

There's a documentary about him called A Sidewalk Astronomer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sidewalk_AstronomerSo did you take a look at jupiter?We need more people like this who want to share the amazing parts of the world, just for the satisfaction of opening eyes to new things.Holy shit I would jump all over that.

Where was this?On our honeymoon to Hawaii, my wife and I went to a roof top observatory at our hotel.  There were about 10 other couples for that viewing and not one of them ever stopped talking and half the people didn't look through the fucking telescope.  Here was this super enthusiastic guide with a very expensive telescope and a super dark sky, trying to talk and these fuckers were completely ignoring him while having their own conversations (loudly).  It was $25 a person and absolutely awesome.  To this day I have no idea what the fuck those assholes were up there for.  Really Cool, not at all sad. lots of people have never looked through a telescope, ever. It's really something!!Some people just want to watch the world learn!Except he is blind, and the telescope is pointed at the sun.A couple years ago while camping my kids (12 and 10 at the time) and I set up our good set of binoculars on the tripod to look at Jupiter. While wasn't much more than a bright dot you could also see four of the moons quite clearly.

As we were looking a girl in her early 20's walked by and asked what we were doing. My oldest (a budding astronomer) explained in detail about the planet, the moons, distances etc. Pretty soon we had a line of people wanting to look with my junior astronomer giving lessons. 

People are hungry for this kind of thing. All it takes is giving them an opportunity. 

And my kid learned when to just shut up and nod when some drunk guy started in about some conspiracy about satellites instead of trying to correct him.the old shoe-polish-on-the-lookie-hole gag... *classic*I took this iPhone photo of Saturn through a telescope like that.

He sets up like 3 or 4 scopes for anyone that wants to look. One of them is a big Meade LX series. I think it's the 8 inch. That's a big heavy thing to lug around and set up and he does it like 3 nights a week. He's a real cool dude.This man and his telescope alone could inspire a child to pursue science and astronomy and that would be beautiful. My former neighbor (an astrophysicist) used drop fliers all around the neighborhood inviting people to come join him for skywatching out in front of his house. He'd set up his telescope and enthusiastically talk about the things we were looking at. Unfortunately no one other than my family ever bothered to show up. They didn't know what they were missing!In the tradition of John Dobson.. some good old sidewalk astronomy! :)I think that's awesome that he is so excited about it that he wants to share it with everybody.  Far worse ways to spend your retirement, like feeding coins into a one-armed-bandit.I miss my grandpa. :( This same fellow showed me Saturn outside a dark bar in New York City 20 years ago.  It changed my life forever.A good buddy of mine got his PhD in Astrophysics . . . while he was in his program, he was very involved in outreach.  He sometimes set up telescopes on the streets of Harlem, and told me about a mother who cried when seeing the reaction of her kid as he looked through the telescope. That's damn cool, and perhaps THE most expensive telescope you will ever see in your entire life. That model of telescope costs thousands of dollars.

The only more powerful ""commercial"" scopes available are the types that are ""fold-out"" (look em up - basically what OP posted but with additional tubing/magnification). You will typically ONLY find these the fold-out type available to the public during public dark site meetings. 

Usually the only people who get to use such high powered equipment are those who own them, those who are in the field, and students at universities that attend classes which go to dark sites (AND, those who attend PUBLIC dark-site meetings, which very few know about).

I had the great joy in my life of taking an astronomy class (a great interest of mine, but no where near my degree) in which, for a grade, we had to attend a dark site twice. It was AMAZING. I actually got to see Saturn AND it's rings through one of these ultra powerful type telescopes. I was even able to snap of a picture through the eye port with an old film camera of the rings and when developed you could still make out the rings. 

I strongly recommend you look up local 'dark sites', which is where you will find FREE use of sweet shit like this.

I just hope this comment gets a few views, instead of all the bullshit comments that are at the top.I would of spent as much time as he was willing to give, talking to him. A lot of people see older folks as a nuisance but I love learning and interesting talk so I often talk to older folks. Especially ones with awesome telescopes who probably share the same great interest in space like I do.The man who invented that type of telescope mount, John Dobson, used to do that exact thing.  He'd setup a telescope in public for anyone to look through.  He died this year.I set mine up at the local park during the last eclipse and during the transit of Venus. :)I was reading a post yesterday about awful it is when older people act more arrogant, greedy, and just generally more unpleasant as they age. The consensus was that a lot of these elderly folks simply reach a point where they say ""fuck it,"" and just don't give a shit anymore, which often leads down a negative route of insensitivity and apathy.

This fuckin' boss of an old man, however, has taken the ""fuck it"" attitude and harnessed something truly amazing. He's decided, ""fuck it, am going to take my telescope-in-a-red-suitcase-with-wheels, set up shop in a parking lot, and *give* something to people. A different planet every day. No, every hour. Fuck it, doesn't matter, because I'm the fuckin' guy in charge, and I'm the one who decides which planet my fuckin' interchangeable sign will display.""

It's a closer look at the universe, a glimpse into the past, and a bit of magic all rolled into one.

Scarlett herself had been severely burned in the process of pulling her kittens from the fire. Her eyes were blistered shut, her ears and paws burned, and her coat highly singed. The majority of her facial hair had been burnt away.

Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we say, love. 

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye, and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot has appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" 

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. 

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. 

Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear-Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. 

Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 

He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.

Those are sequences of sandstone, shale, and some limestone.  Shales are only deposited in deep oceans while sandstones are deposited near shore.  Limestones are deposited only in shallow marine waters.  You may ask, then why does the sequel switch or repeat? Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so ""floats"" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions.Almost 6,000 years of geological history right there!

And an interesting bit form an interview he gave in December:

> ""You know what? I used to say, every day, 'I am so sick and tired of shaving.' I had to shave every day, every day, for 33 years,"" he explained. ""And even before that when I was working on local TV. And I just thought, the first thing I will do when I am not on TV is stop shaving. And everybody hates it. My wife hates it. My son hates it,"" he explains. ""But it's interesting. I've kind of developed a real creepy look with it that I'm sort of enjoying. I can tell that people are off-put by it. And the more people implore me to shave, the stronger my resolve is to not shave.""

He's exercising, he doesn't have to shave, he's gone back to college and joined the girls' volleyball team...  

I see nothing wrong here.It's like someone took the Ring from him and now his body is catching up to his age.

Letterman had hair?!Still reppin' Ball State, the only thing keeping Muncie, IN alive. 

Edit: Holy turds, I've got some reading to do. Figured a comment about Muncie on reddit would get buried af. Even though I haven't lived there since 1982, Muncie still holds a special place in my heart. I spent summers with my grandparents there growing up. Now I have to get nostalgic for a minute. Lots of fond memories of Pizza King (I'd kill for a Royal Feast right now), the Baskin Robbins and the movie theater it was attached to, cinnamon raisins biscuits from Hardee's, swimming and learning to play golf at the Delaware, trips to Upland to go to Ivanhoe's, Aladdin's Castle at the mall and beef manhattan's from the MCL, the urine stenched slide at Mitchell elementary, watching the cooks make the pizza at Noble Roman's, the children's museum, I'll^just^stahp^here^onions.

Edit #2: Just thought of a story about the first and last time my sister got to see the house my mom grew up in. My parents moved the family to Texas before my sister was born. My mother grew up poor and things were tough for her as a child. Growing up, she wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Muncie and leave it in her past forever. My mother, sister and I had to go back to Muncie for a funeral several years ago. While there, my sister wanted to see where my mom was raised and asked me to drive by, though my mother wanted no part of it. Let's just say the house was east of Broadway and south of McGalliard. I warned her that this would probably only happen once, if it was even still standing. I pulled up and parked out in the street, but told my sister we would not be getting out of the car. We sat for all of two minutes before I sped off, my mom in tears and my sister terrified. ""Neighbors"" started coming out of their homes to case us, yell at us and were rapidly approaching the car to do who knows what. It wasn't a fun trip.Since for some reason no one thought to post a picture of what he used to look like, apparantly assuming everyone in the world has seen his show, I give you this image.

I hope that helps.He looks like the guy who used to give me cough medicine that made me sleepy. are.... are those old walkman headphones???http://i.imgur.com/4qrCN9r.gifvThis is understandable. He has looked a certain way for decades (shaven, hair in a certain way, suit) so of course he would want to switch it up now that he has the opportunity. Also he might want some privacy now that he is retired. He was awesome the last few months on air. There were no fucks given!He used to jog around my high school's track in Connecticut. Used to see him all the time. I'd never have guessed that was him.TIL in retirement one ages similar to that of a fruit fly.

That's the first time I've seen him look happy in like 23 yearsJust last night I was watching some old clips of Dave on Youtube.  He was discussing with Jon Stewart how he dislikes shaving.

It appears closer in the photograph than it does in streetview due to the perspective distortion of the telephoto lens used by the original photographer. However, if you look very closely, you can see many of the same landmarks. You can also see the changes/construction made between 2006 (when this photo was uploaded to [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phuentsholing_Bhutan_Indien.jpg)) and 2013. Keep in mind this is an extremely humid climate.

This photograph just happens to be taken under the face of some construction that caused debris to fall into the as-yet-uncovered sewer. The sewer is now covered with concrete slabs, which now serves as a walkway with fencing and doesn't look that bad.

A further exercise would be to examine the nearby streetview on either side of the border. Then you'll see there is not such a disparity as is attempted to be portrayed whenever this photo is posted.They need to do the needful on the India side there. Couple things I noticed, learned, and saw when in India for business. I was in a city, so I can't speak for the rest of the country nor can I speak about rural areas. I did not live there, I only did work and left. And before anybody thinks I'm disrespecting India, I loved my trip and I'd go back.

1) Trash was thrown on street sides. Often people gathered it up and tossed it in large piles in more centralized areas. People rummage through the trash looking for food. Then animals do the same. Whatever is left either stays there or is taken by the poorest of the poor. During the rainy season, this trash often ends up in drainage systems which end up clogged so the streets flood. Then someone is sent in to clean the drains and that person often removes lots of trash and puts it back into the large pile. The cycle continues. While I was there for just under two weeks, three people died cleaning drains.

2) The most wealthy parts of the city look like most ""first world"" cities. They have very new high rise buildings which are well maintained, cleaned, and they employ lots of people doing lots of small jobs. When you have so many people to employ, things that are taken for granted in other places become a job for someone.

3) Everybody knows someone that can be paid to get something done. Here in the US you need licensed contractors to build buildings and you need licensed electricians and plumbers. You need to have a contractor or your utility company come hook up power, phone, sewer, etc. I experienced more pay-offs in my short time in India than I can even believe. Right down to my driver paying off the guards at my hotel to just let us through instead of stopping us every day for bomb checks. While this social system employs lots of people that take a small cut at every level, it's obviously rife with abuse.

4) The resources required to run a single unified nation with over a billion people in it is unfathomable. And since India is what many would consider a developing country, those resources are scarce and badly needed. Imagine trying to provide medical care for a BILLION people, many of whom make the equivalent of a few US dollars a year. Imagine the public works project that would be required to collect, sort, recycle, and properly dispose of trash for a city that has 20-20k people per square kilometer! Just the amount of trash produced is staggering and now you have to pay people to collect it and properly handle it?!


Again, I loved my trip to India and I'd go again in an instant. It really taught me a lot about the world and how I looked at it through the lens of my own daily experience. I saw human beings eating plastic bags for food. I also saw the Taj hotel. I saw things that made me uncomfortable like the tourist traps set up around the Mumbai terror attacks, and I saw beautiful city streets with big box stores and the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen. I think that extreme contrast changed me a bit for the better, but I can say that not every part of India looks like this, but I suspect a lot of the areas not chock full of rich people do.[deleted][California | Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Border_Mexico_USA.jpg)I wish we can see more left side tho but thats quite disturbingLooks like my gfs side of the bed vs mine. Seriously, Bhutan is the shit.

They have a law that says 60 percent of their country must remain forest.

They are a country with less than a million people that sits on the border between China and India, and they have never been invaded by either one.

[deleted]Late to this and is probably going to be buried, but I have lived in Bhutan for approximately 3 years (2002, 2003, various summers) because my father was posted there (Indian Army has many projects in Bhutan). The Bhutanese are very clean, neat and organized people. They are warm and welcoming, but this is the border with West Bengal (Which is a shitty Indian state that other Indians hate too). While a lot of India is dirty, this specific state is known to be the absolute fucking worst. Also what you're looking at is just one aspect.

Caring profession, not giving a shit about stereotypes. Admirable.[deleted]Those are some smoking hot nurses. He did right I would say. Nurse who happens to be male here. In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options. Often you're immediately emasculated. Females look at you as a man doing a historically woman's job which makes them wonder why you're there to begin with. Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience. Now working as a traveller and agency RN, i sometimes work in multiple hospitals a week with all new faces and people to get to know which makes you all the more intriguing to the staffers if you don't suck. I am a female RN but my youngest brother is an LPN. He says his nursing school experience was just terrible and working with 99.9% women is less than ideal for him.I'm a male and I've been an RN for about 7 months now.  Out of taking care of hundreds of patients.. only one has had a problem with a male taking care of them.  All the others had nothing but positive things to say about males being in nursing.  When I starting nursing school I used to be afraid to tell people my major due to the negative stigma.  That stigma does not exist and I am now proud to tell people I am a nurse.  Patients, doctors, and other nurses all treat me with the utmost respect.  I am not a male nurse.

There was a concave viewing window in the big tank, but head on, you could tell.  There was a little girl sitting head-on but a bit far away.  It seemed she didn't notice that she could poke her head into the concavity to look around.

I went up to the window and said, ""Hey, watch this,"" and placed my hand, mime-style, on where she seemed to think the glass was.  And then *pushed.*

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""  And she ran off.

I later saw her frantically pointing at me to who I assumed was her mom as I was leaving.I love how that whole take is supposed to show how those oil rigs provide a great undersea ecosystem.  Fish love Big Oil!They gave us the aquarium so that we dont have to worry about the real ocean anymore. It's also of note that the tank's design and layout are intended to simulate the bottom of an oil rig, so their sponsorship (while certainly eyebrow-raising) DOES sort of make sense.

As a New Orleanian, I know they have the money. I don't like it, but I know it. And I'd rather the kids see it, while the adults roll their eyes at the irony.I thought the same thing when I went there for the first time. 

I always imagined that one day they would put on a kids presentation, showing that there is no way that oil can harm sea life, because water and oil separates. There for, the fist are fine. Or some other BS like that. I was working offshore on a Shell platform when they accidentally pumped 80bbls of Biocide into the Gulf.... ""Oops! My bad....""

After it was all said and done and everything cooled down, AAOA had to buy a new sign. Someone usually stayed by the sign on busier days.

The whole Gulf of Mexico exhibit is geared towards promoting oil companies because to some extent, they actually do help. The right side of the exhibit shows a barren seabed. A few scattered rocks provide minimal cover for small fish, so normally you only see medium to large fish and sharks. On the left side, there's a quarter scale model of an oil rig, which provides hiding spaces for smaller fish which in turn attract even more medium and larger fish. In recent years, reef balls and pipes have been added to show other ways of promoting smaller fish to move in.

Oil rigs, when properly maintained, benefit everyone with perks that are not just about oil. Although making sure you don't spill tons upon tons of oil into the ocean really helps.

Edit: Look, I'm stating this as what they teach their volunteers and how it's presented. This is what they taught me for the years and thousands upon thousands of hours that I worked there and this is the image that AAOA wants to present to the public.

And if you think for one second that I feel that the Horizon disaster was an afterthought, then you have another thing coming. I watched those struggling pelicans with the same sense of hopelessness as I did upon ""the grand pre-open tour"" after Katrina when we basically had nothing alive save for a few animals who could breath air and a couple very stubborn fish. Having gone through nearly a complete aquarium's worth of animals in 2005, if you were there working and if your house had been damaged, you had to develop a very dry sense of humor.

Edit edit: OK, I get it. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was very bad. Y'all act like this didn't effect me, my family, my friends, my workplace, or anything. Please, stop PM'ing me nasty things. Y'all are worse than the lady who thought that penguins were fish and that I couldn't be possibly be right in saying that they were bird and followed me around the rest of the afternoon trying to have a debate to defend her penguin-fish platform.Reminds me of the song Big Yellow Taxi:

*They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum*

*And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them*

*No, no, no*

*Don't it always seem to go*

*That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone*

*They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot*
And that, is, irony!If only we could fit the entire gulf in a tank, just think about all the extra oil we could drill out there in the new desert.Remember when it was sponsored by itself and doing just fine?","[0.934911, 0.192616, 0.318165, 0.053192, 0.050344, 0.049, 0.0, 0.69, 0.265, 0.089, 0.613, 0.595, 0.818]"

Ohio post offfice refused to deliver it because of the smell and made the addressee come pick it up. dead armadillo received. 

a few weeks later my friend, the guy who shipped the dead armadillo, got very ill and was in the hospital for a couple weeks with some kind of stomach infection that descended further into his digestive tract. he had to have part of his intestines removed and was touch and go for a bit in the hospital. Negative comments aside, that is pretty darn cute. Look how happy that kid is with that thing. Don't they eat them and make guitars out of them too?Some armadillos have such strong armor that it can cause bullets to ricochet. Don't believe me? I give you Texans, guns and armadillos!

Really fucking weird movie. Lonely dude pays random actors to pretend to be his family for his birthday. I recommend a watch, if you're fluent in Spanish.Hardly a new idea. Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did something similar on his famous painting 'Las Meninas', in the 17th Century.

The painting depicts the Royal Spanish infanta Margarita Teresa with her maids and other aids, taken from the point of view of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana who are at the same time posing for a portrait that Velázquez himself is depicted painting (left side).

The only clue we have about who is Velázquez painting in this scene is a mirror hanging at the back of the room, where the reflection of the king and queen can be seen.

Who wants a tutorial?

Edit: I'll make a tutorial tomorrow, sorry but it's not a straight forward filter like you're hoping (I was too!). Some people have asked if you just fold the image, that's certainly possible but as you've all seen it creates major artefacts, due to the warping. It's a great place to start though as it helps to establish what you should be aiming for. Those of you familiar with Photoshop this technique is essentially a matte painting especially with more complicated images. 

Basically you don't bend the image, you duplicate, rotate as necessary and then mask the connecting line with any techniques you can. Such as using the clone tool or selecting objects and spreading them across the connecting line to conceal the stitch. Oceans and beaches work well because our eyes are expecting to see repeated patterns which can hide the appearance of repeated sections. 

I'm pretty sure you chaps who are familiar with photoshop will get the idea. I think it does look better than the original because of that slant on the left. And the contrast between the land and the sea makes it even better. Amazing job! This one looks better! Good job!I thought this image looked familiar. I've used it before in my work

The [Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome) is the first domed stadium, and has been sitting unused for about a decade. 

I personally think this is a great idea. Houston is a huge metro area (4th most populous in the country) but lacks a world-class amusement or water park since Six Flags closed. And the summers here can be unbearable, so going indoors is a great idea. Now who's paying for it? That'll be an issue of course.This is not an *old* airship hangar. The building was finished in November 2001. It belonged to a company called CargoLifter that wanted to build freight airships but went bankrupt before any airship was built. They basically only built the hangar and a few hot air balloons for testing.  
  
After that the hangar was re purposed as this waterpark.

[Edit: Looks like it](https://vimeo.com/61845373)This hangar was actually built in 1998, and has nothing to do with the nazis or hindenburg. it was built for an airship project called Cargolifter, which would have been used to transport extremely heavy things into and out of berlin. Before they built the zeppelin they noticed that this could not work, because as soon as the cargo would have been released, the airships high bouyancy ( to lift the several-ton Cargo) would have catapulted the ship up. But the hangar was built anyway. I cannot recommend the park in it, its horrible because there is no sky, and very non-tropical lightingThat middle part could be turned into lazy river. Not really old. It was built in 2000.

One thing to note about this photographer is that he actually dressed up to go to the wedding.

Having been to quite a few weddings now, a shocking amount of photographers turn up dressed like it's a hacky sack tournament on the college lawn. Dear all men (and/or women): take everything out of your suit pockets before the photo session. I am sorry I am not staring at you, I am taking your picture.My best friend is a wedding photographer/videographer, and it's honestly amazing the more I watch how much angles, lens, filter can change a shot. My sisters wedding was outdoors, and it happened to be overcast when it was supposed to be sunny and an unprecedented rain actually moved in later in the evening (damn TX weather), but you couldn't even tell in any of the shots. He made sure all pictures were taken from angles where the little bit of sun was in the background, made amazing use of the natural lighting, and always panned the video to pick up the most natural light etc. It looked so good and made my sister so happy. That guy has a great eye for photography. He's going places!For a split second I thought he was dead and I thought of Rick and Morty :(

I shed a tear hearing that story.My dad owns a ww2 Willys Jeep , they really are amazing machines. We restored it in 2013 and drove from the Netherlands to the Normandy commremorations in June 2014.

https://www.flickr.com/photos/caseyrbrown[deleted][deleted]^^^^Some ^^^^assembly ^^^^requiredHave to wonder if there is a bunch of these sitting in the corner of some Army base warehouse because of long forgotten clerical error. I had a teacher back in high school who was in the Vietnam war.  His job was to blow up bridges so the VC couldn't follow them or use the bridges to resupply.   Well, this meant he pretty much spent most of his time hanging around ""bases"" which were no more than commandeered villages.  One day, he takes bricks that were just sitting around and made a gigantic barbecue pit.  A villager had given him a pig for some reason or another, so he decided to throw a gigantic party for everyone stationed in that village, as well as any villagers that wanted to come.  Not surprisingly, he got into huge trouble, and was removed from the village and stationed in the worst, most degrading job there was.  They made him guard a junk yard in the middle of the jungle.  It was mostly jeeps exactly like this one.

Well, as you can see from the picture, these Jeeps mostly just bolt together. So 12 hours a day with nothing to do, his boredom got the best of him, so he started bolting these pieces together from various junked Jeeps to see if he could make a functioning Jeep.   He said he got about 90% there. The only thing he couldn't do with the parts he had was functioning brakes.  So he did the best he could, he bolted a gigantic pole to the side of the jeep that he could shove into the tire and pull as hard as he could to slow the jeep down.

He ended up driving the jeep around that little area for his remaining time in Vietnam, sometimes even driving around officers and other dignitaries, no one even questioned whether he was supposed to have a Jeep or why he had to use a gigantic pole to stop.The ultimate example of ""its worth more in the box"". http://imgur.com/a/5ZgEX

Army vet here, I was stationed in South Korea back in the early 80's. I worked at the base HQ but was all enlisted were required to pull motor pool duty one week a month. I reported ""as ordered"" to the Motor pool non-com and was assigned the duty of tearing down and repacking two Korean War era jeeps. They looked very much like the picture. They crates had a jeep size fold-out cloth with actual sized spots for each individual parts with pictographs of where to find the part on a jeep and how to remove them. The entire process could be done without reading any words. It took me ten days to complete the job. It was a most satisfying task.
Fragiiiillllle.Does it include an allen wrench or what?Are these the ""jeep kits"" that where offered for sale for $450.00 in the back of old magazines? First thing I thought ""Some assembly required"" I kinda wish that I could get a modern car shipped to me like this.  It would be fun to have to put it together before you use it.  Like the adult version of Legos!

**Edit:** I completely forgot about kit cars!  So I guess this still is a thing.They did this with larger vehicles too, I have a M35A2 and they were designed to ship in crates as well.  The tops disassemble with simple tools, windshield folds town and the highest point on the vehicle is the top of the steering wheel.I believe they were a lot more effective after they replaced the square wooden wheels with round rubber onesJ.ust

Hitting all the red lights. So frustrating. He's jerking around corners, hitting the gas pedal like it personally screwed up his order, just generally driving with as much huff as an annoyed middle-aged, middle-class guy can.

At one light, a lowrider pulls up next to him, blasting the bass, bunch of rowdy young dudes out being noisy. They start yelling at my dad, kind of laughing at him, ""Hey man! Hey!""

My dad is in no mood to get into some street race with a bunch of yahoos or whatever they want. He ignores them and continues on, but they follow him, honking at him, meet at the next light, ""Yo man! Heyyy!""

Finally he's like ""WHAT?!"" 

""Hey man, you got a cat on your car, man!""

Poor kitty was clinging on for dear life and of course as soon as he pulled into the nearest parking lot, it shot off into the bushes to kiss solid ground. 

The lowrider followed my dad into the lot and all five young guys piled out and spent the next 10 minutes shaking bushes, crawling around, making kissy noises, and helped my dad catch the cat. Once they caught the cat they told it: ""no more car surfing, man!"" I like to think he's making [this](https://i.imgur.com/4XiFgJp.gifv) face as he clings on.

He continued running across campus and everyone who had been staking me out ran after him.  
&nbsp;  
I waited two minutes and then walked quietly back to my dorm.I was in a dorm where there was a girl who looked just like me, dressed like me, and even had the same major. 

She even walked and talked like me. It was rather unreal. Our names sounded similar, just one letter off, so people would call out to her and I'd respond, and vice versa.

My mother was visiting me once and I went to take a shower. At around the same time, my doppelganger got done with hers and began walking to her room. My mother saw what she thought was me going somewhere not my room and called out to me and she answered. I came out to see both of them talking and my first reaction was 'mom, that's not me!'

We've stayed in touch and she's now a researcher in the same area as I am. When I was quitting my earlier job, I referred her to that team and she got hired. My old colleagues say it's like I never left.

Edit: I saw her parents at graduation. They look nothing like mine, though the resemblance to her is clear. I'm also the spitting image of my mom except for my father's jawline, so I'm not adopted either. That made it genuinely cool for me.I read ""10 years ago I went off to college"" and thought, man, you must be old.

Then I realized that I started college 11 years ago. 

:lI am a neuroscientist. In biology/medicine, we use [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to find articles, and authors are listed as ""LastName, FirstInitial SecondInitial"". I'm listed as Thompson CK. And since Thompson is such a common name, I'm not the only Thompson CK. In fact, there is another Thompson CK publishing in neuroscience, and occasionally I get emails for him, because his name is Christopher K Thompson, my exact name. 

Every year, there is one big neuroscience conference with 35,000+ attendees, and last year I emailed him to see if we can meet up. He comes to my poster, and I am just shocked at how similar her looks to me! I have two brothers, and he looks a lot more like me than either of them! Even more, he also happened to grow up in a town about 8 miles from my hometown. We both have degrees from the University of Illinois. We both really like pizza and beer. I mean, what are the chances...

Here is a [pic.](http://i.imgur.com/yoLulp0.jpg) I'm on the left. Funny enough, I had shaved my beard about 3 months prior to this pic being taken. If I'd left it on, we'd almost be twins.

And I never forget faces. Eventually I was like ""No, I never met you!""

And the response was ""Yeah, we met earlier, you are Sean from Baltimore"". And I was from Baltimore.

Turns out, there was another Sean from Baltimore staying at the hostel and meeting loads of people. 

Yeah, and he looked *exactly* like me. When we ran into each other in the hallway I instantly knew this was the dude. He looked at me the exact same way since he had been dealing with the same issue since we were both very outgoing people.

We talked for about 3 seconds and then both ran in different directions. I guess we were both freaked the fuck out that we were both Sean from Baltimore, short hair, same facial structure, same clothing style, same height, same build, same social personality...

Hopefully all these new links hold after DropBox crapped out.Wiki on the Greater Tokyo area http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area 

More people live here than the countries of Canada and Iraq [Reminds me of this picture of Mexico City](http://i.imgur.com/FPO3S59.jpg)I visited Tokyo once, and one thing that stuck with me was how I've read a lot of science fiction that I thought was original, but no, it's just describing Tokyo.  Pretty much everything that's written about a giant city-like planet is really Tokyo inspired.

It definitely made me think about how there are surely some people who have never left that city in their lives, and just what you imagine the rest of the world to be like if you're one of those people.No wonder it's taken Godzilla so long to destroy it.It kind of looks like a sci-fi concept of a planet-wide city.For perspective, [this is the greater Tokyo area superimposed onto the United Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/Eqfme.jpg)See that EA? This is what Sim City should be about. Let me build (or at least plan and manage) THIS. 

What's so hard about it?  I just essentially need Sim City 3000 on today's hardware. No real 3D is even needed.I live in Tokyo... this is just one direction... If you go to to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building, Mori tower, or Tokyo Sky Tree on a clear day, you just see... cement as far as the eye can see. You'll see Kawasaki connect to Yokohama, and then it just fades into the distance. Then you'll see Chiba and Saitama (which we consider the sticks) wall-to-wall with buildings. Then you'll see all the way to Takao-san with nothing but buildings until you get right to the foot of the mountain. It's absolutely insane...

At night it is breathtaking, though.

http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-gigapixel-roppongi-hills-mori-tower/#0.00,0.00,90.0Definitely not as big as Tokyo, but [São Paulo](http://static.theglobalmail.org/cache/37/13/3713345cd59dc2ed9ec915e33f3e5c96.jpg) is also worthy of consideration.Neo-Tokyo is biggerTokyo is literally the population of Canada, in one city. It took me 8 days to drive across CanadaWorst city to survive a zombie apocalypse in.[Google Maps 3D view from roughly the same position](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Tokyo,+Japan/@35.6490331,139.533142,3087a,20y,79.5h,74.73t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x605d1b87f02e57e7:0x2e01618b22571b89?hl=en)

From this it's easy to find the big landmarks. 

Shinjuku is group of skyscrapers on the left side in the middle, which is said to have the busiest subway station in the world. At the right side of the big green park you find Shibuya, you know the shopping district with the [worlds busiest street crossing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2685/4458168800_2727610646_b.jpg),  and the cluster of ""dark"" skyscrapers, guess they are just being shadowed by a cloud, is just beyond the imperial palace and gardens. 



It is in fact the only city large enough for my mother.  When I was visiting Tokyo I thought I would go out to the bar one night. I never thought about the fact that the trains might stop running at some point. So when I came out of the club at 2-3am, I realized I had to walk back to my hotel. Five hours later, after walking in a straight line, I got there. ### it's a **MEGALOPOLIS!** I think I made something like this in SimCity once. The city barely lasted a week. That traffic must be a blast to drive in I like that one green spot. Like that. That is where I shall live!Awesome shot. It always blows my mind when I see non-US cities (as an American). I think Chicago or Charlotte or LA are huge, but they don't hold a candle to the size of some foreign cities. 

EDIT: 

Been getting some responses that seem to be questioning my inclusion of Charlotte. Please note that I included it because not only do I live here and love this city but I figured size-wise it is about the same as a lot of other American cities with the exception of the big three and would make a good reference point when comparing to non-American cities. 

Here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown:

I went to Tokyo a few years back and it was absolutely amazing.  I was in Shinjuku and it was so nice and clean and beautiful.  I've been to NYC numerous times and it was so dirty, the streets were disgusting, tons of homeless people, just total noise pollution from cars hoking etc.  During my stay in Tokyo, over i think it was 4 days, I heard a total of 3 car honks.  3 Car honks in 4 days.  I can hear 3 car honks in 3 seconds in New York City.  So many international cities just outclass NYC, yet apparently NYC is a pride of our country.  Joe Biden's comments about LaGuardia airport a while back is really a microcosm of NYC as a whole, it's dirty, disgusting, and inefficient.

How do the waffles taste with home-field advantage?Belgian here. The sugared waffle and strawberry combo you'll be able to find at pretty much every local market. Most will have a waffle stand.

Places to see when visiting:

* Ypres and the entirety of the 'Westhoek' especially nowadays with the 100 year anniversary of WW1. There are plenty of memorial sites here so you might even find a family member. Well preserved remnants of trenches, and some very nice museums.

* While you're in this area the coast isn't too long of a drive. It's a huge tourist trap but if you want try Belgian mussels then you'll find the best on the coast. All sorts of freshly caught fish and seafood can be bought on the dike at around 4-5 pm in the afternoon, when the boats come back in.

* Some of our cities have a very rich history. Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp for example were economical powerhouses in the medieval times and you still get to visit old guild houses and the like. Tongeren on the other hand is the oldest Belgian city and dates back to Roman times. Tongeren has a nice Gallo-Roman museum that sheds light on both cultures living together and merging within Belgian borders.

Local cuisine to try out. Most of it has a very countryside and homely feel to it.

* 'French' fries. Really, these things are Belgian and every town will have at least a few 'frietkoten', places that specialize in only selling French fries and other deep-fried stuff that goes with it. I recommend asking the locals for a good place. It's tough to find a place that sucks but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference in quality.

* Chocolate. If you find a chocolate shop you should definitely go and buy some real Belgian pralines. High price, but worth experiencing.

* Mussels. Best place to order this is obviously the coast, so you're guaranteed they're as fresh as can be. Most often served with fries, a bit of mayonnaise, and a special sauce just for the mussels. The mussels are basically cooked in a stewy vegetable soup with lots of spices. Shrimp are also a very loved local seafood.

* Beef carbonnade, locally known as 'stoofvlees'. I personally dislike it but most Belgians freaking love it. The sauce is often prepared with some heavy beer like a Trappiste or Tripel.

* On that note, the beer. There's a huge variety here. Some people love Jupiler, others the heavier Duvel. We have all sorts of white, blonde, and dark beers as well as fruity 'chick' beers. I'm not much of a beer guy myself but I fucking love a cold Stella Artois. Some places especially in the city will specialize in serving as many different beers as possible and they'll even serve them in the correct glass. Worth asking around if there's such a place where you're visiting. You can drink an afternoon away just exploring tastes if you're not careful.

* Other stuff I can't be bothered to describe anymore: *waterzooi, paling in't groen, pensen, ...*

* My personal favourite: *kiekerenbloed*, literally chicken's blood, which is exactly the main ingredient. It's a *very* local dish that's made by (as far as I know) mixing chicken's blood with bacon grease and baking it, then serving it with a sandwich and a dollop of mustard. [Some gentlemen enjoying a pint and a plate of kiekerenbloed.](http://i.imgur.com/ZO3UeHm.jpg)Fucking Bruges.Someday I'd like to retire to Belgium and live entirely on waffles and fries.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/vanished.shtmlFour years ago I spent a couple days in the Dolomites at Passo Brocon in northern Italy. I took a long day hike up the mountains above the hotel and found a WW1 gunnery nest. It was mid-September and already pretty damn cool up there. I jumped inside the nest and looked around. The soldiers had a nice view of the area, but they were also totally exposed. The wind whipped over the little hilltop. Then came a sudden thunderstorm. I had nowhere to hide and got completely soaked. As I high-tailed it down the mountain to my hotel, I thought about those soldiers who were stuck in that nest in winter. Holy shit, that would have SUCKED. 

I got hot coffee and drove the 17 miles to town to get new shoes (mine were muddy and filthy). Those soldiers couldn't. They were stuck in the frozen mud for weeks at a time. And now some of them are unearthing. >the remains of two Austrian soldiers found on the Presena Glacier in 2012. Photo: Office for Archaeological Finds, Autonomous Province of Trento

So... Can these corpses be viral carriers?Imagine that being you. Just dead, nobody knowing for sure whether you died or just never returned, nobody knowing how you died or where you were; and when your body *is* finally discovered, anybody who would've cared is dead now too.It's kind of crazy that when that guy woke up that morning he had no idea he would be killed and begin a 100 year journey through a glacier that would end in 2015 where his picture would be posted across the world for people to look at on their phones, computers, at the bus station, a restaurant, or even sitting on the toilet. I bet he would have stayed in bed had he known that. Captain Italia looks like he needs a little time to readjust They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and terrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Otto von Bismarck had ""ended"" (after a hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army to aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir of Bismarck. And my hunt for Captain America has just made a little bit more progress. Just imagine that was probably some poor woman's husband that she never heard from again...Grim? Check. 
Frost bitten? Check.
Death? Absolutely.

This content is black metal certified. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.If they were frozen in glaciers, why are they not better preserved?Now that's what I call Italian ice.Draugr de Italiana.If anyone is interested in WWI, there's an awesome channel on YouTube that has been doing videos on what happened that week 100 years ago.

Goede actie.Just an FYI to the folks who are confused about hypoglycemia...most likely this woman has diabetes, probably Type I which is insulin dependent. Anyone who has this knows what a royal pain in the rear it is...constantly checking your blood sugar, adjusting your food intake, insulin intake, activity level to attempt to simulate a non-diabetic's blood sugar. Even with constant vigilance, your blood sugars can dip low or go high, for sometimes unknown reasons (is this infusion set on my insulin pump blocked? I worked a little harder raking the leaves and didn't eat enough...I have a cold, maybe that's why my glucose is high? Etc). Managing the disease is a total balancing act. This mom prob went into hypoglycemia because it was dinner time and she was going to eat soon but her blood sugar dropped too low before she got a chance to eat,and she got confused or was behaving abnormally or became unresponsive. Scary stuff. I am glad the police helped her out like they did. Serious respect for these guys. They're the model that all policeman should follow.

Also I hope at least one of them is single.And these are the guys that had to fight and go on strike to get a better CAO (collective agreement), incomprehensible. Goeie jongens.Most of redditors are from Netherlands.I was reading this thinking ""Woah! This is totally unheard of!   ... Oh, Netherlands, well then it makes sense""

Edit: I was just expressing my initial reaction to reading this. You're all right of course, that there are plenty of American police with good intentions, and it gets drowned out by either bad cops or just that it's hard to be nice when you're surrounded by gang violence...  FTP - Fix The Police ... And also inner-city/organized crimeIf this had happened in the United States the woman would have hired a lawyer and sued the cops, their department, and the city.  Well when the crime rate is so low you don't have a couple dozen report/complaint calls stacked up to go to after the current one (not to mention whenever high priority calls come in in-between) you've got time to cook dinner and do dishes. 

 Personally, I think the good cops (not the minority haring trigger happy ones) would have a much better time at ""community relations"" if they were better staffed or crime was lower.  This is probably why old people remember friendly cops who they got to know and such. Those cops has fewer calls and more time to reach out.Tijd om 112 te bellen! Ik ruik m'n afwas vanaf hier...Not gunna lie, hypoglycemia is a bitch. I lived in Eindhoven for a while and can honestly say it's one of my favourite places, if only because everyone seemed so nice and welcoming.

My aunt from overseas sent a book on endangered species.  I thought it was a brilliant gift for a time capsule.

Yes, there is roughly 100 left in other countries. But the minimum viable population for any species is generally between 50-150. That means this species is extremely close to being doomed to die out. I'm not associated with the WWF or any related organisations, and I would encourage anyone to do their own research before donating, but I hope at least one person will consider it. It should be changed to extirpated.

There are still more Sumatran rhinos in Sumatra and Borneo.

And you'd think reddit hates China or something. Sumatran rhinos aren't often poached. And even if they are, Chinese people don't typically make viagras out of rhino's ivory.I'm just surprised the little guy has hair.Fuck humansJust to clarify why rhinos (in general) are going extinct, and why it will happen so quickly: Of course, one of the larger factors is poaching, and is probably one of the easiest for you all to donate towards. Because of this poaching, scientists have essentially been forced to breed rhinos in a way that does not promote genetic diversity (we don't want to say that they are essentially inbred, but they are almost clones of each other). Because of the lack of genetic variance, any small thing (diseases, disruption in food source, geographic dislocation, etc.) will pretty much wipe them off the face of the earth. 

Also, in case you didn't know, cheetahs are in the same boat. Although their numbers in the wild are relatively large at the moment, any small disease could wipe out wild cheetahs in the next year.One day in the future kids are going to find it hard to believe that animals once lived in the wild and that the wild used to consist of something more than a fucking Walmart parking lot. Just so some rich dudes in China can try to get their dicks hard.http://news.discovery.com/animals/endangered-species/sumatran-rhinos-now-extinct-in-malaysia-150820.htm

Dafoe has a certain kind of crazy look that befits Two Face's identity crisis a lot better. He pulled it off well with Green Goblin and a more comic-version of Two Face (who acts a bit different from movies and games) would suit Dafoe really well, I think.

He could probably do Joker crazy just fine too, but I think Two Face would end up coming out better.Simple, his dick is too big.Already been the Green Goblin.Easy - he doesn't want his ass kicked.

He'd be waaay too convincing and the next thing you know, the real Batman is showing up at his place throwing elbows and grunting all throatily. How about for a Batman Beyond movie?He can't be.

We can still tip but the tip jar is near the register and probably need to ask for it.

The incentive for good service is not getting your ass fired while someone else takes you reasonably paying job.Wow, this thread is amazing-- thanks for the attention, everyone!  My little restaurant is flattered.  Just wanted to give you guys (and particularly the servers/ cooks/ restaurant owners out there) more details on what we're doing and how we do it!

First, it's not simply an increased hourly wage!  In addition to fully funded benefits for EVERY employee, full or part time, and $15/ hour, they all get a portion of the sales.  Waitstaff get 12% of their individual sales (remember, servers used to tip out 6% of their sales, so that's like a guaranteed 18% from every table, including takeout.)  Kitchen & support staff get a percentage of the shift's sales, depending on their roles. 

It's removed the judgement, assumptions, and emotions that living off tips entailed; my servers love that.  And of course I don't take any cash they DO receive; if they do so well that someone wants to reward them extra, more power to them, that's theirs to keep.  And it happens... because my staff is incredible :)  

Come visit us in San Francisco sometime!Reddit loves a great tipping thread, but what this restaurant is saying is that ALL of their staff (bussers, dishwashers, cooks &amp; servers) are paid a living wage.  Kudos.

Serving is tough, but the kitchen is just as valuable to the dining experience. The restaurant that I work at pays minimum wage, we get tipped, but we also get profit sharing. We also get fully funded health, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) with employer match and discounts to climbing gyms and other places to boot. 

I enjoy working there.Are there any servers here that wouldn't be okay with this? My friend is a server and she says she regular makes $20+ / hour when you average her tips, and closer to $30 if she does that thing that absolutely no servers do - not reporting their tips to the IRS. That is a sweet benefits package I must say, but she's told me she'd quit serving if she ever averaged less than $20 / hr.Picture of a menu. I like the Italian way: no obligation, no forced tips, no shared jar. You liked the service exceptionally? Leave some extra money on the table when you leave. Your waiter will take it completely for himself.Redditor: ""Instead of a tip I have left you with this informative card which expains how the tip system exploits the lower class."" <tips fedora> ""M'lady.""So basically it's like how restaurants work in the entire rest of the world. USA takes another step forward!I hate the tip system in the U.S. 

As a black person, whenever I go to a restaurant, they think I won't tip, so they give me poor service. This leads me to want to tip poorly, but I still always give at least 15%. 

I wish tip wasn't part of it and it was just a fixed price.Sounds better than 

**35% Tip included in Menu Prices**so 20% markups are already included in the prices.I just went here! Really good. Really french waitress. That's OK. I'll take my tipping position which averages me around 30-35/hr.Move to Europe LOL Zazie is in SF. They're required by law to provide health insurance. It's also a California law to provide Paid Sick Leave. ""Living Wage,"" which is how much exactly? Because SF is fucking expensive and their poverty wage would go pretty far in Sacramento. I know I'm in the minority here, but I *like* the practice of tipping. It's one of the few times where I can, unilaterally, decide the value of a good or service **after** getting it. 

At the couple of restaurants where I show up at fairly regularly, I always get excellent service, they remember what I like, and treat me like I'm a valued customer. And I'm not by any means rich nor do I tip more than a pretty typical amount. 

I'd actually be disappointed to have tipping taken out of the equation in a lot of places. Define living wage...This is actually a great restaurant too. Good food, nice wine, neat ambiance. I've taken a few dates here. It's a nice spot if you find yourself in Cole Valley, SF. I'm glad we don't have tipping where I live.The fact remains that, at a flat daily wage, a busy day is worse for a waiter than a slow day.

The tip system, with all its flaws, does achieve one thing. It makes wait staff *want* the place to be bustling. It puts management and employees on the same page, keeping the place as busy as possible is how everybody gets their payday. 

When a waiter gets tips, they see a large party coming through the door and they get excited. When they don't, they see a large party coming through the door and they sigh. More work, same pay.As a hospitality worker in SF, this is as outrageous as it is hilarious.  They pay their employees $15 an hour, sounds like a lot for other parts of the country, but keep in mind that is set to be our *minimum* wage by 2017 (current minimum wage is $12.25).  Saying that is a livable wage for a restaurant in the Bay Area, nevertheless in SF itself is simply not true.  The total cost of living in San Francisco is 62.6% higher than the U.S. average, and we have the most brutal real estate/rent situation in the country right now (http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2015/06/02/san-franciscos-median-rent-hits-a-ridiculous-4225/)
A tipped position in the Bay Area allows you to make double or more than what they are paying.  Also, while I encourage them to let people know they are providing benefits and doing what ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY, but specifically discouraging any extra gratuities is silly and will hurt service in the long run.  They will lose real talent because competent and hospital servers/bartenders that go above and beyond will leave because working here is basically getting payed what you would at McDonalds.Tipping culture always confused me when I was younger and I used to visit the US a lot, having grown up in England. Here its basically set up as mentioned in the sign and the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour (although it's set to increase to £9.00 an hour) plus the government will pitch in quite generously in terms of benefits if you're stuck on minimum wage (but waiting staff normally are not, depending on the establishment). Saves a whole lot of hassle when paying though... And if you want to tip on top of that you can: for exemplary service.","[0.956596, 0.05457, 0.049403, 0.060894, 0.05259, 0.37, 0.081, 0.0, 0.222, 0.173, 0.599, 0.624, 0.788]"

Link related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter

Also, I heard a story of a student who was in a class where the teacher allowed students to only write on one side of a sheet. He twisted the sheet and attached it to itself as a Möbius strip.I always loved note-card allowed exams. I thought I was getting one over on the teacher (Hah! I wrote suuuuper small, take that!) but I always ended up learning more of the material because I actually spent time studying by putting together my card.I had a classmate in high school peel the index card apart into layers and then print off typed notes to paste on each layer. The kid ended up with like 5 extra sides on his notes. The teacher was so astounded that a 16 year old would think of this that he allowed the kid to use the note card.  From then on out, that teacher clearly stated that this isn't allowed. Talk about interpretating the rules haha.

PS: Forgive my grammar mishaps (I know its interpreting), as the drunken redneck within me came out last night.My Differential Equations professor always used to say, you may use one piece of paper. If you are creative enough, you can use all 6 sides.When they wear them on each eye the answers pop out in 3DThis kid is going placesWhy the hell aren't they printing a 3x5 notecard in 3 point fonts and bringing reading glasses?Story time:

There was a legend in the math department at my college that a professor allowed students to use an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper full of notes for the final exam.  The only problem was that the prof didn't specify units of measurement so some smart-ass (or possibly genius) student got a hold of a sheet of butcher paper that was 8 1/2 FEET by 11 FEET.  Since the prof hadn't specified units of measurement, he ended up letting the kid use it, but from then on he always made sure to say that an 8 1/2 INCH by 11 INCH sheet of paper could be used for notes on the final.

I will say that your student's method of bending the rules is far more creative and less smartassy than the student in my story.I did something similar, except for a multivariable calculus final. We were allowed both sides of a 5"" × 7"" notecard. So I wrote out my notes first horizontally on the card, then turned the card 90° and wrote in a different color on both sides again.
So long as you use colors that are markedly different and not too dark, it works well.So that kid gets an A for being a genius right?The thing I remember most about these notecard style exams is that most of the stuff I wrote down I ended up remembering just from the act of taking the time to write it.  I ended up just using the card to double-check stuff so I didn't feel I made it in vain.Where was this post a couple days ago? I could have used this on my final.I had a teacher specifically forbid this because she had seen it before. Playing with legos all the time (and hunting for the right color part in a mixed bin) as a kid developed in me the ability to ""blur out"" all colors but the one I'm looking for. I have done this with six colors and no lenses.

""A"" for creativity, but abject failure for the crime of NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. My teachers in college said that we could use our books during the exam. Whenever that happened, everyone realized that the exam was going to be so hard that the books wouldn't even be helpful. Sadly to say, this was indeed the case.A teacher once told my class to ""only use a 3 by 5 note card."" My best friend came in with a huge piece of paper made of other papers taped together with most the chapter written on it. The teacher asked what he thought he was doing so my friend explained that she never specified 3 by 5 inches and that his paper was 3 by 5 feet. He said it was still 3 by 5 so he was still following the rules. She let him get away with it but never forgot to say inches after that.","[0.826095, 0.938878, 0.783487, 0.041794, 0.31355, 0.208, 0.106, 0.0, 0.402, 0.254, 0.404, 0.6, 0.713]"

You can (and people do) climb all over the stones. 

I spent the night at Stonehenge for summer solstice 7 years ago. There were some Druid rituals - I remember a parade with flaming torches and giant furry animal heads - but mostly people were just there to party. There were drum circles everywhere, some food vendors, and lots of drinking and smoking. 

Unfortunately, it drizzled the whole time, so we didn't get to see the sunrise through the stones. But I was glad the weather forced me to wear wellies, because man, those porta potties grew increasingly biohazardous as the night wore on. Edit to change my opinion. Apparently they trash it every year and it's kinda sad. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11455098/Stonehenge-damaged-with-chewing-gum-and-graffiti-during-Winter-Solstice.htmlMy dad said that when he was a kid in the 60's, stonehenge was just this random thing off the highway, with one tiny little sign, and you just parked on the highway shoulder and walked over to it.  You could climb on it, there was some small graffiti on it, and nobody cared, because there was nobody there.

We went again as a family in 2006, and you had to park in a parking lot far away, pay an entry fee, walk through this long underground tunnel that took you underneath the highway with a bunch of infographics on the walls, then you come to stonehenge and it's all roped off with velvet and you just slowly walk around it in a circle with the group, stopping occasionally to take pictures.They left that place in ruins.This is why we can't have nice things.

What a bunch of fucking arseholes.Funny, they didn't look Druish.As a janitor, I'm impressed. After that many people this looks pretty tame. Is no one in this thread able to realise that most of the 23,000 aren't hippies and are just party-goers?also, plenty of other people. I mean, if you've got 23,000 people, some subset of them are gonna be assholes no matter what.

You could probably make this title 23,000 gamers, white people and self-stylied atheists and be equally as accurate.*Shocking* that a group of 23k people left trash on the ground. 20k out of the 23k could have cleaned up all their mess and you're still left with the mess of 3k people. >Claims to celebrate and respect the earth

>Leaves a bunch of paper/petrol-based garbage at an ancient Druid heritage site.http://i.imgur.com/tNx7nB4.gifI went to Stonehenge a few years ago and they had a rope fence up about a hundred feet from the stones because people vandalized the stones. 
then people do shit like this, nothing pisses me off more than seeing a place people hold sacred trashed by 23k of the absolute scum of society. I think most of them aren't really hippies or druids, just people who like a party.Gotta love that Hipster hypocrisy ;) ""But man, we love mother earth! She is so beautiful, lets throw our trash all over it.""

You've missed the photo where loads of people stayed behind to clear up. This is disgusting.If anyone's ever been they'll know it's mainly populated by local chavs looking for an excuse to get wrecked. Not trying to defend their actions here but I bet if you put a group of 23000 of anybody it would look the same.I was there for the whole event and I can tell you there were people from all social circles. There were plenty of new-agers and hippies but they were heavily outnumbered by the general public.

The event is part of a religious holiday that's open to anyone and although there were volunteers picking litter, you have to expect some debris from 23,000 people moving in and around the stones.

Otherwise it was an absolutely electric night, people chanting, playing bongos and dancing around the circle into the early hours was amazing to see. I even saw a guy playing a saxophone to one of the stones.I was there

I am there every year

Loads of local chavs and non hippies turn up to get fucked up and ruin the vibe. Don't blame the hippies because we make up less than half of the people there - after the sunrise all the non-hippies leave and then you'll see what the summer solstice celebrators are really like!I was there at the 2015 summer Solstice, I was there with my friends just to see what all the hype was about. And as far as I could tell the people doing all the damage was not the druids and people there for the religous ceremony but the people who  were there to get smashed and take drugs in a field. It was basically like Reading Festival Campsite, and if anyone has ever seen a festival campsite after the festival has finished it looks exactly like this.Japanese druids would never let this happen.

These magazines are to women with low self esteem what Archie digests are to children: Recycled good feelings.* Lose weight by doing nothing

* Lose more weight from sex

* Eat everything and never get fatFun fact, despite being founded 24 years earlier, *Shape* has a circulation that's equal to *Women's Health.*Makes sense. Bikini season happens every year. People always want to be in better shape, even if they aren't willing to work for it. The thing that always perplexed me about these ""women's magazines"" (and Woman's World is probably the most guilty of this): Almost every single issue, there are two big things on the cover: ""Make these delicious treats!"" and ""Tricks / Diets to lose weight fast!""

Seriously, take a look the next time you're in the store. 99% of the time you'll find the cover of Woman's World has both of those. It's so absurd.Magazine aimed at single woman: Get skinny fast!  How to get him off!

Magazine aimed at married woman: Bake this incredibly unhealthy cake!  How to lose 20 lbs!
Marketer here.

You aren't their target audience. 

These magazines do TONS of market research or ""testing"" behind the scenes. They interview dozens upon dozens of people behind closed doors and ask them random questions. A lot of the answers given may seem bullshit to us, but market research is about picking up on the ""language"" that your target audience uses today. Hence, you see a difference in the way weight loss is described in the latter version. Same thing, but their target audience now describes their pain points in a different lingo. 

I bet this magazine conducted hundreds of interviews and picked up on pain points, the way their readers think and talk, how they describe situations, etc before they even released this cover.

It's actually SUPER easy to conduct market/customer/user research now. In the past, companies had to do in person interviews and focus groups in order to understand their target audience. That would take WEEKS to organize and conduct... Super slow process and quite frankly, dreadful. Now they go to companies like UserTesting and launch a quick, remote test and within 20 minutes have all the research they need. 

Crazy world we live in!

During this period of their lifespan, they do not have mouths, as a result do not eat, and exist solely to procreate.This obviously was staged by the moths for the sake of bankrupting the butterflies.

Otherwise that thing is going to last 5-10 years tops.What exactly is used to hold the rocks in place...a certain kind of cement?In the boy scouts, they would warn us against using river rocks for our fire pit.

It really overwhelms the house instead of fitting in and seeming like a part of it. Same thing but smaller would have been perfect.ITT: People who know about river rocks but not about fireplace/chimney construction. River rock is often used for fireplace surrounds and is easily found at many local landscape and decor specialty stores. The stones are not used directly in the fireplace where the heat is the highest. In addition, many stones are properly dried before being sold. 

They aren't wrong saying you shouldn't use river rock when making a camping fire. But, in this application, river rocks are completely fine and make for an aesthetically pleasing fireplace. It doesn't really matter what kind of stone it is as far as resisting heat.

Unless this was built some place that is completely wild west as far as building codes, this isn't a chimney and fireplace that is solely stone. There is a fireplace made out of fire brick and a specific heat resistant mortar. 

That feeds up into a smoke shelf which will be masonary and on top of that will be clay liners, wrapped in four inch block all the way up. There will also be four inch block providing the rectangular shape to lay the stone up to.

To sum it up: There is a clay liner that's an inch or more thick, a four inch block, at least an inch or two of space, then the four inch block exterior shell, another inch or two between the shell and the stone.

These stone are at least almost a foot away (with close to nine inches of heat resistant material in between) from any of that heat being produced in the fireplace and moving up and out through the chimney.and now there is a river with no rocks I admire the amount of technical skill and time put into this, but I think it looks really tacky. Nice idea, but the design make nauseous. I need order, sorry.Former mason laborer here - by far the funnest job I worked on was a huge entire house of irregular stone like this.  Basically it was a 2-month-long scavenger hunt, running from skid to skid looking for the right stone for the right spot.  Took longer and the rocks were harder to lift, but man it was a nice break from the monotony of brick-work.  And looked awesome when we were done!Nope. Sorry but it reminds me of the picture of the ticks in a dog's ear. I can't unsee that picture when I look at this chimney. I saw a picture once of a deer with hundreds of ticks in a group stuck to it and it looks like this fire placelooks amazing but how long do these actually last? the mortar will give way to weather and the rocks will fall out of place eventuallyi wonder what there is to stop rain from just falling right down and into your house.Looks like a hidden environmental puzzle from The Witness.These curves bother me.

This is adorable.

I just hope he doesn't suffer any extreme health issues.Somebody call John Green! Little known fact, if you feed elephants lots of cheese that slows down their metabolism slightly and can, in very extreme cases, lead to dwarfism. The cheese can do this due to the way the enzymes in the cheese react with the elephants special type of stomach acid.

Volcanos, you crazy. Unedited? I can tell you with full confidence as a photographer/photo editor that the color saturation on the aid workers was increased and the rest decreased to add a more dramatic effect. You can even see little bits of brown around the photo that were left to make it seem unedited but seem oddly out of place. Examples are the headless statue and surrounding area, materiel hanging out the window, little spot of brown on the far right down slope.

http://imgur.com/PLdA307Brooklyn Supreme is NOT the world's biggest horse!

The ""biggest"" horse on record is Sampson, a Shire horse 21.2 hands high by the time he was a four year old, when he was re-named Mammoth. His peak weight was estimated at 3,360 lb.  He was born in 1846, before Brooklyn was ever born.

Brooklyn ""only"" stood 19.2 hands high.  

The record-holder for ""biggest horse"" as of 2007 was a Shire horse named Tina who was 20 hands high.  Tina died in 2008 and was subsequently beaten by Big Jake, who is 20 hands *plus two and three-quarter inches* and still alive, holding the current record.  Big Jake weighs only 2,600 pounds compared to Sampson, but Guinness no longer records ""biggest"" by weight, but by height, so although Jake is much trimmer than either Brooklyn or Sampson, he still holds the title.

Edit: a ""hand"" is 4 inches.
That horse never skipped leg day. Or any day.Beautiful horse, horrible feet. His toe is so long, Id imagine he had a hard time moving especially considering his massive size. Imagine trying to walk with swimming flippers on your feet all day long!When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

Someone educate me... what are the balloon-looking things?  Or are they bombs?  My Dad is somewhere in there. My grandfather was a medic on D-day. He dragged wounded and dead soldiers to the beach and loaded them onto medic boats. I'm going to see him in an hour and I didn't realize what today is until I saw this post. Thank you for reminding me to thank him. Probably the most insane logistical and engineering undertaking in history.an interesting thing about d day is the germans blew up all the docks and the allies anticipated this and build a floating dock that they could boat up to the beach which then served as a unloading point for all their shit... and the germans blew up their shit and the allies sailed their dock in and everything went way easier for the unloading process... it was called mulberry and when i saw this on the history channel the guy said it was one of the most innovative things about the invasionImagine what that must have *sounded* like.Might get buried, but I'm pretty sure that boat 2nd from the left was my grandfather's ship.  LST 309.  Crazy to think he is in the photo somewhereIn *The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant*, which may be the finest memoirs ever by a U.S. President, Grant devotes many chapters to the Mexican-American War and the U.S. Civil War. This is no surprise. However, to those unfamiliar with the text, it often comes as a surprise how much attention Grant devotes to *logistics*.  In popular imagining, new technologies like machine guns were decisive in the Civil War, but from the point of view of America's top general, such things weren't even worth mentioning. Victory resulted from being able to move his cannons and food to where he wanted them to be.[Meanwhile, back in America](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7493/15944038808_a049f08ec3_h.jpg)[deleted]
""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""

James doohanThis is an incredible and amazing photo.  Reading about the landings and that day and the horror of just the one battle, it's a mind blowing thought to me that as safe as these particular soldiers must have felt, they were just getting started with the war.

I can't comprehend how mentally taxing battle must have been.  If you survive, you know there's more coming.  In Stephen Ambrose's book ""D-Day,"" which I highly recommend, he compares the D-Day landings to taking every man, woman, child, vehicle, and supply in Green Bay, Wisconsin—everything in the entire city not bolted down—and moving it across Lake Michigan in 24 hours while under constant fire.Where are all those metal things that you usually see in movies depicting D-day.

It was before the Bears match yesterday[OP right after taking this picture](http://media.giphy.com/media/vJKeu2upniCSk/giphy.gif).Stealth - 11/10 

IGNI *just* finished two hours of reading about the development of the stealth bomber.  TIL:  That a scale model was made with the functional RCS technique and placed atop a $186,000 pole to make it high enough to fire radar at it.  When the radar returned only a blip for the pole, the operator sent guys to put the plane back on top, as it has clearly fallen off.  It had not.  

BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ALL 'MURICA. 

Unsatisfied, apparently, with seeing the blip of the pole...they ordered the design and construction of *a new pole made with stealth capabilities.*  They made an effin stealth *pole.*  No info on how many workers died running into it while setting it up.

Bonus TIL:  1)Stealth bombers were the first planes ever designed by a team lead by the electrical engineer.  2)When designing the shape of the plane, they created software to test for the desired effect on radar systems.  They were unable to even consider panels that were curved, as the the computers running the test algorithms would still be working on the results *today,* which is why they are flat.  This design and the total lack of traditional aerodynamics led to it being nicknamed Hopeless Diamond.  This could have so easily been photo shopped and I wouldn't even be mad if it was.Where was this taken?For all who say they need proof, this is as much as I can do, [the next shot](http://i.imgur.com/RNxF7re.jpg) in the HDR burst.

Seven hued shells, and the rooster will become a god.Each one has a different power-up right?[For anyone curious](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/why_are_chicken_eggs_different_colors) about why chicken eggs come in different colors. Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

>All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hen’s oviduct. The journey through the chicken’s oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg.Wow, it's a very artistic photograph :DCould you possibly post a picture of each hen showing which egg is hers? That would be cool to see.Banjo Kazooie!hen partyI've seen every single one of those from my mother's hens.

The customer approaches you with their purchase(es), perhaps wearing a slight smile and greeting you kindly. You ring up their items, exchanging in some well-worn small talk that you have used over and over again for the past few hours. When you inform the customer of their total, the customer suddenly says, ""I hope you don't mind change.""

And there it is. Before then it had only been heard of in legend, mentioned in the tales of other more seasoned cashiers that have seen every horror of the job. You had scoffed at it then--how badly could a baggy be, after all? But then you see it yourself, unable to help yourself from cringing at the sound of the weight of coinage being dropped upon your counter. You look from The Baggy to the total, and then to the line of customers gathering behind The Baggy Holder.

You realize that you cannot be defeated. Not by this. Certainly not by a pile of coins and the piece of plastic that contains them. You must endure so that one day you are able to tell this tale in hopes to warn another unfortunate soul about the existance of The Baggy.

You open The Baggy with trembling hands and begin the count...the stereotype lives on.Used to work at a movie theater.  Teens would come in and ask to see an R rated movie they were clearly not old enough to see and dump a bag of pennies on my counter and giggle.  So I'd count them.  Slowly.  Purposefully.  They'd begin to get impatient (2 minutes before the movie, hurry up!)  Then I'd ""lose"" count.  Gotta start again.  Finally they would just stand there and fume.  I'd finish, let them know they had enough, then ask for ID.  None of them even bothered to try to bring a fake one.  Booted them out.

Give me pennies, prepare to wait mofo's.The guy counting the quarters is probably thinking *""what the fuck am I doing with my life""*he should have paid with the gold he keeps hidden in a bag around his neck.As a person who works in retail, fuck people like this. This has happened so many times at my store that my manager has told me I don't have to accept large payments that are made with change. Seriously is it so hard to go to the bank and get bills?That is a total dick move. I get if you are proud that you saved up enough quarters to buy an iPod, but stop by the fucking bank first and cash that shit in. Don't make the poor sales guy deal with that shit. Illegal to do that in Canada. You're only allowed to use quarters for purchases up to $10.

** (2) A payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:
(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and
(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

[Source](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/page-1.html#s-8.)What a douche bag. When I was a bank teller a common customer came in with fucking $600 of unsorted change. I tried to explain to him that a branch just 2 miles away had a change sorting machine but we didn't. 

I was also the only teller working for that 2 hours, which is about how long it took me. He also told me that he had counted and I was off by $30. 

I almost quit right there. ... He actually looks like the kind of guy who owns a small, yet successful, chain of laundromats and a handful of vending machines.

Of course, that same look applies to a great number of private investigators as well.  They just usually don't have the quarters like this guy does.

(Polo shirt, not quite physically fit, constantly on phone or internet so as to keep things moving in the business).This guy is being a jerk. He's a grown ass man who could easily go to bank to get his coins counted up and pay with bills.  And yet here he is on his smart phone wasting his and everyone's time.Why did he have to be wearing a kippah? We've come so far. And now we're back at square one.

Oy vey.I know this is never going to get read, but all comments regarding the Jewish stereotype and poor retail worker aside this really reflects poorly on the management.  If I was a supervisor at this Best Buy and I saw this going on I would have pulled this man aside and counted the quarters myself, in an office, while I would have my cashier service other customers.  Just because you have an inconsiderate customer doesn't mean that you should let your other customers and your employees suffer.  Simply tell them ""We are not a bank""and the best buy guy should have taken the extra few minutes and sifted through the  quarters for silver. there was no doubt probably 15-30 silver quarters. tell your boss you need change and swap out a $20 for the silver quarters. would have made the counting of  quarters worth it.While I was in college, a grad student across the hall from me saved up his change from the time he was like 12.  

He bought a 56"" flatscreen with it.  About $2000, all in a giant crayon that weighed probably 200 lbs.  

The Best Buy crew had to count it out at customer service.  Took about three hours.When I was a Supervisor at Best Buy I'd happily go grab the change counter from Ops room and use it count that shit.

Those types of customer are either looking for an argument or think that putting some minimum wage high school kid through the wringer is *fun*. Taking away their fun is the only way to win.Assuming he bought a 16 GB iPad Mini at $329, with tax comes out to roughly $350. This is about 1400 quarters. If the cashier counted the quarters for 15 minutes, he counted about 93 quarters every minute, which is 3 quarters every 2 seconds.

My guess is that the fanned out area where cars used to park to see the movie is somewhat contaminated from oil and exhaust from cars, making that ground less fertile.  In fact, I see that bushes are growing in the car-park area, but in distinct lines, probably where cars didn't park or drive.

Please don't tell me you're charging people for photography of this quality. If you are just mucking around and taking photos for friends, that's fine (and I hope you're enjoying yourself!). But you should not be allowing people to put faith in you (and give you probably large sums of money) to document what might be the biggest event in their life when you are clearly not qualified to perform this work.

If you can look past the god-awful quality/sharpness/resolution of the image (are you using consumer gear or a point and shoot?) and even further past the basic compositional errors (have you ever studied any other wedding photography before?) the photos still don't appear to have any of effort put into colour correction, cropping, lens issue correction, or any other kind of post production.

You should be less concerned about slipping in ""clever"" reflections, and actually focus on learning how to use a camera. You are far, far from the point where you should be watermarking your images and calling yourself a professional.

It comes from the cambium area of the tree and is not adequately dense (structurally inferior and vulnerable to decomposition).As somebody who's seen a lot of pallets, those are the nicest pallets I've ever seen.

Usually I'm happy if they don't try to take my arm off when I pick one up.And, apparently, you have a spot to choke a baby and no one will see. Yes. And house plants. Because when you need a house so badly that you'll make one out of pallets, houseplants are also a huge priority.That's an art project. In what emergency would you happen to have 20 pallets on hand from which to build a house? If your house blows down, but you can drive to the local home center to steal their pallets, you probably should just go to a motel. >You can also upgraded it in time with insulation, AC, smoke detectors and anything else you would like.

Charging for the plans invalidates the humanitarian purposes!I can't think of an emergency that would require me to build a pallet house that would not also destroy my apparently large stock of pallets.one day my assAll I can think of is pokémon..Fatal oversight. If you have this many pallets to build the structure there is probably a more sturdy structure nearby housing all the goods that came in on these pallets. In case you have never worked in a warehouse environment, pallets are usually fucking disgusting; covered in dust, goo and other crap and usually don't make it to their final destination in one piece.  They also aren't exactly cheap, I work in trucking and lots of places that do 'pallet exchange' charge upwards of $5 a pallet, you could probably afford a couple 2x4s for that amount of money.  Unless you are prepared to buy all new pallets for this endeavor it seems kind of dumb.

Reminds me of an unrelated joke about airplanes!

**A** small two-seater Cessna 152 plane crashed into a cemetery early this afternoon.

Search and rescue workers have found two survivors and recovered 300 bodies so far and expect that number to climb as digging continues into the evening.I saw one in person and it literally unsettled me.  It's very very strange looking at it closely; it's like your sense of vision goes a little bit wonky and your point of focus kind of slips and slides off the lines of the fuselage leaving with you a sense that it's unnatural and that even after having examined it closely you're still not sure of its shape, like it wasn't designed by humans.

It was much more advanced than reasonably possible in the 60's, heck, it still is 50 years later and I say that it's the sexiest machine ever built.

EDIT: Didn't intend to insinuate aliens.  Go watch a proper documentary, ya bunch o' loonies!An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.

""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

If you enjoyed that story, check out the subreddit dedicated to the Blackbird: /r/SR71I use to live in Mildenhall, U.K. for all of my childhood life.  Seeing these taking off and landing was amazing.  I use to bunk off school to go down the landing lights to watch these fly out. The air shows they had every year allowed you to get up close and talk to the pilots.  Stunning planes! Definite highlight for me at the museum of flight in SeattleYou can view one of these lovely planes at Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.My husband and I were crew chiefs on the KC-135Q model at Beale AFB.  One night we got the call, grabed our mobility bags and headed for the flightline.  We ended up flying to Florida, landing and refueling, took back off and when we got to altitude we called down to Control in Florida, who then placed a call to California to tell them that we were at altitude over Florida.  Then and only then, did the SR take off in California so that we could refuel them over Florida.   That is fast!  When your refuel plane has to be in the air and ready all the way across the country before you can even take off.  The 135 had to go full throttle during the refuel, that think shook so bad one would think that it was going to shake apart.  Crew chiefs were allowed to lay in the boom pod with the boomer during the refuel.  It was awesome!""WHYYYYYYYY?!....WHY YOU AL-WAYS KICK ME WHEN III'M....HIIIIIGGGGHHHHH?!""Airplane?  This shit was designed to haunt dreams.  Not carry passengers.Should out to evergreen aviation museum, it has one partially opened sr71, the spruce goose, and a myriad of other cool fighters, jet liners, and even a free tanks. Just outside Mcminnville, OregonI've always wondered what replaced the SR-71's role in the modern day air force.X-Jet?http://imgur.com/aETYDXBA few random items. All planes get metal fatigue with microscopic cracks, that over a lifetime, will eventually ground the airframe. The SR-71 was composed of titanium and heated up so much during its flights, that the plane would stretch about a foot in length and the heat would soften the metal so much that it would fill in the cracks. The airframe was basically reforged every flight. It also got more and more fuel efficient the faster it flew. The only limitation on its top speed was the engine cones would melt after Mach 3.7 or so. The A-12 flew slightly higher and slightly faster because it was lighter with only having 1 person on board and 1 bay for reconnaissance as opposed to the SR-71's 3 bays for reconnaissance.

Also, Wright Patterson is the world's oldest and largest aviation museum. They are moving the presidential and experimental planes to the main campus next spring so you will no longer have to take a shuttle bus or miss those exhibits if and when you visit.You might like [this](http://www.nmusafvirtualtour.com/media/068/SR-71A%20Front%20Cockpit.html) a 3d view of the cockpit.

Also, find a copy of Sled Driver on pdf by Brian Schul. Well worth the read.""The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. An advanced long range strategic reconnaissance aircraft capable of mach 3 and an altitude of 85,000 feet.""

""You sure do know a lot about it..""

""DO YOU EVEN READ MY CHRISTMAS LIST?""Go to RAF Duxford, you can reach over ropes and touch one. If anyone is interested in learning more about the SR-71 and a couple of very Top Secret aircraft, at the time, I would suggest reading the book *Skunk Works* it is a great read.


Fun fact, every second that this plane was flying at Mach 3 the engines took in the same amount of air as 2 *million* people breathing in at the same time.From **Sled Driver: Flying The World's Fastest Jet** - There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact.

I played paintball with a previous boss who showed up in a ghillie suit. We made fun of him, at first.

This fucking guy layed down in the patchiest, dirtiest piece of land and pinned us down. 4 of us could not find him. We KNEW here was there because the goddamn grass kept shooting at us. But we couldn't figure out which patch of grass it was, or what part of that patch was him.

Un fucking real.Storytime: Years ago, when I was in the newspaper business, I was at a house covering a standoff. A fellow journalist and I were standing outside chatting for about an hour.

He didn't want us messing with it, but every now and then when he was away, I'd sneak it down from the attic and play spy. I did this all through middle school, hiding in bushes and fields, trying to see how close I could get to people without them noticing.

One time I was trying to sneak up on a small herd of deer that were hanging around in a field by the highway. I got really close, when suddenly this car pulls over, and the driver gets out. He slammed his door, which scared the deer away. :(

He also apparently pulled over to take a leak, and thought the small grassy outcropping was a good target to piss on. I was a good spy. I never compromised my position.I completely missed the other two snipers in the background.This reminds me of a time I had a sleepover with a friend who insisted to stay the night.  We stayed up late playing call of duty 4 and he kept getting frustrated saying ""I fucking hate wookies.  I don't want to play Star Wars.""   

He was complaining about the snipers in their ghillies and also refrained from telling me that prior to our sleepover, he had ingested quite a bit of hallucinogens.

Stick with Link3, it really is the best.Fun fact, the French government allows tax relief to shepherds who voluntarily provide and maintain sheep on plots of land that are believed to have a number of undetonated mines. The idea is that without putting human lives at risk, sheep can detonate landmines over time while the owner of the sheep is compensated for the possibility of losing said sheepIt is absolutely mind boggling the scales of WW1 and WW2. I have traveled around much of Europe and South East Asia, retracing troop movements and big battles. Some of the places seem like it just took place in the past decade. The sheer size of these wars are just simply unimaginable. Reminds me of the final episode of Blackadder :'-(That is beautiful, but also quite eye opening.  I imagine you could spend an afternoon digging around in there, and you are pretty much guaranteed to find some soil.Ah yes, the trenches of Beaumont-Hamel. The 1st Royal Newfoundland Regiment's probably more well known battles. July 1st, 9:15am, of the 780 men, all from the 1RNR involved in the 3rd wave of attacks (all attacks before completely failed), only 110 survived, and only 68 were available for roll call next morning. This picture is just East of the Caribou Memorial for the 1RNR. By the looks of the craters this was a German trench because a week before the charge, the Allies bombarded the German line with artillery and mortar. Unfortunately it did not weaken their defenses.[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont-Hamel_Newfoundland_Memorial) is the story of this trench.Some scars never heal completely[deleted]Were the trenches originally straight and they have eroded over time, or were they dug like that? If the landmines are all gone, that would be one hell of a playground.Considering the fronts weren't moving much and it was essentially feeding meat into a grinder from both sides ... just imagine how many people died in that picture alone over those 4 years. :/[Welcome to the lovely Cercen Pass.]  (http://i.imgur.com/mLSXLBt.jpg)  Where you can still find many remnants of the oft-forgotten Frozen War of the Alps.

The Italians established many gun positions and camps [on mountaintops like these.](http://i.imgur.com/JSCO29y.jpg)

The Austria efforts were equally Sisyphean.  [On Marmolada, the highest mountain in the Dolomites,](http://i.imgur.com/n88KSic.jpg) the Austrian Corps of Engineers built an entire ""ice city""—a complex of tunnels, dormitories, and [storerooms dug out of the bowels of the glacier.](http://i.imgur.com/Iu2H7gM.jpg)  Only to lose it to the Italians.  Who in turn lost it the next winter to the combined Austrian/German forces.  In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

.

We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie

In Flanders fields.


.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.Imagine if the Grand Canyon was originally a trench for giantsAnd every hole is where an artillery shell hit, its really astonishing to look at Verdun and other sections of north-eastern France and Belgium.

Fun fact, their still digging up undetonated land mines, shells and grenades from that area (The red zone i think its called) so about 102 years of cleaning.Australians died there. Motherfucking Australians from the other side of the damn world. This might be a good time to mention The Great War on YouTube is covering WW1 week by week as it was 100 years ago with added bonus videos.

And no I don't work for them it's really that good.There's a BBC documentary called ""The First World War From Above""  that's currently on US Netflix (and, apparently, [also on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8C_CIdmk8)) that does a great job of exploring the scars that the trenches and battles of WWI left on Europe. Well worth a watch.to put the First world war into perspective, there is a 1 foot thick layer of iron stained soil which stretches across parts of France and Belgium which is entirely composed of shrapnel and debris from the war. 

the trenches, shell craters and structures may erode away, but the layer of war will remain for millennia below the surface. Pictures from WWI continue to amaze me and instill a sense of humbleness and pride (being Canadian, and all). I have been fortunate enough to visit Vimy Ridge and the surrounding area twice. The first time the monument was being restored, so thankfully I was able to go again a couple years ago. It was a great experience, and I highly suggest anyone go if you get the chance. From what I remember, the tours at Vimy Ridge are free; you just sign up for a time when you get there. I also suggest renting a car and just driving all over. You will stumble upon many different WWI and WWII sites that are must-sees. Can't wait to go back!

Even though this will be buried, if anyone is interested in seeing pictures, feel free to ask.There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools, singing at night,

And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,

Would scarcely know that we were gone.

- Sara TeasdaleWell how do you do now, you Willie MacBride?
Do you mind if I sit down beside your graveside
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun?
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done 

Well I see by your gravestone you was only nineteen
When you joined the great fallen of nineteen sixteen
Well I hope you died well and I hope you died clean
Or Willie MacBride was it low and obscene? 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Did you leave a young wife or a sweetheart behind?
In some faithful heart are your memories enshrined?
For although you died back in nineteen sixteen
In that faithful heart you're forever nineteen 

Or are you a stranger without even a name
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane
In an old photograph tor, battered and stained
Faded to yellow with brown leather frayed?


Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

As the sun beats down on the green fields of France
There's a soft summer breeze makes the red poppies dance
And see how the sun shines from under the clouds
There's no gas, there's no barbed wire, no guns firing now 

Oh but here in this grave yard it's still no man's land
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
And through man's blind indifference to his fellow man
To a whole generation who were butchered and damned 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Now Willie MacBride, I can't help wonder why
All those that lie here now why did they die?
And did they believe when they answered the call
Did they really believe tat this war could end wars? 

Oh the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain
The killing and dying, 'twas all done in vain
For, Willie MacBride, oh it happened again
And again and again and again and again 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest?

You'll notice that every small plane points opposite to the large excitation of the planar field; if you add up the planar vectors of all small individual planes, they will always be equal and opposite to the larger planar excitation.Some one call Nikon, they'll love this.

I lived in one for 7 years.  It was heaven, especially with babies/toddlers.  A warm floor for baby to hang out on is fabulous.  Many people chose to rip out the boiler required to run the system and install central heat.  Those people regretted it.  Radiant Floor Heating. Yes, they are very effective. They usually use a small boiler and run a type of liquid through the piping. Along with good use of insulation in the walls/floor/ceiling - these can save a lot of money in the long-run. And bare feet in winter are great!

Edit: A few people are saying this system pictured is electric. Perfectly possible, I know electric systems are also available. I work for a building supply company and we are just getting into the Radiant Heat in the past month or two.I went to Iceland in December, and was pleasantly surprised to find that many buildings are heated this way. They basically get free heated water from wells, and pump it through the floors. They were even in the process of getting this outside of the airport in Reykjavik.I never knew this looked that cool. I'd just throw some plexi glass over it and have some led strips and go all tron on it. The whole floor is lava and thus off limitsThat was my one regret when I had my bathroom redone, that I didn't get heated floor. I'm still kicking myself.The Weltzheimer/Johnson House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright had a system similar to this design.  That was back in 1948.  The problem occurred when the contractor ignored the grade of the material specified on the architectural drawing, and the system never worked properly.I lived in Korea for 5 years and every apartment I lived in had it. I really miss it.Rich friend had underfloor heating in his basment. A blanket on his concert floor felt better than my bedThese are great for bathroom floors! I've been looking for some kind of warming bath mat that doesn't require an outlet (because most bathroom outlets are high up so a wire would have to run all the way up and look unsightly) but apparently those are more of a thing in Japan than in the states...when i was in korea i had those boy it was so great . i wish we had them back in the states.Is this form of heating uncommon in the states? In Denmark where I live, nearly all houses (especially the ones built within the last 20 or so years) have them.Any idea whether these are more efficient?Well driller here, although it may cost a good chunk of change for the average home owner, vertical or horizontal geothermal loops can be drilled to various depths, essentially sharing Earth's energy with your home. I live in South Korea and this is the best thing ever. It's in every apartment. Just don't leave trash or laundry on the floor for too long. Wow I didnt know you can get that attention with somthing simple as a floor heating.
I live in switzerland and am a HVAC engenieer and this systems are standard since the 70es for residential buildings. Nowadays we plan them with water temperatures of around 30°-35°C, so the floor doesent really feel warm at all, but with really well insulated homes you dont need higher temperatures to heat the home which is really good if you use heatpumps because the efficency of the heatpumps are way better if you use low temperature systems like that.
The most efficient systems are TABS (thermo active building systems) where you build the pipes inside the concrete itself and use the concerete as a heat reserve, also good for cooling.
Sorry for my bad english, if someone wants more information just contact me :)
What kind of flooring gets put on top of this base?Here's what 1500 square metres looks like http://i.imgur.com/jFPnxh7.jpgHad a Schluter heated floor put in our master bathroom.

The City of Boston claims a 60% reduction in power consumption and full replacement paying of in just 2-3 years.  Fantastic program.The light pollution effect is *very* evident in this picture.  Notice the foliage between the lamps on either side--the traditional lighting shows an orange bleed for the entire area, yet the trees between the LED lamps are almost completely unilluminated.Those orange lights sure are going to be nostalgic in 20 years...Which city is this?From this angle, the LED lamp posts look to be more efficiently directing the light. Compared to the conventional post which appears to be shining light everywhere with limited efficiency. Unless there is a great deal of reflection of light from the pavement, I'd say that light pollution is less likely. The way I understand it, LED's are more directional that conventional light bulbs. But that's only my opinion.LED looks much more natural. I hate the orange street lights. Always have. Wish this was happening on my street!/r/darksky would like this.depends on the white balance on your camera tooThey started this in my city, and I'm actually not a fan of it.

I travel on a highway to work almost every day. The lamp posts are more spaced apart and much higher up than in this picture, so the light is less concentrated and the dark spots you see in this photo are much larger. 

The orange street lights spread the light out better and didn't leave dark patches like the LED's did. The LED's are worse during the winter as well because they are much dimmer in my city than in this picture. The orange lights help distinguish definition on the road much better, but with the LED street lights, its harder to tell where icy/deep snow patches might be.

These would be a great for city driving where the posts are usually shorter and closer together and would illuminate the street as well as it does in this picture, but for highway and winter driving, the orange is better.

But that's just my opinionI, personally, prefer warmer colored lights.They did this to my street sometime around 3 weeks ago. It only really decreases light pollution above lamp level. You know, reduces the pink sky effect. 

The HUGE downside is that the inside of my house looks like daytime now. And the light is blue. Blue = bad at night (thanks f.lux). 

I used to be able to sleep with my curtains open. White curtains. I hadn't slept well in a week, and had one of those aha moments when you're lying in bed at 2am, curtains closed, looking at the ceiling and thinking holy crap its bright blue in here, with the curtains closed, its bright as hell. 

Replaced my white curtains with red ones to mute out the blue, and now I'm fine. Then I think, how many people will lose sleep like me, and not realize the issue, and then wake up and screw my commute by driving tired and getting into accidents. 


And also, why couldn't the get a warmer colour temp for the LED's? Blue sucks, at least give me yellow or something. These new lights have been attracting the gypsy moths back

Wanna put shout out to r/invasivespecies for the info!I have no source for this, just something that I heard, but apparently there is some question over the long term health effects that replacing the sodium lamps will have. The white LEDs simulate sunlight, whereas the sodium lamps are more similar to candlelight in terms of coloring. I guess there is some discussion over whether or not this shift will disrupt the natural sleep cycles of people walking around at night, or even having this light shining in through their windows. 

On a small scale, the shift is not expected to be bad, but if they were to replace every street lamp, apparently there might be some problems. 

Anyone care to verify or dispute these claims? Idk if OP knows but the LED lamps probably look better in this picture because of the white balance setting on the camera that captured this shot. Maybe I'm nitpicking though.Chicago resident here... They have been slowly replacing the old street lights the the new LED bulbs over the past few years in our glorious city. They got to our street last fall and once the polar vortex struck with its powerful might we noticed the streets were dark at night. The new bulbs couldn't melt the snow and ice off the lamps like they use to!! They actually had crew go around and knock the buildup off. Thanks Obama!Replacing sodium vapor lamps with white LEDs as street lights is a good plan, but not a great one.  I think that replacing them with red or orange LEDs would have been a much better idea, since you still need your night vision once you leave that road that looks like it's lit by the sun.I hate the cold white of the LED street lamps... I liked my warm orange glow =(It's worth noting the Hwite balance of the photo is set to the temperature of the LED lights so it makes the Tungsten lights look like shit; not a really fair photography.

[A photograph I took for Instance](http://i.imgur.com/u5JREM5.jpg), the camera White Balance was set for the Tungsten lights up front, the halogen around the side as a result turned a a very noticeable Green color in the photography; with the naked eye the lights looked the same.I wish they'd tint them orange. It's easier on the eyes for night driving I thought. (Other than that the old ones were naturally reddish).That tall building in the background has a faceThe building almost directly centre looks so happy.Random note - the yellow/orange lights actually produce more lumens (more light) per bulb, but due to the light being more omni-directional and having a bad color-rendering index, to humans the LEDs appear like a much better light. This looked so Korean, so I zoomed in and found that it was Korea.LEDs are a complicated issue. They save energy but the cheapest kind emit blue-rich light which simulate the daylight which can be harmful to humans and animals alike. The rule to remember is to use red light at night. Just the other day, LEDs received a Nobel Prize. You can read about how that might affect dark skies and light pollution [here](http://darksky.org/night-sky-conservation/421).

Seriously though how the fuck is a model mattress more likely to cause death than a regular one?


edit** the answer is the same answer to most questions in life: [fire](/spoiler)That can't be legal.That's what you get for buying from Bluth Co.It's a Homefill. Is 12 the number of victims?How or why is it necessary to have a prop mattress? Why not just supply an existing mattress off the factory run? Surely it's harder to have a separate manufacturing line for fake mattresses, no?Ran to my bedroom almost hoping that my back-breaking bed was a prop, but it's just a shitty bed.Did the owner [do this](http://blog.chron.com/tubular/files/2011/11/mission-accomplished-ad.gif) after you signed the lease?I'm a DM for Mattress Firm. PM me if you need something new and I'll get you something as cheap as I can get it without getting fired.check your TV, it might be a prop as well It's dangerous because that material is likely HIGHLY flammable.  Beds must have a flame resistance to them, and since thats NOT a bed, its a PROP, it could go up in flames instantly. It was fit for a queen, however I'm pretty sure there was a pea in the mattress.

You needed 5 more on top of that m'thinks.Do you smell that?

Smells like a lawsuit.

At the very least they need to buy you a new Mattress and a 10 pack of visits to your local Chiropractor's office (mine does $75 for an extended visit with heat and electrical stimulus if you pay in cash)This is a lawsuit if it's actually real. Canadian here chiming in; that is seriously wrong. In Canada, all hotels must pass a bi-monthly law of the ""soft touch"" bed test. They actually have people visit and test hotel beds for softness.Do you live in Sudden Valley?Brings a whole new meaning to death bed.People used to always joke about why it is against the law to rip tags off of mattresses. This is why it's the law, so you don't buy a dud mattress from a shady dealer. (Though, it can be removed by the consumer, so you're lucky it is still there.)Sounds like it's from the Bluth model home.I would check your lease documents to see if there is any stipulations about the furniture, have a lawyer review it as well and write the landlord a letter to have a new mattress purchased or at least a prorated amount to purchase a new one. Also renters insurance might cover some chiropractic visits to help with the back pain. Most of all talk to a lawyer to see if there is a legal avenue for you to pursue. 
good luck!I wonder if Michael Bluth had this problem.Is this your house?

Cus it get cold like Minnesota.It's a lovely picture, but a little editing would really help bring it out.  Some noise reduction, especially in the shadows, would help clean up the tones and a little bump in contrast and clarity would help it pop.

[I gave it a little play in photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/YWPZVHE.jpg) - mainly what I said and also straightening the lines up a little.    There wasn't a whole lot I could do with the low-res JPEG.  

Editing is a very important part of the photographic process.  Getting the image as correct as possible in camera is great, but editing is almost always needed to tidy it up.  

Another little tip, is that print you've had done on canvas?  Get it printed on good quality semi-gloss paper and framed (even a really cheap, basic frame) and it'll do the image the justice it deserves.  You could probably get it printed on decent paper for $10-15, and a frame like [this](http://www.therange.co.uk/fashion-black-box-frame//the-range/fcp-product/51577) - with the photo either window-mounted or at least with a white border between the image and frame.

First dogs, then cats, guinea pigs, miniature horses, 500 pound pot bellied pigs, and now a god damned turkey. 

Next it will be lizards and snakes and the government is going to shut it all down and limit it to dogs and miniature horses like they did for service animals. 

These hipsters are just shitting in the punch bowl because anyone can pay a shrink to say a fucking turkey is an emotional support animal.

So when all of this comes to a head in a perfect storm where someone's therapy python eats a therapy turkey 30,000 feet above Colorado I'll get to say I told you so. Looks like Sweet Dee in ""The Gang Beats Boggs""Adam Carolla has a whole bit about taking Giligan, his attack pelican, onto a flight as therapy pet.  

Life isn't much wackier than comedy.IF you are so unstable that you can't fly on a plane without a live turkey, you should not fly. Imagine if that bird died mid flight? Buddy could do anything. avian flu - the originDelta airlines requires a mental health professional to provide written documentation that the passenger is being treated for a diagnosed mental health disability and the animal is a necessary part of treatment. Further, the animal is required to be trained to behave. I'm guessing this passenger didn't follow those rules, and the crew and gate agents didn't know enough to deny passage.

From the website:

**Acceptance Guidelines**

May or may not be trained to perform observable functions. However, the animal must be trained to behave properly in public settings as service animals do. Emotional support animals travel free of charge and the animal is exempt from cabin allotment. Like service animals, emotional support animals can be transported in the cabin.

Delta requires documentation *(not more than one year old) on letterhead from a licensed mental health professional to be presented to an agent upon check in stating:

* Title, address, license number and jurisdiction (state/country it was issued), phone number, and signature of mental health professional.
* The passenger has a mental health related disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 4th Edition.
* That the passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination.
* That the person listed in the letter is under the care of the assessing physician or mental health professional.

*Passengers may use a signed or stamped digital letter on their mobile device as long as the information can be verified (i.e. phone numbers, email addresses etc.)I'd be doing this the entire flight to the bird 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zvgcOrTtwMy hopes of one day having a service Cassawary have been reignited!The only reason anyone would ever need a goddamn dumb dinosaur like a turkey for a therapy animal is if they needed absolute reassurance they weren't quite the stupidest organism in the room. And even then, itd be close.If their plane crashes in the mountains at least they won't need to start eating each other right away like those soccer players did.I hate these assholes, it makes it so much harder for those of us with legitimate, trained, vetted and certified service dogs.

I tried so hard to be nice about it for so long but I just can't any more. The day someone's glorified pet, with no public access training attacked my service dog was the day the minor annoyance of it became a real issue I'm pushed passed my limits on. You want to take your unleashed, uneutered mastiff with a piece of shit paper you bought online everywhere for the attention? Fuck you. 

When that dog bit someone on the bus now we all have to pay for photo ID of us and our dog, thankfully I already have that since one of countries I regularly travel to(in the EU) requires it.

--
**Remember business owners:** 
Even certified service dogs, let alone bullshit ESAs,  have a set of public access behaviour guidelines, you CAN remove an animal who is NOT behaving within those guidelines. 

The dog taking the initiative of greeting strangers approaching the animal should be a clue the dog is not properly public accessed trained. The dog should automatically ignore others because it is WORKING, as in focused on it's handler and it's job.


This even includes the handler responsibilities, like keeping the animal from being any kind of nuisance- via position on the floor or noise or general disruptiveness; and keeping the animal groomed, clean and non-offensive to the general public. Dogs will always smell somewhat like dogs but the dog should not be excessively smelly, should not be drooling excessively, should not be shedding excessively as the animal should be brushed daily by the handler or helper. Nails should be tidily cut and not damaging floors. 
Harness/ID vests should be clean and properly fitted. (in the US service dogs do not have to have badges or harnesses, but this is pretty ridiculous, almost everyone with a certified service dog will have it wearing it's identification vest/badge and harness because it makes life easier for the handler!! If the badges on the dog says 'do not seperate from handler' there is a reason for this- please respect this, yes even in an emergency. For example my dog traveled with me in the ambulance after a serious car accident until we absolutely had to be separated so he could receive medical treatment. During something like an MRI/X ray he is in the operator's hut in the same room as the machine but protected. )
 


And remember: ESAs do NOT have federal access rights. They have some housing and transport rights but they DO NOT have access rights to stores, theatres or restaurants!

(Also the Service Dog Foundation is now training ESA cats with proper certification and are vetted behaviour-wise, if you need a non service dog but do need an ESA get a properly trained and bred one. Get a prescription, apply to an accrediated organisation, preferable ADI certified,  and get on the waiting list like those of use with seizues/are blind and low vision have to do. Stop with this special snowflake pretend service animal bullshit. I'm sorry to sound so mean but in the past three years the rise of this ESA crap has been a real burden on those of us with real service dogs. The animal just existing is not  a job. Training a proper, bomb proof service dog starts *before the puppy's eyes are even open!!*)More like ""anxiety animal"" for me. I would constantly be worried that thing we attack others or myself hahaI'd need therapy if that thing was looking at me for 2 hours.[Gobbels!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeOeIwKJ67g)I thought turkeys can't fly.What I want to know is how do they keep the turkey from shitting everywhere?! Does it have a bag to catch the poo?I thought turkeys are widely considered to be assholes? Perhaps if you suffer from such anxiety that you need a therapy turkey, you should drive instead of flying. 600 miles in a car with a live turkey sounds like the perfect thing to prevent this insane shit from happening.As a Vegan, I have a therapy-cucumber. You'd never guess where I hide it. One flew over the turkey's nestMaybe that turkey is full of narcotics.

Their babies are lain in clutches and then promptly forgotten (though even to say that they are forgotten is incorrect, since forgetting requires some initial presence of mind: in truth this tortoise has perhaps never been truly aware [in the human sense] of what exactly its instincts force it to do). There is no plausible scenario in which those little tortoises would possibly find themselves on top of their mother: first because they are tiny and second because their mother is no more significant to them than a pile of dirt or a largish chunk of granite. In fact it is in the baby tortoises' best interest to stay away from their mother since (as I said before) the mother has no maternal instinct whatsoever and could easily and inadvertently crush them underfoot or knock them on their backs or harm them in some other way (the chance of this happening is admittedly pretty slim, but there is certainly a greater chance that the mother will hurt them rather then help them [which {I pray I have made abundantly clear} is exactly zero since tortoises have no maternal instincts whatsoever]). This is anthropomorphising at its worst and images like this that actively misinform people through implication are no different than any other kind of clickbait in that they convolute a genuinely interesting subject by (rather than putting forth the effort required to present something both interesting and informative) simply slapping an eye-catching title on a misleading image. Can we not simply accept that certain animals behave differently than us? This is a successful reproductive strategy: the product of millions upon millions of years of evolution (or perhaps not: I can't imagine ignoring your children requires a lot of evolutionary finesse: but still, the fact that it has not changed into something else speaks to how effective it is).

I didn't have any destination I wanted to explore. It is a big city, but it is also not big.

The thing that amazed me is that architecture and history you can find that are off the main tourist areas. You can walk and see a building 400 plus years old with old historic doors. Inside a courtyard with cobble stones and people living their lives in buildings that would be historic in America.

You can walk by and go inside many churches hundreds of years old that people still use. See one of the small Museums that dot the city. Walking you can find the most amazing restaurants, grab a quick drink and see the city move around you.

Maybe I should feel bad, but when walking Paris I couldn't help to think to myself I am glad the French left the war early and it was spared destruction in the war. I get weird Devil May Cry vibes from it.Pretty sure that's also the door from Casper... or at least very close to it. An amazing example of art nouveau.First stop after retirement: Paris. Any takers?  I speak French. Must see it before it's detroyed in some dumb money/oil war.Belle Epoque was the epitome of that kind of design. It died with WW1 and the end of the European empires. I wish Art Nouveau would return. It was very labour intensive but perhaps CNC, CAD and 3D printing will see it return in a updated fashion. Its so florid and strikes me as 'human'. ""Arts Craft"" in many ways is a distilled version of this, boiling designs to their bare, hand made essentials.

It must have seemed like the end of the era of Legend, to those who born in this period, grew up and then served in WW1.We not talking about the massive cock  on the door? Reminds me of a pun in French/English.

[This blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/) explains the whole story. 

Today (by co-incidence) there was a [follow-up post](http://digileaders.com/ok-think-loud-organisational-culture/) with some other thoughts.

To answer a few of the questions I've seen in the thread:

* I work at the UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) and yes, we are hiring
* yes this is real
* no, there was no input from Human Resources or from senior management
* we did it because we work in an organisation where doing things like this is ok
* it's not aspirational; this is a list of things newcomers need to know about how things already are
* yes that's our office building in central London, but we share the building with other organisations so it's not all ours
* the poster mentions Slack because Slack is one of the tools we use to get stuff done; we use many other tools too :)
* as others have pointed out, there's a print-your-own PDF linked from [the original blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/), so if you'd like to put a copy up on your wall, you can

> stay home when you feel ill

I wish more people did this. I work in a large building with a lot of employees. They'll cough, sniffle, sneeze, wipe their nose and just generally leak. 

It's gross, and you're not a 'trooper"" for working when you're sick, you're putting me at risk of catching whatever nasty-ass shit you've caught.

Stay home and rest - don't make the rest of us have what you have.

EDIT: of course this only applies to companies that give you sick time![Picture of the boss.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yHJVlf-SLgg/UjSxTIsZR6I/AAAAAAAAAPs/DbeAaLDZ18k/s1600/office-space-lazy-mode.png)This would only encourage me to work harder and be more loyal to the company. No, it's bloody well not okay to sing at work. Not everyone has a pleasant voice. This only works with people who *want* to work. The kind of people who want their work to always be top notch because they feel it's a reflection of them as a person. If you happen to find the rare office full of these people, then these kinds of policies provide the necessary freedom for the job to get done the most efficiently and at the highest quality.

In the countless offices and jobs where people are just there to collect a check, this absolutely does not work. And I'm not necessarily always blaming the employees. Some jobs are just shit and no one would ever *want* to work it. It just is what it is sometimes.Plot twist: This is an ad for Slack.Where I work the list would fit on a sticky note.

It's ok to......work, because that's what I'm paying you for. Now get back to work and stop wasting my money reading notes on the wall.Employees can be treated like people? I didn't know that was an option.I like the ""not check your email out of hours"" bit.

Nothing pisses me off more than getting hounded for not responding to emails, when I haven't had a chance to check them.

*walk into office*

""Hey, you never responded to my email.""

""When did you send it?""

""Last night, at around 7pm.""

""....correct, I didn't respond. I wasn't working at that time.""

*fast forward when someone complains about it*

""Part of your job expectation is that you check your email and respond promptly.""

""Okay, then show me that clause in my contract. Because I'm pretty sure my contract states that I'm supposed to do my job well, as instructed, and on time. Now if you want to add a 'must check email every few hours' clause to that contract, by all means, go for it; but, it better be accompanied by a higher wage.""

&nbsp;

Aaaaaaaand, while I'm on this rant:

""Hey, I'm still waiting on a response to that email I sent you.""

""You mean the email asking me <insert random question>?""

""Yes""

""Well, we had a one-on-one meeting about it. And *then,* the next day, you asked me about it in person again. I considered the question to be answered (twice) at that point. So no, I did not respond to the email (outside of work hours), because I considered it to be a waste of my time.""

""Well, I need written confirmation from you.""

""That's absolutely understandable, but if that's the case, DON'T FUCKING ASK ME ABOUT IT - *TWICE* - IN PERSON. Or at least have the forethought to say: ""hey, I know we already talked about this, but I'd just like written confirmation."" That's a little better - BIT EVEN SO: if you really need the written confirmation, then don't bother with the in-person questions. Send an email. Ask questions. Get answers. Boom - written confirmation, and we've both only had to address this issue one time. That means that we're not getting paid to waste time, and I'm not slowly hating you for asking the same question multiple times.

&nbsp;

Sorry guys - I could go on and on and on about this. Apparently I ""have a reputation for not responding to emails,"" and it just blows my mind. No one at my office seems to agree with my rules, which are as follows:

1) If you send an email during off-hours, expect a response during on-hours. 

2) If it is urgent, and cannot wait, call me. Even if it's to say ""hey, I know it's 8pm on a Saturday, but there's a serious situation that needs addressing. Are you available to check your email?""

3) If you ask me a question in person, do not ask me the same question in an email, unless you at least acknowledge that it is a follow up, and you just need confirmation.

Work hours are work hours. Off hours are off hours. I'm perfectly willing to spend some off-hours working from time to time, as it's something we all have to do now and then; however, do not expect me to be glued to my email, as if I have nothing better to do than to work for you while not getting paid.

&nbsp;

FUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKK

&nbsp; 

EDIT: Whoa! I don't know if this qualifies as ""RIP inbox,"" but I surely did not expect this many replies! A couple of responses that may put things into context:

&nbsp;

1) This is not a salaried position. I freelance (to an extent), so these are part-time office hours at this company. I *absolutely* agree that, if I were salaried here, then I should be less hostile about unnecessary emails, and way more appreciative of that fact that I'm pulling in a decent annual, completely stable and reliable income. 

2) Although I *do* believe in everything I said, and stand by it, I'm not really this hostile at the workplace. In comes Reddit, where I can enjoy writing up a fiery rant - the type that I would never actually display at the office (although I have made these opinions known, diplomatically)

3) Given that I really provided no information as to what I do, where I do it, or what my office situation is like, I totally sympathize with those of you who think I just hate my job, suck at it, don't put in any extra effort, and won't ""climb the ladder,"" (so to speak); however, it's probably worth noting that I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisors and coworkers, and though I have this reputation about emails, I also have a reputation for doing far more work than is required (and happily so, because I *do* believe in the company and its overall goals), as well as a reputation of going out of my way to help guide other workers in how to do their jobs more effectively. I love my job, but it is a small company, and because I believe in it, it sometimes feels like a full time gig - without the benefits. Perhaps that is why I get a little snarky about off-hours emails.

4) Lastly, the head of the company has almost always taken my side in this issue, and has complained to managers about sending six emails that could be consolidated into one, as well as trying to limit emails to office hours (when it's not an emergency). This was meant to be more of a Lewis Black style ""let me rant about this small thing!,"" rather than a ""my company is absolute shit for doing this to me."" (That being said, again, I stand by my reactions!)

&nbsp;

SECOND EDIT: and my gold cherry has been popped, it would seem. Obligatory thanks, kind strangerSeeing this makes me feel happy knowing that there are good employers out there, and simultaneously sad that I work in an exploitative hell-hole where most of the things on this list are *not* ok.Lots of people asking where this is, are they hiring, or saying it's made up...

It's from the team at the UK's Government Digital Service. 

https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/Judging by the comments here, inclusive workplaces aren't as common as I thought.  This is just basic respect for your employees, I'm bummed a lot of people think this is a weird idea.


Edit:  To clarify, I'm bummed that people are forced to work at places that reward presenteeism and conformity, as I was naiively under the impression that more workplaces understood that those aren't the best ways to get optimal results from your employees.  I wasn't saying that you're all fascists or a part of a major problem if this way of working is new to you.  There used to be a course on EdX by Catalyst about this kind of thing that is probably still available for audit if anyone is interested.Are they hiring?Irony - most people are reading this on Reddit at work.That looks like a cool building!The only explanation. They grow marijuana. Well this makes me sad about my job even more. Serious question. Am I the only one who wonders if I'm lazy, or just want more from my job than just a paycheck? Or am I alone in this one?file under: notes i'll never see at my jobit's ok to....

We always get snow every year in our mountains. Yesterday the snow level came down to around 2000 ft and that is more rare. Last time it did that was probably around 4-6 years ago. **Helpful tips for those that have never driven in snow:**

-don't slam on your brakes (additionally: check your car manual if your car requires brake pumping or not)

-before braking, let up the gas first for about 2 seconds before using the brake pedal

-increase your braking distance significantly compared to dry conditions. You will slide if you attempt to stop at what may seem a reasonable rate normally and lose control (thanks, /u/my_dog_is_cool)

-keep a cars length between you and driver in front of you when stopped

-if you know you are going or about to go over a bridge, don't accelerate or brake unless you need to (bridge ices before road)

-accelerate while going up hills

-don't ever break going up hills

-don't ever use cruise control

-if the light turns green before you approach the intersection (meaning you did not make a full stop yet), proceed with caution (someone from the previous light might still slip in the intersection on accident)

-look both ways when the light turns green before proceeding

-keep the top of your car free of snow (for drivers behind you)

-keep the hood of your car free of snow (for your benefit when that wind blows)

-put your emergency blinkers on the moment you are seriously stuck

-wear sunglasses during the daytime (you'll see outlines of curbs and medians better)

-never use your brights (it's like a million mirrors blinding you)

Zoom in and look at the sharks eyes. That's what a surprised shark looks like. That's a juvenile bull shark, so it will give you a nasty nip but is not really dangerous. They are in pretty much every river and residential canal estate in Australia. Bull sharks are born and grow up in fresh water, entering the ocean when they are grown, where they are indeed a bunch of dicks.

There are two types of croc in Australia: freshwater crocs (aka freshies), and saltwater crocs (aka salties). Brutus is a salty.

Determining the difference is easy enough. Simply jump into the river. If the croc quietly climbs out on the opposite bank and gives you a surly look, it's a freshie.

If the croc surges toward you, grabs your leg and pulls you under the water in a choas of flailing limbs, rolls around a few times and drowns you, then swims off and plants your body in a mud bank,  returning to take a bite from your rotting corpse every couple of days, then it was a salty.He stopped the shark from drowning. Brutus is a hero.Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine.

The signification of this attack is very strong. They wounded freedom.
Four cartoonists, they killed an economist too, Bernard Maris, I listened him on national radio ""France Inter"" on the morning.
RIPThe sad thing is that many have hoped media around the world would publish the cartoons that led to this tragedy. But what has actually happened is media blurring the cartoons in fear. Example from the Telegraph in the UK: http://i.imgur.com/lwcqqrY.png

Edit: Full context on the page: http://i.imgur.com/eYKGcaw.pngThe cartoonists are Cabu and Charb, but other people have been killed too, including cartoonists Wolinski and Tignous.

Here are some of their work:

[Charb](http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2015/01/07/1714196-b6v30sgcuaai-ol.jpg) - Translation: *No terrorist attacks in France so far* ; ""Wait! We have 'til the end of January to present our wishes/resolutions...""

[Wolinski](http://a404.idata.over-blog.com/500x479/2/31/51/01/758/Wolinski.gif) - Translation: the sign reads *Attack claimed by far-right extremists* ; Policemen: ""Walk slower, or we'll have no choice but to arrest them!"" ; Perpetrators: ""Walk faster, or they'll have no choice but to arrest us!""  
NOTE: Wolinski did very few policital drawings compared to his peers and was mostly known for his drawings on sexual perversion. I selected this drawing because a) it's the only political one I could find and b) it's one of the few that aren't NSFW.

[Tignous](http://marcsuivre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/caricature-tignous-islam1.jpg) - Translation: Man: ""You ought to cover yourself!"" ; Woman: ""Do you want it in the gabber, my Hand of Fatima?""[this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Wolinski) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignous) also, apparently. RIPThey apparently yelled that they were avenging Mohammed. What kind of god or prophet needs vengeance from a comic? These attacks don't show people's strength of conviction, they show the weakness of their beliefs. No one has ever strapped a bomb to their chest because of their belief in quantum mechanics or group theory.Between the majority of media's decision not to show these artists' works uncensored, and Sony caving to North Korea's (partially successful) attempt to prevent the release of The Interview, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the way our culture has caved to the violent, threatening tactics of fanaticism. Free-thinking nations should not be shriveling up like this in the face of hatred and oppression of thought. What a shameful time we live in.Jesus fucking christ, it's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated.

Side note: A connect-the-dots of ""TPM"" would be fun if it was directed at the proper websites. You know, I'm extremely liberal when it comes to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and open immigration, but even I think it's time for Europe to tell Muslim immigrants to assimilate or expatriate. You want to wear hijabs and preach in the street? Fine. Want to convert old, unused churches to mosques? Groovy, awesome way to preserve architecture. Want to offer Middle East studies and Arabic in schools? Capital idea! Want to hold open iftars? Save a slice of baklava for me. Want to issue death threats in public protests, carry out honor killings and establish sharia courts? Well have fun doing that in the stone age shitheaps where that nonsense still flies, but you can get right the fuck out of my civilized society if you're going to behave like an animal.Fuck that. I'm in tears. Sadness and anger boil inside.

Cabu (left) was an household name in France. Such a sweet, intelligent, strong guy. Participated in the children broadcasts we were all watching in the 80s. 

Let it be remembered that he lived and died as a hero of freedom.

And no, these aren't one-way roads. Speed at your peril. [Here's another](https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.218564,-6.147497&spn=0.000944,0.002926&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=53.218551,-6.147628&panoid=wK6lfG1bq8PTND5iOMjK0Q&cbp=13,265.91,,0,11.7). Also many drivers in Ireland don't consider this a ""speed limit"", but instead more of a suggested or required average.

""Well if it says 80, I better go 80"".

Prepare to be airborne for most of this lane.Back to boards.ie with ye, lads. The beginning of The Guard is good for an idea of what most roads are like. Black humour on the speed and the Guards in Ireland.rural roads in Ireland are the stuff of dreams if you enjoy driving, it makes you a better driver you have no choice about it :P
nothing scarier than being flat down a back road and seeing a tractor pulling out of a gap :P keep her country ;)Some people do drive far too quickly on those sorts of roads. I think often they're locals who assume that because they know every turn and bump on the road and drive it at speed every day nothing unexpected will ever happen.

Setting a speed limit for a local road like that is a matter for the local council. There is a [national review](http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0208/speed.html) of speed limits ongoing in Ireland at the request of the Minister for Transport. The aim is to bring them into line with guidelines circulated by the government in January 2011. It is, ironically, a very slow process.http://imgur.com/G4OXx

It's also probably a dual carriageway.Stick the Subaru logo in the corner and we've got ourselves a winning billboard advertisement.My brother drives very fast down country lanes a little wider than that in England. 

On a moonlit night he will turn his headlights off and drive even faster, to show how well he knows the roads, and say ""don't worry, if a car's coming the other way we'll see his headlights"" ... [brief pause] ... ""unless it's Dave. Dave likes to do this too"". And then he smiles. Being an American that's driven the majority of the Emerald Isle, I was constantly amazed at how ridiculous the speed limits were. I'd go maybe 20 km/h under the limit, feel I was going too fast and still have people up against my back bumper. Driving there is, in a word, insane.I learned to drive manual on vacation in Ireland.  Zipping around those roads in a tiny car was the most enjoyable driving experience of my life.    Taking the coastal road in Co Clare was gorgeous, and dodging the massive tour buses just added an extra challenge.  For safety of life and limb I preferred to stick to the R roads though.That's actually an old picture, there's a toll bridge just after the speed limit sign now. My friend went to Northern Ireland and tore the driver's side mirror off the rental car on one of these roads when meeting an oncoming truck. When he returned the car they were just like ""Yeah, that's what happens. Have a nice day.""As an Irishman I can assure you all that 80kph is a grand speed for this road. You don't even need to steer, those soft looking ditches on either side will gently nudge you back on track if you lose your way.Damn, I miss Ireland. 

Nice landscape & reasonable speed limits.

(Also, as a german, i must insist: 80 km/h != Autobahn !)Thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x84r.jpg) was pretty funny my first time there on those narrow roads.There's nothing more terrifying than when I'm in the passenger seat of my gf's car, and she takes he country roads out to Donegal and they're all exactly like this picture. We'll pass an 80kmph sign, and she'll turn to me with this evil grin like ""I'm gonna fuck you up!""

We're from N. Ireland where the roads laws are a bit more strict. I think Dara O'Brien but it best. 

In the UK there is Legal and Illegal. Righ and Wrong.
In the Republic of Ireland, there are 3 levels. 
1. That's Grand. 
2. Ah now, don't push it.
3. You're taking the piss.  One of my most vivid memories of Ireland is driving on a two-lane road the size of a shoulder on a cliff-side and having people whiz by at 80 km/h.WHOAH, here in spain the limit in not paved roads are 30km/h.

No really though this is the most impressive thing I've seen in forever.Senator Franken is sharp as anything, and actually an excellent senator.

Storytime: My mother was (recently retired) a teacher. She met the Senator about five, six years back when he came to her school to talk to the kids. He actually drew one of these in front of them as he talked. He then spent some time in the teacher's lounge talking to my mom. At the time, my father was in the process of dying of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, which they discussed.

He met her again a few years later, and asked after him (by name, mentioning the disease - didn't just file it away under ""random teacher - sick husband""), and gave his condolences. He remembered that shit the whole time, after one meeting. Didn't need to - he had her vote to begin with and he knew it - he's just got a memory like a freaking vice.

Either way still impressive as shit.Before he was a Senator, and after SNL he had a radio show.

I was crying and being a typical whiny 4 year old (I was also malnourished and dirty) and this one cop kept me company in the house while everyone else was outside discussing things. He read me a book and played with my stuffed animals with me, and we had a lot of fun. After I was removed from the home, he showed up at my court appearances for almost a year. Officer Clarke was a great guy. Cops like him, and this guy really set the standard for what it means to be a public servant. My father was a paramedic in the city for 30 years..he has never cut a dead body out of a seat belt.
Edit: thanks for the gold! To clarify, Every time my father has had to cut a seat belt, the person was alive. Seat belts save lives, so do helmets. I always wear my seat belt, even if I'm driving around the block, not because I don't trust my own driving,..but I don't trust anyone else.This is heartbreaking.  One of my biggest somewhat irrational fears is that they won't be able to find someone to quickly take care of my kids if something unexpectedly happens to me.  I imagine they'd be so confused and scared.  I hope they found this little girl's relatives quickly.This brings back so many memories from when I was 7- years-old. All 8 members of my family were on a road trip in a 7 passenger van all of us were wearing seatbelts except my 4-year-old brother, Jake, who was sitting in my 12-year-old sister's lap, Cara. It was morning and I was asleep in the front seat while my dad was driving. Next thing I know I wake up hanging in the air because the van had rolled and finally settled on the driver's side.

Everyone was out of the car already and my dad helped me climb out through the back of the van. As soon as I step out I see my oldest sister(17),Lynn, covered in blood and my 10-year-old sister, Jess screaming for someone to help Lynn. Someone guided me and Jess away from the accident and set us on a blanket facing an empty field. We moved to a truck when it started raining before riding in an ambulance with my mom and Jake on a stretcher.

The 5 of us who were wearing our seat belts properly walked away hardly any scratches. Lynn wasn't wearing her shoulder belt and went half way out the window and broke her clavicle and got around 40 staples in her leg and some stitches. She stayed in the hospital a few days and made a full recovery. 

Jake and Cara were the only ones not wearing seatbelts at all. They were ejected from the car together and Cara acted as a cushion for Jake and very likely saved his life. He needed some stitches but was fine otherwise. Cara died within minutes.

After the fact I learned that Cara had been wearing her seatbelt just minutes before the accident. Lynn had asked Cara to get something from the back and she and Jake were both leaning over the backseat at the time of the accident.

Don't even take your seatbelt off for a second.[deleted]""Police say the two adults and four kids in the SUV were not properly restrained. All of them were ejected in the crash.""

OK. This is terrible but if you can't use your fucking seat belts to protect your family...People please wear your damn seat belt!! I just pulled a guy out of his over turned Ford Taurus in front of my house that had flipped 4 times Monday of this week who survived because he was wearing his seat belt. If he hadnt been im almost positive he wouldve been dead easily. It is in the car for a reason!Some years back I rear ended another driver. Slammed into the back of their car at about 50mph. We all walked away okay. My airbag and seatbelt kept me okay. I ended up with a small burn on my arm from the airbag. Apparently even the officer told me it was a high accident area.

Now recently I was getting ready to head to Disneyland with my inlaws and infant son. We're getting ready to get into the car and I noticed the number of people(5 adults and an infant) and their car is a five seater. I asked if we we're taking two cars and they said the baby was going to ride on somebody's lap. I was a wee bit pissed and put my foot down. My son rode in his car seat and we crammed three adults in the back seat. If they want to risk their safety that's fine. But like Hell I was going to let them risk my son's.[deleted]It's 2015. How in the actual hell are people still not using seatbelts? I don't even realize that I'm putting it on - it's just a reflex as is putting the keys in the ignition. You really have to make a conscious decision to not put your seatbelt on. I don't feel like it's something that you just forget to do. If I'm not buckled in, I feel that everything is horribly wrong.Here's a story I don't like telling much, but maybe it will convince somebody.

When I was 18 or 19, I lived overseas near an American air base in Germany and worked on base.  Every morning, I would leave for work later than I should have, and speed the whole way through these little villages and country roads.  If you've ever driven in Pennsylvania or other states in the area, kinda like that.

Near the base, there was a big blind corner that was pretty fun to go fast on, hugging the inside.  I did this hundreds of times, usually bleary-eyed and tired in the morning from staying up too late on AOL talking to this girl.  No big deal, the road was wide enough and there was rarely any traffic in the morning.

Then, one particular morning, I went around that curve and saw a woman in the street waving her arms.  I slowed down, and as I was doing so, I saw the car on its roof off to the left, and a body in the road about fifty yards ahead.  I pulled over, put my blinkers on, got out the warning triangle and first aid kit and ran over to the arm waver. I was the second person on the scene.

The obvious conversation happened, and I called whatever the 911 equivalent was over there, spoke broken English to some German guy, and then went to see what I could do about the woman in the street.

Her car was on its roof, and it was still running.  Something was playing on the radio and the exhaust pipe was emitting exhaust.  It was cold enough that you could see the exhaust. I turned the car off, and went back to the woman.  I have no useful medical training beyond some very basic first aid and a lapsed CPR certification, so all I could do was talk to her and put my coat and some emergency blankets on her.  She obviously had a head wound and was in and out of almost-consciousness. It had been drizzling, so the road was damp.  Her head was bleeding.  I can still see the water on the road mixed with her blood, and the dirt and rocks pressed in to the skin of her face, where her sweater was ripped on her shoulder, and the scratches on her skin.

Time passes.  No emergency services.  By this time I'd stopped traffic and spoken to the arm-waver about what had happened.  She'd seen it.  The victim went around the corner at the same time as a big truck coming the other way.  The truck was over the line a bit, and she over-corrected, flipped, and was ejected.

Called 911 again.  Same kind of conversation.  A little bit of time passes.  Finally this guy runs up with a baby in his arms.  He's her husband and got stuck in the traffic jam caused by his wife's accident.  He walked up to see what was going on and found out.  There's nothing he can do either.  Some emergency services from the base finally show up after somebody else had called, and they start doing their thing.  Those of us who are close enough to the scene are told to drive away and leave so that a helicopter can land soon.  I take my coat back, drive to work, and wash the blood off of my hands and my phone, and hide in the back for a little while so I can compose myself.

I had nightmares for about a month after that.  Not because of what I had seen really, but because if I had been maybe five or ten minutes earlier, if I was the first one on the scene and hadn't been stopped by the arm-waver, I probably wouldn't have been able to stop in time.  With wet roads like that, I probably would have driven over the victim in the road as I realized what was happening.  You can imagine what my dreams were about.

So, pay attention, and wear your goddamn seatbelts.
My friend, In a church group, got in a car accident in a head on collision going 55. Every person, except her, wasn't wearing their seat belt. Her mother, father, and 5 others were ejected from the vehicle. 3 people including her mother died, her father was a paraplegic and everyone else had severe injuries. She had a broken arm and some bruising. Seat belts save your your fucking life. This man can prove it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp""... Look for the helpers. You will always find people that are helping.""  - Mr. RogersNo matter how bad my day at the office is, I'm fucking glad I don't have to do this shit.This is one of the most heartbreaking photos I've ever seen.Wow. The most heroic thing I did today was smile at a dog.My wife responds that these kinds of calls about twice a week. Lately she has had her car spit on because of the immediate assumption that all cops are evil and want to shoot everyone. 

Yet she does stuff like you see in the photo for a living. Last week she went to two separate child deaths from crashes. Slightly different scenario but I want to give a shout out to one Officer Barcus, who helped distract me, a 28 year old graduate student, after I walked in and found my father had shot himself in the head at his house. As I was the only legal next of kin there (my mom was there but she was divorced from my dad) I had to wait for the Coroner to sign paperwork. On the worst day of my life, this cop talked to me, asked me about what I was studying, and basically kept me from just completely freaking out. This was 20 years ago. It's often the smallest things that make the biggest difference. Fuck this hits home. Medic here. I've had some truly heart wrenching calls. One of which was a father who had taken his young daughter quadding with him. Rolled his quad and broke his neck.  His daughter sat with him for close to three days if I remember correctly. She was 5 or 6. Kept telling us to be quiet because daddy was sleeping. 

I've never cried on call before, but how do you explain to a child that young that daddy isn't sleeping. Daddy is dead. 

I went home and hugged my sister that night.This isn't cop stuff, this isn't man stuff or dad stuff... This is fucking real people stuff. Real human shit.Sauce -
http://www.9news.com/story/news/traffic/2015/06/18/i-76-closed-due-to-crash/28926321/For all the horrific stories about cops killing people, I worked for many years as a civilian crisis worker for LEOs.  People often don't understand how police are exposed to horrific circumstances and emotions that are 'just part of the job.'  For all the WTF and watchpeopledie subreddits here, police often see this stuff first hand.  Crime and accident scenes attack all the senses-- decaying bodies are one thing, but even the smell of blood and gore indoors is something that cannot be described.  It is much more intense than just seeing a photo on reddit.

I dealt with three cases that still haunt me.

1-  A cop responded to a dead baby in a home.  A mother just had taken her newborn home, was exhausted, fell asleep, rolled over, and smothered her baby.  Later, after that situation was handled, the same cop was called out to the interstate where there was a report of a dead deer in the road.  The same mother had jumped from an overpass at night, and was basically just a stain on the asphalt.  That cop had a very bad shift.

2-  A dead baby at a day care.... I'll skip the details here, but going through a debrief with a bunch of weeping police officers was very intense.  

These stories never made the news.

The third story happened more than 10 years ago, and it is still being litigated, and has been in the national media.  I will skip the details other than to say it involved a horrific mutilation in a public bathroom.... and a hysterical, surviving mother.  Everyone attached to the case was deeply affected for years.  I had a first responder reach out to me this week---- years later, to discuss the case.

I have a close friend who was a homicide detective.  It sucks driving around town with her, since everywhere she goes she points out, we had a murder there, a shooting there, a suicide there, etc.

It seriously does something to people, and they tend to become desensitized to many things as a coping mechanism.  It taints their world view to be exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, and they deal with life and death (mostly unnecessary death) on a regular basis.  I am not a police apologist, as I find it horrible how police in the US have become militarized.  But there is a reason some cops treat everyone like animals.

What I find sad is that many police don't have what it takes to work effectively with the general public.  They may have had it at one point, but it can disappear.  The profession should do a better job at psych screening.  It isn't that different than the PTSD people/soldiers get in war zones.  Even the 'Barney Fifes' working in rural areas are seeing brutal killings of 80 year old women in meth related cases, or horrific issues of child neglect.Thanks for helping show the good cops, OP.I could never be a police officer.

Imagine that kind of shit just being part of your fucking day. Once they were done at that crash site, that officer holding the child had to go do fucking paperwork.

How could you possibly get on with your day after distracting a newly-orphaned little boy/girl from the sight of their dead parents a handful of metres away?

My uncle was in hospital for a long time, and it was striking that the hospital in Scotland would spend so much money on fancy equipment, and nothing on small things which would improve the stay one-hundred fold.

An example: they had high-tech beds with televisions, and telephones, but they didn't have an engineering contract to service them, so noone could use them. My uncle was an engineer and planned to donate his services when he got out, but he never did. This is fantastic. I have always wanted to have this done at our nonprofit but never knew how to go about it. One day I will figure it out. Thank you for donating your time and doing this to help bring people a smile.

I'm more than sure that by making this murals you are doing more than covering blank sterile walls, people there really need as much support as they can have, and this is the little kind of things that helps a lot.

Thank you, very much.That is absolutely lovely... Your heart is a good one. We are recurring patients to the pain and palliative care war. My wife has a chronic pain condition that puts her in for about a week a year. Thank you so very much. These sorts of touches make an enormous difference.

Flash forward a few decades and a renovation in that spot created a room that needed a window for Cleveland building code reasons. Now there is a window.Cleveland baby! Knew I recognized it, then zoomed in and was reassured. In the spirit of ""I want a god damn window"" I like to imagine the common office worker, coming in on a weekend with an appropriate rented saw and just did the hole himself, patched up a cheap window in there, cleaned up everything and came back on monday to his ordinary office, which is now the only one with a window.It almost looks like another building use to be attached to that one? Or could it just be a shadow... No biggie, that's just room 1408.  OSHA regs. That's the fire escape.Sniper perch.I knew that building looked familiar, Clevelander for life :3One of the cool things that gets glossed over about Cleveland is that each of the buildings are old enough to carry some history. It may not be the caliber that Europe has, but over 100 years of development and change isn't paltry either. 

One of the defining statements of major cities these days are skyscrapers. If you think about it skyscraper technology isn't that old, only exploding in the past 50 years or so. 50 years ago, Cleveland was a fully functioning, top 10 US city. There was really no need to build up a brand new huge building (and you couldn't really). Excluding a few buildings in NYC, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in the world for 20 years and the US for 30. 

Unfortunately by this time the companies and jobs that made up Cleveland were being moved elsewhere and any new developments were quickly cancelled. That combined with the invention that is the air conditioner and Cleveland slowly lost it's status. We were still a top 10 city in 1970 which wasn't *that* long ago.

Regarding these tourism videos, yes I am from Ohio and I do currently live in Cleveland (what makes you think I'm biased?). I remember when these videos came out and laughing at how spot on they were. To some extent they still are. HOWEVER. Things are looking up and a lot of new social places are opening up. We've getting back into the skyscraper phase with a nice hotel that'll hopefully be ready for the RNC (it will but nothing will work). And finally, if this nuCLEus project goes forward, it'll be interesting to see what else spawns from that. 

Will Cleveland ever return to status it used to have? No, least not in any reasonable time frame. It's cold and that's something we can't change and compete with. Cleveland does have a distinct advantage of not having to worry about natural disasters. So who knows, maybe in 300 years we'll be relevant again.I hope he's happy now, watching the world through his tiny little window.Plot twist, it's a broom closet.MedianerasMy dad used to know a guy that worked at the broadcast control room at the top of the CN Tower.  The room was all [concrete walls, blaring cooling fans, and TV signal displays.](http://www.roadwolf.ca/files/blogpics/CNTower/94538.jpg)  He said he was getting miserable, possibly S.A.D., from never seeing the sunlight.

So he asked management about installing a single porthole window.  He pressured them enough that they actually bothered to look into it, and they said it would cost $20,000, and that they were willing to pay for half if he paid for the other half.  Never did get the porthole installed.

Guy had some cool stories though.  Like [the Northeast Blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) - he said you could see the power rolling out from block to block - it didn't just all immediately shut off at once, it moved like a wave in the ocean.  Of course, he didn't have his camera.

He also got us in the CN Tower for free, through the basement security entrance, and we got to see the cool control room at the top of the tower that visitors can't see.  

EDIT: Since folks are interested, I'll share this cool photo:

/sorrynotsorryWindow seat is awesome. I can't even fall asleep on the plane ride because I'm too concentrated on staring out the window. Still fascinating no matter how many times I fly. 

The best ones are if the plane has a window exit. Fun fact, a lot of wide body aircraft say ""window exit"" but that seat actually has the window like 2-3 feet in front of the seat and maybe a foot behind it. So, tall people of reddit, make sure to ask if the exit seat actually has a window. Especially if you fly on a 777-300ER.

Getting old is weirdIs that the remains of the evil, green demon that crashes planes?I hadn't been on an airliner since before 9-11, but I had to take the short flight from Los Angeles to Oakland on Southwest at the New Year. I am a geologist so I try to get a window seat to look at the familiar features on the ground in California, the San Andreas fault and the various ranges and structures one can see, especially when the sun angle is low. So I could see things like the Kettleman Anticline and the strike ridges of the Great Valley Sequence on the west side of San Jouquin Valley as we flew north. When we got about 20 min. out of Oakland the plane started to descend into the clouds and I thought that the show was over, but then I noticed a white colored bow that appeared opposite the sun in the clouds with a white spot in its center that I judged to be exactly opposite the sun which was low in the sky. As looked, and this lasted only a minute or so, I could see the shadow of the aircraft appear in the spot. Then we got deeper into the clouds and the effect was lost. I was seeing a glory and it may be reasonably common. I may have seen one years ago when I flew to Europe.

They are designed to be used in a specific way (straight through cutting using the disc edge) but they are frequently used incorrectly (such as grinding using the face of the disc) which can lead to this sort of failure, with high speed shrapnel spraying in every direction.  Even if used properly, if you don't pay attention and the kerf closes on the blade, thus binding it up, you will get a rapid unplanned disassembly of the disc.

I'm actually  impressed with peoples increased awareness and use of safety glasses, hearing protection, helmets and other gear even if NOT required.

So remember kids, 15 seconds of putting on safety gear can save you a lifetime of injury.  Now you know.  And knowing is half the battle.   *oh, damn cartoons*Wow I have an angle grinder and I'll never use it without glasses ever again.

That's terrifying.Although I have no experience with cutting discs such as this, I do vividly recall a few years ago using a table saw for the first time. I did not have proper instruction nor did I review of how to use it, had a piece of wood kick back and hit me right in the stomach.

I don't play around with tools anymore, I rigidly stick to the safety instructions and refuse to use a tool without understanding it better first. Could have avoided a nice punch to the gut had I just taken 10 to 15 minutes that day. Could be a lot worse depending on the tool you're using.I work in a Cnc grind shop with few conventional machines and shit like this gives me nightmares.

Visitors who don't know New York history sometimes assume it's all a carefully preserved green space from before the city existed, but that's not at all the case. Central Park was consciously conceived, laid out, and constructed beginning in the 1850s in response to the need for city-dwellers to have a place to ""escape"" to, and while it incorporated a few vacant spaces, much of it was reclaimed ground covered with temporary dwellings. Central Park is one of the great monuments to deliberate urban planning, most of it the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.

Edit: I'm not accusing OP of removing the watermark, but I do know it is in fact my friend's photo and would like to give her the credit she deserves. Help support her photography!

Edit 2: From /u/RunTheTrap

""She originally uploaded it to her National Geographic account here:

http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/photos/6577920/

It also was featured in this Editors' Spotlight post:

http://yourshotblog.nationalgeographic.com/post/128027447864/top-shot-the-great-divide-top-shot-features

She seems to have added the watermark on later, but it is her photo.""[Central park is just so awesome](http://www.christianross.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/central-park-from-above-nyc-satelatie-sky2.jpg) I got the impression from movies that Central Park is some tiny overcrowded and dimly lit patch of grass in the middle of a metropolitan, until I checked Google Maps. It's fucking *massive*.How much would it cost to rent one of those townhouse looking homes?Central park is much bigger than I realized. 
Edit: spelling... New York is a magnificent. Hi Everyone! I am Kayte Dolmatch - the photographer of this image. I'd like to clear a few things up:
1) This is my image and only my image
2) The very first time this was posted anywhere was on my flickr page with my watermark on November 20th 2014. https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaytedolmatch/15647565470/in/album-72157627317857063/ 
3) I submitted the photo to National Geographic in August of 2015 as part of an assignment ""From Above"". National Geographic prefers users to upload images without a watermark so I removed the watermark on the file I uploaded to their site.
4) To my pleasant surprise my image was voted Top Shot on National Geographic Your Shot - which meant it got ""published"" on their instagram and their blog (tumblr). This is the unwatermarked version that people have been stealing and posting all over the internet.
5)I have no problem with my image being circulated as long as the proper credit is provided - I'm so pleased that so many are touched by this photograph and really enjoy it.
6) I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark III, which allows the artist to record their name as the artist on every single image taken with the camera - this is captured in the metadata. Also seen on my flickr link
7)If you are interested in purchasing a print of this image please feel free to contact me at kathleendolmatch@yahoo.com
8) Thank you for reading this. Have a lovely day

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that ""stealing"" is not the correct term and I agree. ""Sharing without citing""  would have been more accurate. My image has gone viral on multiple websites without proper citation and I was frustrated when I made my original post. By the way, the apartment building in the center of the image with the gray gabled roof and green features is The Dakota, where John Lennon lived and was killed. Directly across in the park is an area called Strawberry Fields.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DakotaI miss my home :(Central Park is what makes Manhattan bearable, in my opinion.

It is the epitome of the need for escape from the urban cityscape and into the greenery, surrounded by two of my favourite museums, a one stop shop for getting away from the craziness that can be the city.Just went to central park for the first time yesterday. I found it to be an absolute gem among the massive concrete jungle that is NYC. The fact that they planned this over a
150 years ago and no one has either tried or been able to develop that land into more monstrous buildings is amazing. Central Park is probably my favorite place on Earth besides my bedJust a little fun fact, the lake in central park was originally a water reservoir for the NYC water supply. In Rio De Janiero, Christ the redeemer and the favelas have an interesting juxtaposition as well.So much beauty on the left. So much money on the right.I love to find  interesting buildings in New York. Look them up on google earth. Then look at the history behind them. How busy is Central Park on an average day? I cant imagine it supporting all those people...I love living in L.A. and I think it just might be one of the best cities in the world, but I wanna visit New York one day!  It seems like an awesome place to live !I really need to get to NY with my camera one day :(The demarcation is unbelievable. You can go in five minutes from being overrun by people to basically being alone in a forest. Ah, must be where the biome changes. Honestly, if you haven't been to New York yet, you should go just to visit.

Fucking kids these days. When I was a kid I *knew* how to get in troubleI threw a Halloween party at my house in college once, 300some people showed up (we had a big house and a big fenced in yard)  It was wild, DJs, bouncers, girls dancing on the bar, 3 floors of madness.  It was awesome.

Well at about 2am the cops showed up in full force expecting to have to chase down tons of underage drinkers and drug users.  Thankfully we prepared.  When the cops showed up we had the 2 ""bouncers"" greet them and texted us that it was time to break up the time. 

I got on the DJ's mic and told everyone that the cops were here and wanted the party to end, but they didn't want trouble.  So I urged everyone to NOT run, as it creates a panicky atmosphere where cops and students are freaking out.  

All the students left, no arrest or citations, and even though I was underage, the cops left us with a verbal warning.  The head officer then came to me, shook my hand, and said great party and thanks for ending it so calmly.

We got to party like animals for 5 hours and it had 0 negative outcomes.


*TL'DR - cops like a good party as much as the next guy, and thanked us for ending it when they asked in a responsible manner*I love being Canadian.Why couldn't they just let them turn down their music? This is actually amazing.In high school my friends and I threw a graduation party with no alcohol. All the partiers were either in some music department or taking AP classes and headed to college next fall. 

We had the cops come into the backyard because of noise complaints/possible drinking/typical suburban problems. The first conversation they heard was about Cello and what it takes to play at a collegiate level between me and my friend. 

Literally the words the cops said to us were, ""oh we can see you kids are  having fun, try to keep it down your neighbors are worried."" 

That was a fun summer. memories. [Expectation](http://i.imgur.com/DyO8lrw.jpg)

Like, throw another party, have the music bumping loud enough for the neighbors to get bothered by the bass, and get the cops called again.

Outside, we had a huge banner hanging from the side of the building ""HONEYMOON JACUZZI SUITES! FREE BOX OF CHOCOLATES AND BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE!"" So we'd get these newlyweds coming in, and they were handed  a 3.16oz bottle of champagne, a four-piece box of cheap chocolates, and it wasn't a Jacuzzi hot tub, but a Jacuzzi bathtub. I didn't work there for very long because I refused to sell the package. We had one guy get so angry, he jumped the counter, grabbed a bunch of chocolates and bottles of champagne, and left with his bride. Didn't even stay at our hotel.

I mean it has very nice seating, but that is about it.

The tv and the projector screen are rather small, there are skylights and these strange candles in the front. It might be some sort of stage or chapel or something. It looks more like some place where someone would give a sales pitch about some amazing multi-level marketing opportunity or a sermon about how much god wants you to give the preacher money.http://i.imgur.com/GhFBRxh.gifThat is AWFUL.

http://imgur.com/I3A3CC0,rm8HPW4#0Now all we need is someone from reddit to draw Lisa utilizing all of the no's.I just finished studying animation and even on our final student films the directors of each project were encouraged to make sheets like this. Our teams were really tiny, only 5 or 6 people a project, but when you have multiple people animating on a film, all with their own distinct styles and artistic background, it's pretty easy for inconsistencies to happen unless you really peg things down! 

Even in a small team like ours, the style guide basically became like our bible during the project, I can't imagine what it'd be like in larger teams, if style guides weren't there! I love seeing ones from other series though, some of the do's and don't's are really interesting, things you wouldn't notice/think about otherwise It takes a little while to hammer out all these kinks and standardize the art style across the animation team. If you want to see an example of some of these errors in play, check out the first season of Family Guy, there are a few errors, but one that immediately comes to mind is the cutaway where Peter thinks Philadelphia with Tom Hanks is a comedy. When the POV switches from zoomed out to closeup, someone didnt scale the eyes correctly, so for a part of the scene Peter's eyes are huge As an animator, seeing everyone's reaction to something that is super common in the industry is cool. It's like ""oh ya, what I do is pretty cool""I played around with the image to see what was written on the back. Here are my results (someone more skilled would do better):

Edit: Obligatory gold edit! Thank you to whoever gilded me for my first time!! :)I lost my grandma this morning unexpectedly. We were discussing last night what was one thing she had to do sooner than later. She wanted to lay on the beach and watch the 'hunks'
She was so funny. I'll miss her. This picture makes me happy! I'm glad she has people that care for her. 

Edit: My highest rated comment by FAR.If you wanted I bet you could find someone to photoshop that bag off her knee - I dont mean to imply that it's bad, just if you wanted it gone I've seen some great photoshop jobs here on reddit. 

awesome picture tho, I hope she's currently as comfortable as possible. Good on you for doing this for your grandma OP, the smile on her face is proof how much she appreciates you doing this for her.

As a nurse I work with a lot of patients who are terminally ill and frequently I'll ask them what were the most memorable moments in their life. 9/10 times people will mention family or memorable moments like these. Never once have I had a patient mention money or personal possessions as the highlight of their life. It's the little things in life that matters, make them count.The most simple pleasures of life can mean a lot to some. Doctor here. This is the way it should be. Dying with dignity versus the medical torture we sometimes use to prolong the inevitable. Love the joy on her face. Congratulations to her for a long life. This is such a touching pic.  It brought both tears to my eyes as well as happiness seeing that smile on her face.  She looks like the Grandma everyone would want around them.  Sending big hugs to you and your gram.Wat.When my uncle came home from hospital to die (he didn't want to stay in the hospice, so his wife and my mother cared for him during his final 3 weeks. His bed was set up in the sitting room, his view out the window was onto the mountain range in our area. He woke up to the sun rising every morning over it. During the day and in the evenings his bed was wheeled out into the kitchen so he could be there with his family and be beside the stove. He could lie there and look out the double doors onto the bay. The view from the kitchen over the bay is unbelievable, many people at the funeral in the house were amazed at it. 
Before his remains left the house to go to the church we faced him towards the sea one last time. Something I believe would have put a smile on his face. Happy watFuck yeah grandson! Not only are you sharing that fantastic day with her, and making her final desires a reality, you are there. And her face shows the joy and wonder of the setting and experience with you! 

To this day I regret missing my stepfathers final days, due to work commitments and travel constraints. All in all bullshit rationalizations. I just missed his death by @ 6 hours. Regret not being there just to say goodbye, hold his hand and thank him for everything he was to me. So kudos, it's hard to watch it happen, but being there for our loved ones is soul work. It is our responsibility and great honor to help them pass from this world to...

Edit: For assumptions about OP's gender!Is this San Diego?

As someone who works in SD in some palliative/ home hospice care settings please listen to me when I say

You're all doing the right thing for her. HOSPICE DOES NOT MEAN YOURE GIVING UP ON SOMEONE. 

Edit: a wordHer joy is breathtaking. I have never loved a photo as much as I love this one!This totally looks like Laguna Beach. We need closure, op!I hope you grandma goes peacefully, remembering wonderful moments like this one.My G'ma knew her time was near and wouldn't my wedding so I made her her favourite dinner and proposed to my wife in front of her so she could be a part of our wedding [Dignity](http://i.imgur.com/XGIr4do.jpg)This made my heart smileI love this so much. I'm a geriatric nurse and its sad the number of elderly people who don't have family or don't have family who care enough to do things like this for them. You guys are awesome :)Op, was that wheelchair rented or how did you find it?  I may be trying to take my mother-in-law to see the beach for the first time next year and worry about her walking on the sand.

Thanks.

It's not all bad though, the area is being regenerated and there's new housing and a new school now.It's a great shame to see communities like this lost from towns and cities across England but unfortunately it's a result of the times we live in. 

I live in Liverpool City centre and a comparison of the city centre 39 years ago and how it is today would produce an equally surprising yet positive contrasting image. The city Centre is amazing and is a credit to the hard work done by Liverpool City council.

NeatIce.... Cave... under a Volcano?... sounds like a death trap.This reminded me there was some pseudo-scence attempt in some website somewhere to explain how dragons would be and they were apparently made of carbon fiber that would allow them to have hollow bones like birds, so they'd be light without losing durability to allow flying. They'd have a sack of methane or some gas in their stomach which they would spark with a specialized lighter-like organ in their throat that would allow it to breathe fire.

Edit: And if you want to compare the glasswork to the original:

http://i.imgur.com/SHUEeBq.jpg""each slice sold for $5000? Jesus, it's just glass! Slap an art tag on a pile of shit and I could sell it I bet!""

*opens link*

""oh.. Yeah, 5k sounds fair.""Every time I read a description about an art form I always think- ""cool something for me to try""
I have to pretend I never saw this nowProfessional glass artist here. This is how it's made:

The artist will pull very long strands of glass in all the colors that required for the picture he wants to make. They then arrange the long strands of glass into say a face or a foot or something. then melt them all together and pull that very long again. Then you can take the face you made and add that 'face' strand to a whole bunch of other strands to make an overall picture.

tldr: it's just like using one pixel at a time to make up the whole image.[deleted]Yeah yeah yeah that's real neat and all but you can't even smoke weed out of it.  Fantastic stuff! I love this.Cut it thinIs there a discount for the end piece?how do they slice this?Calling these things slices makes me want to eat one.If you're interested in glass art, there are two really good subreddits for it. /r/glassheads and /r/lampwork are both full of amazing glass art, artisits, and a copious amount of knowledgeable people in the art.In the future, the one who can collect all the pieces and join them together will be granted a wish.

Snow plows running every week, signs getting blown off buildings, flickering lights, snowing in October and May, rain clouds that looked like armageddon. They were beautiful, though. Like the people from Independence Day looking up at those ships in awe as the beam gradually forms and decimates everything.As a South Dakotan I love whenever my state gets some attention everyone from there likes to jump in and chime Oooh Im from South Dakota! We are an awesome little big state.I like the look of the photo, but I wonder how green that really is because I have seen skies that have that eerie sea green that I just know hail is coming my way.  The midwest is a terrifyingly beautiful part of America.I have experienced one of these South Dakota summer storms, probably around about this time of year, too. We were camping in Badlands NP. Temps had reached 116 that day, too hot and humid to move. That night, the bellowing wind bent the tent sideways; after we'd held it up from the inside for what seemed like an hour, we made a run for the car, sleeping bags in tow. From there we were witness to an almighty thunderstorm, lightning striking all over the visible sky, as a backdrop of 80s rock songs played on the car radio. The storm finally passed around 6am, and we returned wearily to our tent, which had somehow survived. It was terrifying at the time, but made for an amazing adventure for two Brits not used to such monumental storms! We loved our time in and around the Black Hills.*What a glorious day!*Yay! More comments/upvotes here than people who actually live in South Dakota with me! PEOPLE HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME PLS HALP COME KEEP US 5 COMPANY.This is one of the reasons I've never moved out of South Dakota.  44 years old and ive lived here all of those.the Nothing is coming!Title: and God said unto them ""get FUCKED South Dakota!""That's some shit straight out of Revelations. Or, as they call it in SD, Tuesday.The everstorm approaches. Did you crop out part of this?I can see why more people fear god there. And in Northwest Florida...  

http://i.imgur.com/bhfkUWB.jpgPretty sweet photo. [Here's one from a couple a years ago I took](http://i.imgur.com/3b1wxsf.jpg). If I remember right this is the storm that hit Wessington Springs with a tornado.Oh look, it's a you're-super-fucked-cellthats one hell of a Highstorm Obviously over-processed natural events are the bad silicone breast implants of the photo world.

I've seen countless Great Plains storms over many years, from Texas to Canada, at humidity level extremes and in all seasons, and not a single one ever displayed heavy-handed unsharp masking or color saturation.

The damn things are terrifyingly magnificent as-is.  Dressing them up with clown makeup is not only unnecessary, it's weirdly *insulting.*

Interesting.Note to self: find a desert map for Cities Skyline.Those look to be the upper middle class suburbs, they tend to be on the outskirts of Vegas away from the strip since they overlook the desert mountains. High schools get built onto empty dirt lots and homes surround the area. Unfortunately, most of these homes get built around the outer edges more and more each year with less and less people buying them out. I'm only 23 and most of my friends have been able to *buy* these homes at this age from how cheap they are. I'm a Vegas Native and I can safely say this is only a specific view of suburban Vegas life. I'd even say Vegas has many different kinds of suburban looks since the city keeps growing immensely every year.

*edit from mobile* so thanks to savvy Vegas friends below this has been identified as the Aliante portion of Vegas, which is definitely a way nicer suburb of Vegas. I didn't meant to imply that these homes are foreclosing, but lots of neighborhoods that look like this one nearby are affordable to younger folks like me. Looks like future mars.Nuketown[deleted]Made of ticky tacky.Question for those that have lived in Vegas.

 In my many trips to Vegas I've noticed that most of the neighborhoods have brick walls built around them, why is that?Reminds me of ""The Goldfinch"".  [deleted]Lots of comments from people saying Vegas sucks. I've been out here 10 years. It's fine. Every city sucks if you're looking for reasons for it to. It's just like any other place. Many of the complaints apply to any major city. Drivers suck, drug problems, crime, people are ""fake"" blah blah blah. I don't drink, do drugs, party, etc anymore. I have a decent career and life out here in this ""party town"". It's all about how you look at it. I think the desert is beautiful. Yeah, it gets hot as hell. It's a desert. We also don't have to shovel snow. This winter was cold for like a week in late December. Other than that, nothing more than a light jacket was ever needed. 

All of that being said, don't raise kids here unless you can put them in private school. Clark County schools are atrocious. Even if they graduate high school (~30% won't), the curriculum is so weak that they will still be at a disadvantage. Especially in an out of state university.

I have desert landscaping. Grass is dumb in the desert. Even outside of being a waste of water and contributing to the humidity, it just doesn't look right in the middle of the desert. I sure as shit don't want to be outside cutting the grass when it's 115 degrees out.This looks exactly like the homes in Las Ventura's in San Andreas in GTA: San Andreas.I live there. AMAI live in a similar neighborhood on the south west end of Las Vegas.  It's kind of nice and weird knowing that across the street there is literally nothing but desert for hundreds of miles.https://www.google.com/maps/@36.3090064,-115.1967351,1475m/data=!3m1!1e3

Location on map.fuck i belong in vegas. I'm a dirt bike freak, trails are hard to come by in Toronto, Canada... Ah, this picture reeks of corporate interests and government unwillingness to stand up against the corporations. Notice how the colour of the area outside the suburbs is faded, signifying the death throes of Mother Nature herself. The grey, uniform tops of the houses signify the victory of the corporate agenda and the defeat of the common person, who is now powerless to stop the overreach of the 1%.Looks just like my sim city. If you've got a good set of illegal binoculars, you can even see those dastardly fools over in Desert Bluffs.This is right next to Shadow Ridge High School. I bought my car from a guy near here.Reddit is weird. Space colonies are the future but trying to live in the desert is arrogant and unsustainable.Ahh a good case study for gridding in Cities Skyline.Honestly this does not look so bad.

I would rather grow up there than my own city.

Imagine being an 8-14 year old kid there with a giant desert behind your house to explore, build bike trails, jumps and just wander.

also there is an airport near on the bottom left corner to watch planes land and take off.

Then at 16 with a summer job and saving up allowances I'd get a small dirtbike to tour around in the desert.

Seriously, this place looks 10x better than growing up in other cities where you are locked in on 4 sides with shitty bylaws setup by old women city councilors.

Also, the current strategy for increasing power production is just to make them bigger. They're currently planning on making blades 60-something meters long. 

And it's a total pain to make/have made because you need a massive factory floor to make them since they can't make a strong enough modular designs currently.

Damn. You made the rain your bitch.Channel it to a neighbors yard? ;)Unless you live in Colorado. Nice!  Do you have more pics?That is a great idea! Now do mine.Cool! Where in California is this again?Nice mosquito trench.It looks a bit like a rain garden. The function of a rain garden is to increase infiltration rates and prevent runoff. They can also act to filter out pollutants. It's hard to tell by this angle but it looks like the intent is not to just run water from the downspouts to the pavement. 

Overall I like it. It probably helps reduce runoff and increase water infiltration. We should all build these in our yards to improve the water quality of our streams and rivers. Could use more deep rooted plants in it to make it better. 

Also as a side note, the city I live in will reimburse half the costs of a rain garden up to a certain amount. I bet many other towns do the same and few people know it. This looks awesome and yes it is the oldest method of irrigation! Am I the only person that thinks the pipe looks like an upside down bendy straw?Y'all have them cool porches I like. What state is this?Very beautiful. Thank you for the share gave me some ideas. Just wished it rained more in California. 
Nice way to do so.Omg that is beautiful!  I'm stealing this.  It's mine now.I collect mine in barrels and pour them on the gardens as needed.

And she'll be happy to see some affirmation of this memory's existence in time, a photograph somehow as beautiful as the memory itself. Beautiful. GET TO THE CHOPPAReal solid framing of your daughter under the rainbows! The perspective distortion from the wide-angle lens makes her look giant against the trees in the background. Good use of the reflective wet pavement too. Colors are a bit too yellow in the skin tones and trees, even for a the warm tones of a sunset (assumed).

Legit question: 

How does lightning strike from a volcano cloud? I've only ever seen lightning in the clouds from the sky, before, so this is a new concept to me. How am I supposed to get all the way up there with just this stupid ring and my stupid midget buddies?

""Who disturbs my slumber?""Shit like this is why ancient civilizations believed in cool gods.OMG I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

Okay, fun fact about Venus, the atmosphere is to thick and hot for rain, so when it rains sulfuric acid on venus it evaporates a few km above the surface.

But there is lightning? Lightning on earth comes with rainstorms, but the lack of rainstorms on venus means that the lightning  comes from the volcanic ash buildup in the atmosphere.This is WILD.

Do you any original characters you have come up with? 



is there a rule against impromptu ama-ing someone? This is beyond awesome. Having an original drawing like that would surely embiggen the smallest man.
It's nice to see event he professionals starts off with the rudimentary circles break down before drawing in the details.

He also does little things like this. Most of his life he worked on Hey Arnold and Spongebob, so it's more often that he will be asked to draw one of those than a Simpson's character. He's from a small town in Virginia, so whenever we visit, everyone crowds him in public hoping for a personalized drawing. He's like a local celebrity! He also does little doodles for my roommates and friends for their birthdays. It's such a fun skill to have!I wish I knew how to go be an animator,  it's my dream career.

http://cdn5.movieclips.com/paramount/t/top-secret-1984/0549550_15137_MC_Tx360.jpgMy prediction is someone will photoshop an angel standing in front with it's arms out pushing each semi to save him. It will be reposted to facebook next week and my mom will show it to me next month. Can anyone figure out how he got in that position? Perpendicular to two parallel semis? As a former firefighter I have seen people live through much worse. I don't have pictures to prove it but it is weird how some people can survive crazy shit. The majority of them where not in great shape but they did live.

The one that I remember most though is a drunk that hit a mini-van head on. This was back in 1989 and the guys head punched through the windshield. The Sgt. went to support his neck and his fingers slid inside his throat. Took us all back for a few seconds and then we went back to the rescue.

Once we removed the dash both of his legs where facing towards his torso and through all this, he was breathing. Not with it, but alive.

He survived though.Like a good neighbor, state farm is therrreee..... with a hacksawhttp://i.imgur.com/ds7nimr.gifvDoes anyone else find it unsettling that there is a skull like face embedded into the crumpled frame just to the right of his face?!So this is actually my cousin, just got off the phone with him. He was coming back from a business trip in Oregon (he's a farmer in Washington) when this happened. According to him there semis in front of him hit black ice, and he then slid into them, crushing him like this. His airbag didn't go off (luckily) and he said he had about 1 ft. of room to move around in. He was able to get out of the car after about 30 minutes. Although he says he only has a couple cuts and a bruise near his eye, he did go to the hospital where he was checked out and everything was fine. He's now happy to be home with his son and pregnant wife.

I was like, ""damn! That's a good name for a cat. I want a cat named Scribbles, but OP already has a cat named Scribbles."" But then I saw it was scribbles and not Scribbles the cat.
