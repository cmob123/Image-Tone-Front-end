I have similar windows right next to my desk, every day a female cardinal lands on the window sill and looks at herself for several minutes, sometimes pecking at her image.  Usually the male eventually sees her and starts singing at her until she turns and they fly off.   I always imagine him yelling ""C'mon, you look fine!, We have to go, we're going to be late!""
We never got deer, but we definitely got a lot of people stopping to fix their hair, a few fixing makeup and one muscly asian guy who danced while staring at himself for about five minutes.

Probably the best and cruelest use of it was gluing a coin to the pavement.They suck when geese or swans nest by them, the dumb things see their reflections and think that it's a rival, and peck at the windows.

He would peck his reflection for hours and hours every day for weeks.My grandparents used to have a house in Tucson with one-way windows. Every morning we would wake up to a family of quails banging their heads against the window, I assume to beat up the other, identical family of quails who were invading their turf.

Quails are not so smart.[deleted]I worked in my university's print shop full-time, sweet deal, free tuition and they let me leave for three hours each day, with pay, to attend one class plus I was on campus for the evening class as well.  Anyway, our print shop was mostly underground but had these windows where you could look up to the sidewalk.  There was a railing just above and a lot of students would lean on the railing.  I had six student aides working for me and Jesus Christ did they ever stare up the skirts through that window all damn day.  I never did because I'm just not that type of guy.  I ended up taping cardboard over the windows between semesters so the next batch of aides didn't know any better, but sure enough those guys had already heard about the perk and tore down my cardboard.Expected two hobos fucking.  Was pleasantly surprised.Its great until someone stores their dildo against the window.That ain't no deer I ever seen. Where is this?

EDIT: First video taken down, [here is the video i was talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbvZNy7Bmw)I worry more about airborne debris than I do about a pressure wave.    My dad was a maintenance foreman at a refinery for many years.  They had just got on site when a grain elevator about 3/4 mile away exploded.  Not your normal little sheet metal silo, but a huge concrete structure on the ship channel.  They saw it go and could feel the heat on their skin.  One of dad's crew yelled ""Take cover!"" and they scuttled behind the cracking tower they were going to work on that day.  Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet.How deep does it go?So does anyone know why caused that massive explosion? Knowing my luck, i bet those tar filters i ordered from China last week were in one of those shipping containers.Only 50 people died? How many were vaporized?is there a before picture?That was the largest explosion I've seen that isn't a nuke.  I don't even think a MOAB is that big.To give you another unbelievable indication of the explosions scale, here is a ""before"" picture of the exact area affected from Google Earth.  The red circle is the now water-filled crater, the yellow is the area substantially destroyed by the blast.

http://i.imgur.com/JvmXti5.jpg

It kind of looks like the crater is filled with water --does anyone know? It's difficult to see the depth of the crater.Thank God the explosion happened in that giant craterIs that how it's going to be remembered from now on?  The Tianjin Crater.  Just level the ground around it and abandon the land or turn it into a park of something.  

I lived close by to a massive explosion that happened in Quebec.  [The McMasterville Explosion 1975](http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/faits_divers/clips/12049/).  That too made a huge crater in the ground and levelled an entire factory complex that belonged to CIL.  The remaining factory was demolished and scrapped.  [You can see for yourself the land has been abandoned to this very day.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/McMasterville,+QC/@45.5403273,-73.2314636,720m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cc9aa8c356f3055:0xadd1c7a969a383e4!6m1!1e1)  It's not a farm, the land is too saturated with chemical toxins.  It's not a dump because the toxins make it too dangerous to work in.  It's just fenced off abandoned land.

(NukeMap uses google API, so you can switch to satellelite view and drag the point of impact around to compare.)It really does look like the aftermath of some type of nuclear fallout. Scary stuff.from Wikipedia:

>Chinese state media reported that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics,[5] a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.[3]

 

>The first to respond to the fire were unable to keep it from spreading. The Global Times reported that firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water, as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in chain more violent chemical reactions.

We got on the train, and all fell asleep pretty quickly. I was first to wake up and I was quick to notice that although we were still moving, it was very slow and dark. I looked out the window and down the train, and to my amazement the fucking train was being put into a big cruise ship. I quickly nudged my buddies awake, and as any engineering major would do, they all instantly sprung an infrastructure boner. We were flabbergasted. Our train is going into a boat this is insane. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any cooler, they let everyone out of the train to walk around the ship, grab a bite to eat, have a cigarette and stretch your legs. The best part though, was hitting the duty free shop and getting a bunch of booze for the rest of the trip. I don't know if that's a normal mode of transportation in Europe or even in the U.S. but it was the first time I had seen it and I was blown away.In addition to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel already described, the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel also has the same configuration.  Here's a picture of it [EDIT: actually, with thanks to /u/chasetwisters for the clarification, a picture of its next-door neighbor bridge-tunnel the MMBT, see below for the real image].

""Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge.

Completed in 2007, the arch spans 420 metres (1,380 ft) ranking among the longest arch bridges in the world. The bridges carries 6 lanes of traffic and two track of Chongqing Rail Transit Line 3 between the Nan'an District south of the Yangtze River and the Yuzhong District to the north.

Was it posted?  We occasionally get deaths from people entering the glacial ice caves here in Washington.[deleted]Kinda depressing story ...

When I was 16 I went on an Alaskan cruise.  I got food poisoning and was in bed or throwing up through most of the trip, but I was well enough to watch the cruise through and past a whole bunch of glaciers next to each other.  One after the other.  It was amazing.  It felt like they were SO close to me and the ship.  Totally amazing seeing them all dead end into a big body of water.

So this year I went on the same kind of cruise again.  I'm 31 now and decided it was time to go and not get deathly ill.  It was a great cruise this time, but when it came to cruise past those VERY SAME glaciers ... they were almost gone.  They had receded SO FAR back up the mountains that we were hardly able to get close to them at all.  I had to use my binoculars just to see the detail I was able to see just looking out a window last cruise.  

The amount of melting, just in the short 15 years I had been there last, was SO fucking depressing to me.

tl;dr:  Went to Alaska 15 years apart.  Glaciers are disappearing.  We're fucked as a species.In the years to come when this is reposted kids will ask ""what's a glacier?""This image reminds me of a documentary of Inuit mussel-gatherers waiting for the sea ice to drop so they can break through the ice and harvest mussels before the sea rises again. Here's the documentary by BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMZYDQ6v24How thick is the ice above you? Seems like sunlight can get throughI now realize if Superman had his ice fortress it would have melted by now.

This is /r/whoahdude  worthy.I wonder how the water tastes.Light blue helmet looks very happy :)Is that Mendenhall Glacier?That is so fucking cool and so fucking scary at the same time.That's a bit clumsy of you. They're huge!How dangerous is that? I went camping at some ice caves a few years back (not inside, just near them) and there were signs everywhere saying to not go in them and if you do to not make any noise in them. In fact, a few months back a person was killed and some injured due to back to back collapses in a matter of days.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlDxgo-L7DMLook out for Falmer.I remember a geology professor explicitly telling us how incredibly dangerous hiking ""into"" a glacier isHow dangerous is that?

Here's an excellent explanation from NASA:

http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/30may_solareclipse2/

> ""Solar images formed by pinholes, crossed fingers, patches between leaves, all occur because of diffraction--a wave property of light. In the case of a pinhole, the light rays do not shoot straight by the rim of the hole, but bend around the edge. This wave effect creates a diffraction pattern of rings on the screen which resembles a bull's eye. That's for a flat wave single light source. If the aperture is illuminated by a scene, it acts as a lens to image the scene on a screen. With the right size hole relative to the right distance to a screen, a clear image is formed. That's the general principle of a pinhole camera.""
> 
> ""Applying this to an eclipse observation, the sun becomes the object to view. Point the pinhole camera at the sun and you see a solar image (projected on a screen) dim enough your eyes can enjoy.""
> 
> ""But the pinhole effect doesn't need a designed aperture. The solar image can be formed by any aperture if the shadow is the right distance away. The sunrays though tree leaves work to make a solar image on the ground below. Blinds on the window will covert a square opening into a round sun on the wall.""
> 
> ""The marvel is that diffraction doesn't need a round hole to form an image. A square pinhole will also work if its area is the same. Even for a random edged shape, the wave bending will average out to form an image of the scene contained in the incident light. That's why the spots of light through the trees are round; the gaps in the foliage are imaging the sun. ""I... Don't understand how the sun being partially blocked would change the shadows that a tree casts.Who's the dipshit building attack-speed Soraka?That's an amazing shot! The tree leaves act similar to how pinhole cameras work, [leaving these little eclipse casts](http://i.imgur.com/Y20dSSJ.png)Go see for yourself during the [next eclipse](http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html) near you.For those doubting, it [works like this.](http://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x400/pinholeprojectionpaper.jpg)This guy. Think about all of the cameras pointed up at the moon when this was taken, and this smart guy is facing the opposite way.The last time a total eclipse happened in my area, I was 7 or 8. We were in school and we all went out with our two pieces of paper to see the pinhole effect. I was a hyper kid and my teacher hated me so as soon I started to get the least bit out of hand she sent me to sit on the curb in the shade and miss the eclipse. I was super bummed seeing as how I really liked science stuff. As I sat there I started to notice all the shadows changing around me. It was like millions of little pinhole eclipses all around me. All of the rest of the class was out in the parking lot with their shitty paper pinholes but I had my own personal light show. It was cool as shit. Thanks for bringing back that memory OP. It happensh here in Shcotland, too. My ash looksh like a shilver-birch! 
http://imgur.com/ZSbxkuLI know what's happening here! My physics teacher showed us an extremely similar photo. It's called a pinhole camera. The leaves in the tree have tiny little holes in them that the sunshine is passing through. This causes the image to be projected upside down on to the house like that. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera

Fun fact! If you wear glasses get a piece of paper and poke a tiny hole in it. Look through it without your glasses with one eye and you should be able to see clearly through the hole.Pretty sure if you had a staff with a gem on it you could stick it in the ground and use mirrors to uncover ancient secretsi saw this once in...1993 I think?  I was walking to class and saw half moons all over the sidewalk.  I knew right away what it was.

Luckily I was going to the engineering building and they has all kinds of stuff to look at it.  the best was looking through a compact disc.toenail clippings...everywhere.Looks like Porom and Palom just cast FlareAlso, during near-totality, overhead power and communication lines will throw sharp shadows. Normally they don't throw a shadow at all because they are much thinner than the sun's disk.Photographer and light enthusiast here. What you're looking at here is the camera obscura effect. One of the most underrated and unheard of properties of light.Huh, Oberon is real. Tenno unite!I surely bet /r/mildlyinteresting will love this.Trippy.This looks like it was taken during the last big annular eclipse we got a few years ago.  

I am really excited that the US is actually going to be in the path of a total solar eclipse in August of 2017.  I will be making the trip to southern Illinois for that one, because it's probably the only total Eclipse that will ever cross this part of the earth in my lifetime.That's fucking wild.There is a Japanese word that describes this (minus the eclipse/banana part)- has not Direct English translated word.

edit: Ok I got it. Look at the orange thing in the center of the white ""loop"", thats the Mallards mouth + nostrils facing TOWARDS you. then the little spaces in the bottom are its feet

The swan is facing left, the mallard is facing towards the camera basically.I'm going to disagree with the majority here. It's a wonderful concept but the execution is a little unrefined. The type face of the logo and the restaurant are not the same so it feels disconnected. I think if the designer had instead focused on drawing the animals to create the ampersand, rather than squeezing them in to the sans serif ampersand, it would have better reflected the elegance of the type face in *The Swan & Mallard*.  There's greater potential here.

Is it going to be left there as a historical site? Or would it be moved somewhere like a museum? Just think of everything that has happened in human history in the past 1,700 years. The Crusades.

Great fun and a crazy trip....never actually thought we would find what we were after Can you imagine spending so much time and energy on this, and then seeing it on the ground and picking it up. Probably a very surreal moment I've been following their [blogging](https://operationthonapa.com/) as they have found different items from the plane, human remains, etc. This is an amazing story to watch unfold and my hat's off to these awesome two dudes. Talk about having a goal and getting it done.

More info on the crash: 
[Eastern Airlines Flight 980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980)Dan Futrell and I (Isaac Stoner) got lost down a rabbit hole on on Wikipedia looking up unrecovered black boxes. Took some serious effort but now there's a smashed up flight recorder on my kitchen counter!  That's the orange box. They need to keep looking.Actually, they found pieces of the casing of the flight recorders, and some loose magnetic tape which, [as they themselves say on their blog](https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61), may be nothing more than tape from a passenger's home video.

It's far too early to say they've found anything substantive, regardless of how amazing it is that they've managed to find anything at all.I just got to the part of the blog where they talk about finding crocodile skins all over the debris field, and basically accusing Eastern Airlines of taking part in a crocodile skin smuggling ring. Interesting...maybe they'll end up uncovering more than they bargained for, which is like the beginning of every horror/thriller movie.Why didn't any of the various airplane crash investigative agencies do this?

edit: answered my own question, sort of:  The NTSB did send people but ""because the wreckage was spread over a vast area and covered by 6 to 9 meters of snow, it was not possible for him and his fellow team members to locate either of the ""black boxes.""""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980#On-site_investigationI set small goals like not losing a sock in the laundry and I can't even accomplish that.I had read their blog as they were doing this. The part where they were finding the human remains and burying them... super powerful stuff man. I teared up a little reading that. Congrats on finding the recorder!That's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Or a small box in the Andes...Holy shit this is awesome. It makes me want to find another plane crash that has missing black boxes and go find one myself... Talk about bucket list shit.I bet it was the last place they looked.This will be an over dramatized movie, I guarantee it. ""dood we fahkin found the blahk bawx bro""Notice the subtle middle finger in the picture.I feel like they could have found this faster by crashing another plane into the mountain and watching where everything fell.Send these dudes after 370.

>From Wednesday, August 19, through to Sunday, August 23, the ninth Sail Amsterdam event will be held in Amsterdam. The popular opening parade runs for 12 kilometers and will consist of 50 tall sailing ships. Many of the vessels will have sailed there directly from Bremerhaven in Germany where another tall ships event ended last Sunday.

>In total, more than 1,000 vessels are expected to participate in the sailing extravaganza in IJ bay. Organizers expect up to two million visitors to attend the free event. According to them, Sail Amsterdam is the largest public event in the Netherlands - and the largest event of its kind in the world.

**Photo Details:**

This photo is a 26.6 MP photo  merged from two 24 MP shots from a Sony a7 camera. I had a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.4 manual focus lens (with a B+W filter for protection) attached. The two shots were merged using Lightroom's built in photomerge (which results in a single raw pano). Not much was done in Lightroom other than exposure changes, color changes and some healing brush to remove lens flare.

This photo was taken after I shot a 3 hour timelapse of the sunrise. I was just about leave, when I decided to actually take a few photos.

I've only built one brick/stone wall, but when we did it we started at the bottom.> Just as individual blocks were prepared, so too were the adjoining stones already set in the wall.  In order to receive a new block, bedding planes were carved into those stones below or to the side of the block to be added. This is how the Twelve-Angled Stone took on its busy upper outline; the upper portions of the block were recarved several times over as five blocks  set in a left to right sequence  were fitted along the course above.

> Other blocks in the wall were similarly shaped, then reshaped as new blocks were added to the masonry mass. As stones of irregular size and degree of finish were inserted into the mural fabric with fastidious technical consistency, the wall went up as tectonic sculpture.

- Adam Herring, Shimmering Foundation: The Twelve-Angled Stone of Inca Cusco, Critical Inquiry, Autumn 2010.

**Edit:**  Several comments questioned my use of ""nearly a thousand years."" Here's where I got that figure: according to wikipedia, Cusco was founded in 1100, and then occupied by the Inca ""from the 13th Century to the 16th Century."" I have no idea when that particular stone was laid, but it seems to have been somewhere between 500 and 900 years ago.  I was intentionally vague with the date, since I don't know the exact century. I've also seen suggestions that it predates the Inca. If someone has that info, I'd appreciate you commenting with it!

**Edit 2:**  Just out of curiosity, I went through and counted: as of right now, there are 54 top-level comments jokingly asserting that this was aliens.  There are 17 top-level comments that are literally just the word ""aliens.""  In the time it took me to count, 4 more were added.

[deleted]not gonna lie, but i'm kinda turned on by this...you should have seen their score at tetris....Why couldn't they have just made them all brick shaped and saved time and whatever they used for money back then. These guys were obviously getting paid by the hour.Ancient Aztec masons were agents of the Mexican Nuevo World Order as directed by the Illuminachos. I'm not saying it's aliens...But totally aliens.If there's one thing I've realised, it's that humans a thousand (or more) years ago were just as intelligent as we are today. Sure they didn't have anything like the technology we have, but they were just as skilled and had equally rich and complex lives as those we have today.Meanwhile, [last week...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O38QHzM0tzw/S-YAkoeP58I/AAAAAAAAB20/7FQ5sd8tv7k/s1600/IMG_1133.JPG)[there's no end to what you can do when you don't give a fuck about particular people](http://i.imgur.com/7R6PWWN.jpg)Quick Background before comment:  I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Architecture.  My thesis specifically focused on the integration of 3D printing technologies into masonry construction, using ancient approaches as a basis for design.

Now.  Something to know about these masonry walls is that they are not nearly as intricate and ""perfect"" as they appear to be.  From the outside (the face), the stones are chiseled using the surrounding stone as a basis.  On the interior of the wall, however, you will find that each of these stones is more ""wedge"" shaped, and is held in place with a plethora of smaller ""filler rocks.""  

From the outside, it looks impossible.  Once you look inside, you'll find that it's really just as simple as shaping one side of the rock, just along the edges.Peru was an amazing country to visit, I thoroughly enjoyed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. Some of the most amazing scenery. Anyone who has thought about going to Peru, fucking do it, spend at least a month there there's so much to see!

On a side note, I can't stand the ancient aliens bull shit. I don't think we give nearly enough credit to ancient peoples and their intelligence and ingenuity.

It's becoming ever more likely that Iceland will elect the first pirate prime minister (after this the pirate party may even get close to 50%). European politics gets more fascinating by the day.PM's response tomorrow: ""I have ordered an internal investigation of my self, and we have found that I did nothing wrong.""

Edit: well whaddya knowIs this real? Good on those people for going out and demanding action.[deleted]What did the prime minister do?The people of iceland have their shit together. They don't get pushed around by politicians and bankers. 

This should happen everywhere. 

Edit: Yes I know iceland isn't a very highly populated country. Which makes it's an easier thing to do.

Edit 2: Not saying that no other country has their stuff together and so on. Just praising iceland.For historical context, I recommend the Icelandic novel The Atom Station. It gives some background to the cultural attitudes of the polity of Iceland. I don't know about Iceland but we don't read it in schools in the US generally. It's a great read.I'm jealous that they live in a such a politically-active society. Which is the opposite of what I thought, you'd think the cold would make people sluggish and wanting to spend more time under the covers.That's not all of Iceland. I mean, Michael isn't there.I really hope people around the world yell and holler at this secretive hoarding of wealth by the rich. Only the illegal stuff of course.

A regular guy who selflessly brought joy to sick children.

RIP man.  I'm really sorry to hear of his passing.

I think it would be nice if the makers of the Batman games and movies gave him a nod.

He was a real hero.Waking up to learn there's one less hero in the world made me suddenly feel very tired again. Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.So he pulled onto the left shoulder, but his car was still partially in the lane and somebody hit him. I wonder if his hazards were on, because that car is jet black and would be really hard to spot at night.I met this guy last year almost to the day. My daughter has a leg length discrepancy and we were at a specialist hospital in Baltimore and he was there giving all the kids lanyards and huge coloring books. We were really looking forward to seeing him again next month when we went back. R.I.P.According to the stories I've read, Mr. Robinson would stop by the nurse's station before he left to find out if there were any children too sick to come out to see him, so that he could make sure to go in to see them specifically.

That's the key to his character.  This wasn't about attention or fame or publicity or promoting some cause of business.  We wouldn't know who this guy was if he hadn't gotten a speeding ticket and accidentally gone viral.  He kept right on doing the same thing after he got famous as he did before he got famous.  And the most important thing to him was that sick kid who wasn't able to come out to see him.

Bruce Wayne is a fiction; an entertaining fiction, but a fiction.  Lenny Robinson was a real man who is a role model for thoughtfulness, selflessness, and making a difference in a small way.

Batman was real, and his name was Lenny Robinson.Here is a video of Lenny visiting sick kids in the hospital.  He truly was a hero deserving of the name, Batman.  The world is a darker place without him.   RIP Batman.

https://youtu.be/fDDBJajLZwwLenny was in a documentary called Legends of the Knight that is on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/80014903) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/795787), if anyone wants to check out his story and see him in action. It's about people who use Batman as an inspiration for themselves or others.

Seeing the kids respond to him is incredible. The world lost a great man.Batman taken out by a Toyota Camry.  This world is fucked up.Too bad it wasn't [this guy instead](http://i.imgur.com/IMc8Kiv.jpg)A tad late to things, but Lenny was actually very close to one of my best friends and his family. A group of my friends (whom all play SSBM together, shouts out to /r/smashbros and the Melee Community) all learned of Lenny's passing this morning straight from our buddy. Although the loss was hard for him and his family, I feel its important to highlight the good that Lenny put into this world. Admittedly, I did not know Lenny nearly as closely as my friend or his family, but I do recall a very specific memory I had with Lenny a couple years ago. At my friend's Bar Mitzvah Lenny was there decked out in full batman attire. He was a class act by all definitions, and went out of his way to make sure every kid, myself included had a memorable experience. An entertaining, genuine, loving individual, Lenny aka Uncle Batman will be missed. RIP Uncle Batman. He was a hero this world needed.

Proof: My friend, the dopest Marth/Fox main in the world with his partner in justice Uncle Batman. Although they weren't technically related, Lenny was considered part of his family.

by a Toyota Camry,

...so help me jesusIf there is an afterlife, he's going to the good side of town. He clearly lived a cool life if he had the money to buy a lambo and a batsuit. He then had the heart to use that for a greater good and in the process gave us all some laughs. RIP Lenny.Such a shame, my son was in a children's hospital and this gentleman was there with his 60's Batmobile that he had recently purchased and was driving back east with.  Got some pics of the [Batmobile](http://i.imgur.com/nKnRe63.jpg?1) and my son still has his [autograph](http://i.imgur.com/XlrPgMI.jpg) hanging up in his room.  
He not only put some smiles on the kids faces but also everyone at the hospital that went out to check out the car.  He was the Hero we needed that day.*batman voice* just here in my garage, with my new Lamborghini that I bought. Fun to drive around Gotham. You know what I like better than Lamborghini's...JUSTICEThats terrible. He's more of a hero than the guy he was dressed as and probably never realized it. RIP Lenny. You were a Batman among men.i live in maryland. i can not tell you how many times since i got my license over 20 years ago now,  the countless people that have been killed by their cars breaking down and them getting out and standing near their car on the side of the road, attempting to change a flat tire, or are under the hood checking the engine. 95 percent of the time these people are safely out of the driving lanes and yet people still manage to hit them. im telling you now for anyone who doesnt know about maryland: 

MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.

ive never seen worse drivers. and ive lived in huge cities. it is the worst here for accidents like this one. it is the reason why we have the highest insurance rates in the united states. if you have the unfortunate problem of living here or for some ungodly reason decide to visit here as a tourist im going to give you a little advice: 

- IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDIAN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE WALL, AND IF THERE IS GRASS BY THE MEDIAN PULL ALL THE WAY OVER INTO THE GRASS!

- NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR CAR ON A MARYLAND HIGHWAY TO CHANGE A TIRE OR LOOK AT YOUR ENGINE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  IF YOU HAVE A FLAT DRIVE IT ON THE SIDE MEDIAN UNTIL YOU CAN FIND AN EXIT. EVEN IF IT MEANS DAMAGING YOUR RIM. YOUR RIM IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE. 

- IF IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR CANNOT BE FIXED DO NOT SIT IN YOUR CAR WAITING UNTIL HELPS ARRIVES!! EVEN IF YOU ARE SAFELY OFF TO THE SIDE. PEOPLE HERE WILL STILL HIT YOU!

So, Robinson went to school with her, appearing in full costume before the student body. He told them bullying was wrong and called her onstage to give her a Batman necklace.

> The Ankh is a river serpenting through the Sto Plains, reaching the Circle Sea by the town of Ankh-Morpork. By then, it can only be called a river because it moves faster than the banks. You can't drown in the Ankh, but it is really easy to suffocate.

> It has been said that the Ankh is the only river in the multiverse where cops can draw a chalk outline when a corpse is found. 

>There is a legend in Ankh-Morpork of an ancient drum in the palace that will bang itself if ever an enemy fleet is seen sailing up the Ankh, although the legend has died out in recent centuries, partly because it's the Age of Reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the Ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front.There's something alive in there!

Edit: I don't know if this has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but that flashy building behind is one of the many overpriced white elephants our corrupt government has built with money that should be put to better use, built especially for the Olympics. It's called the Museum of Tomorrow, and it supposedly has something to do with sustainable devopment.

I toyed with the idea of making a long, well researched post detailing why people shouldn't come here, or shouldn't support our corrupt government with your travel money, but the research made me too depressed. Just Google shit. Zika virus, Dengue and Chikungunya are as endemic as corruption in all levels of government, the violence in Rio makes Detroit look like EuroDisney, I could go on and on and on...

Not sure what it's like now, but back then (20+ years ago... jeez I'm old) 90% of the time it was the book Oprah had talked about that day/week/month (I don't recall if she had her ""book club"" at the time or not, because I was a teenage male who did not own a television so 3 strikes against giving a shit about her show). 

If I recall correctly the ""green cover book"" was the Celestine Prophecy, the ""outside party after dark"" book was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Why do I recall these things... because I was asked the same question (more or less) a hundred times. 

This was before everyone had a cell phone, much less a smartphone, so there wasn't an easy way to ""look it up"" (this was when you still had to buy Netscape).

We would be ecstatic if you could add a caption or comment to this post mentioning our name and our website bluewillowbookshop.com!!The Fault in Our Stars isn't  in there.One time I was at a fairly large Indigo book store looking for a book I'd seen before online.  Of course I couldn't remember the name of it or the author, so I was just skimming through the section I thought it would be in.  A lady that worked there asked me if I needed help, and I was almost going to just tell her I was fine because I thought there's no way she can help me find this book.  But, i thought what the hell, let's give it a shot.  So i told what I remembered about the book, which was basically that it was 'kinda sciency' and 'had a red triangle on the front'.  She took a second to think about it, then ""Oh yeah, it's over here""  and then she took me a couple rows over, reaches down to the bottom shelf and pulls out the book I was looking for.

Did she just know where every book was?

Was she magic?Twist, all those covers are just dust jackets for other booksOh hell no. This actually happened. Couldn't tell me the name, what it was about our who wrote it but they had seen their friend's copy and it was (kid you not) blue. 

45 minutes of talking about the types of books the friend liked and narrowing it down slowly I found the fucking book. 

They looked at it, said ""oh, yeah. That's what it was called. Thanks"" and walked out of the store without buying a damn thing. 

Fuck that person. If it's have had a weapon, I'd have gone to jail. As a former B&N employee I can concur. This happened way too often, or they would have oddly specific irrelevant information. ""I'm looking for a book. It's got a tree on the cover and is 357 pages long."" 

My other favorite thing was when they would just say ""I'm looking for a book."" I would then grab the nearest book to me, hand it to them, and walk off.

This makes me so ridiculously happy!! My parents had this exact album when I was growing up and played it ALL the time. In fact, it was even the background soundtrack at my Dad's memorial service. I spoke of his die-hard hippie spirit and all he'd imbued upon us. God damn hippies ruining the nuclear family of America! Man they've probably been through some shit together, and by shit I mean wild hippy orgys and swinger romps.This is really nice. My parents and the 2 other couples that they went to Woodstock with are all still together. They are all still best friends as well. They have known each other since high school and still get together almost every other week. My mom speaks to the 2 other women on the phone probably every day. I have been on multiple family vacations with all of them from when I was very young through my late teens. I have been to all of their kids weddings and they were at mine. It's a nice story about a Bunch of kids from the Bronx that life turned out pretty nice for. The most beautiful thing is not only are they still together, they're still smiling.
Staying married to the same person for decades is harder than it looks.I didn't even know the Woz was married LSD in the 60s and a lifetime of proper fucking will plant a permanent grin on your face.

EDIT: To make this less of an awful comment, [here's a photo I took when I covered Eaux Claires last year](http://i.imgur.com/YDfpYAw.jpg). I love seeing moments like these...when two people are so intimate and comfortable with each other. I live vicariously through those glimpses of happiness.

EDIT EDIT: Here's [another one from the same festival](http://i.imgur.com/QeFQ612.jpg). I was shooting The National, and during their song 'I Need My Girl' this guy next to me turned around, got down on one knee, and proposed to his girlfriend. This is almost directly after (I let them have their moment obviously, she was sobbing!) and then I asked their permission to take it. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to ask their names, so I'm hoping someday someone recognizes them. I mean look at his face. That is happiness.She was my elementary school nurse and I went to school with both their sons. They are really great people.  They had a cockatoo that was a fucking dick that would attack people though.

Growing up near these birds I never thought twice about it.

However, I was surprised to find how many people didn't realize that these birds can fly.

[Here is a video of a peacock in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Gr_0cHlpM)

I've never seen them fly long distances however I have seen them fly to high trees (30+ feet tall).

I've never seen them directly fly to the top of a 30ft tree, usually they fly to the lower branches and I think they just work their way to the top.  

When I visited the Arcadia, CA arboretum, a worker said there is a peacock that can fly and perch itself up on one of its 60+ foot tall trees.

[Here's a very out of focus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaO1vhDyrk) but it does show some context of these birds flying out of pretty tall trees.Peacocks are not graceful, my school had them all over the place and it would really be stretching it to call what they do flying.

They flap their wings like a motherfucker, making all kinds of racket, just to get up onto the roof and then when they decide to come down it's like the god damned Hindenburg.  You hear this loud flapping followed by them crashing down and it's all Oh, the humanity.....""

Then it slowly pulled me towards the door, and I kinda said ""Okay"" and started walking to the door, dog leading me by the pant leg, when I got to the door, it started pushing me.

Our neighborhood hardware store has a shop cat. All that lazy bastard does is lie on the counter in the sun. And occasionally try to trip customers while escaping out the door.

Still - the neighborhood hardware store is a wonderful place. Little old man or lady who knows where every thing is, even the gizmo they bought in 1947 and never sold. If you have one , cherish it, shop there. Because big box home stores have no souls and often no clue !I hope OP wanted a sprinkler hose, cuz they got one now.Good job pupper. 

Whoops, wrong sub. http://i.imgur.com/xxR7c6P.jpgThere's a gas station in a town I used to live in ran by some hilarious incredibly nice middle eastern dude. He trained his cat to reach out its paw and lower its head to show you respect for a tip, then when you give it a tip it puts it in its mouth (if it's cash) and brings it to him. Or pushes it off the counter into a little red cup if you use change. After that he gives it a treat. 

In Belgium, Wisconsin, the only hardware store in town is also the only liquor store in town.He looks like such a good boy :) I want to give him a treat.Now you can't shop anywhere else ever again. 
*Edit: Can I be someone other than GallowBoob?Do they sell anvils?I grew up in a small town. As a kid I needed a last minute physical so I could play sports in school. Our local doctor wasn't available so we went to an even smaller town nearby where I could see a doctor. The doctor's office had a giant lazy dog lying on the floor of the waiting room. He was breathing so you could tell he was alive but otherwise he gave no indication of life. The doctor was smoking a cigarette with the longest ash imaginable. He asked me, ""Are you healthy?"" I nodded. He said,""ok"" filled out the form and I left. That was the physical.I hope this is true, because that's fuckin' adorable.They used to have seven dogs and a wonderful selection of dark chocolate.Ask him a question please...

He said that they were amazed by the plethora of stuff you could buy in a grocery store. If you had been caught taking photos illegally, what kind of punishment would be typical?

I'd expect your camera would be confiscated or you'd be forced to delete the photos, but was there any threat of being detained or anything?Looking at your full photo series, these are some amazing candid photos of life in North Korea that I have never seen anywhere else.  The one thing that struck me was that any picture that wasn't in a city had food growing in it, and the hills were almost denuded of trees.In North Korea, there are places you can visit and places you cannot visit, and the latter are far more numerous. Well, this is one of them. Usually, we were accompanied by our guides, one in the front, one in the back. But at one point they were both in the front, which allowed for a literally 15-second long detour into this ordinary shop for North Koreans. That gave me maybe 10 seconds to take this picture, before being kicked out by the ""bad cop"" guide, and the atmosphere became rather unpleasant. I'm not sure if he saw me taking these pictures.

Also, I've got a photo album with the photos of my journey into North Korea, if anyone is interested.Nicely done!  Would love to see more of those ""staged"" North Korean areas to see the parity.My Chinese girlfriend has been to North Korea and had these pics to share. 

http://imgur.com/a/m7CKwWhat was your favorite and least favorite thing about visiting North Korea? Thanks for sharing your pics! :)These pictures are fascinating. Just case you haven't seen before here's the Korean peninsula at night from space. Seoul the big lit-up city in the middle and north Korea almost entirely without electric lights http://i.imgur.com/nAryc46.jpg RIP Guide.No lights OP?

Something always bothered me in all the pics of the last two Kims surrounded by their generals looking and pointing at things that I couldn't put my finger on...then one day I realized the flash of the camera was the light. Otherwise they were in very dim lit rooms. I want to say first that this kind of quality contribution to Reddit is why I love being on this website.  This is an example of a stellar piece of original content that is both interesting and informative.  I also appreciate the fact that /u/M1ckey took time out to answer other people's questions about his trip.

Thanks for taking the time out to post this to Reddit.  With all that said, I have a couple questions for you.  :)

First, did you ever have any experiences where you felt somewhat anxious or unnerved (guards acting threatening, eyeing you up, etc.)

Second, were there any Americans with your group?  I'm curious if they would allow Americans at all (I know they did in the past, but obviously they can change that at any time).  

Thanks again.  Love your pictures.  This is actually worthy of a publication like National Geographic picking up on this or maybe a story in the NYT.  Very cool.Staggering, beautiful, eerie and quite sad. Do you want to be thrown in a gulag? Because this is how you get thrown in a gulag. Why does North Korea allow people in to visit?Kimmy is not happy you took this, op. You have officially lost your ticket to North Korean Valhalla. >They also searched the laptops for any Korean films, for the Interview comedy

This really cracked me up!  *It was, like, 2 years ago Un!  Let it go!*

Also, thanks very much for posting these.  Keep 'em coming.Can I get a price check on the veggies there on the counter?The guides were probably killed after this and you just started the new Korean war all because of a photo jkThank you for posting these! Great pictures and commentary to go with them. It is amazing to see inside the country, even though most of what you see is depressing. I thought all the produce in North Korea was fake..> Pro tip: You can override the firmware on your camera, so that the Delete button doesn't really delete the photos

Clever. Don't push your luck too much though, these guys are ruthless (unless you're willing to face the consequences). It's really sad that people have to suffer because one idiot was born with such powers to control the country and no one can change it.. At least for now..

About the pretty girls, anyway, I didn't know if they did shady stuff. But the owner does get food from us often, so we have an okay relationship with her.

My mom and the Massage parlor owner were talking about their lease terms a few weeks ago and they were both complaining that business was bad and that we're all looking to sell our businesses and move elsewhere. My mom said bad business was partly due to being close to the college. The lady rants up with ""I know! And college kids they're the worst! They never tip!

*This* is why you need to be careful when buying a car not to buy a ""salvage"" title. Cars like this are bought from the owners by the insurance companies, and then some are resold at auction by increasingly unscrupulous people as the car goes down the chain. Soon it appears at a fly-by-night car lot, looking all spiffy... but if you check the title history (via carfax or similar) you'll find the ""flood salvage"" on there.

And this sheep escaped from the ranch. And you know they shear sheep for their wool. Well, this thing stayed gone for seven years. Finally they found it, in a cave. And there was nobody to shear the sheep, so when they found it, its wool was gigantic. It was, like, a walking afro. And it wound up back on the ranch, just another sheep, but for the rest of its life it knew that for a while, it was free. It had that and nobody could take it away. Do you understand? Im like you; I want to face this thing. Whatever it is. Were like that sheep, taking our shot. If for no other reason than just to say we did.

He continued running across campus and everyone who had been staking me out ran after him.  
&nbsp;  
I waited two minutes and then walked quietly back to my dorm.I was in a dorm where there was a girl who looked just like me, dressed like me, and even had the same major. 

She even walked and talked like me. It was rather unreal. Our names sounded similar, just one letter off, so people would call out to her and I'd respond, and vice versa.

My mother was visiting me once and I went to take a shower. At around the same time, my doppelganger got done with hers and began walking to her room. My mother saw what she thought was me going somewhere not my room and called out to me and she answered. I came out to see both of them talking and my first reaction was 'mom, that's not me!'

We've stayed in touch and she's now a researcher in the same area as I am. When I was quitting my earlier job, I referred her to that team and she got hired. My old colleagues say it's like I never left.

Edit: I saw her parents at graduation. They look nothing like mine, though the resemblance to her is clear. I'm also the spitting image of my mom except for my father's jawline, so I'm not adopted either. That made it genuinely cool for me.I read ""10 years ago I went off to college"" and thought, man, you must be old.

Then I realized that I started college 11 years ago. 

:lI am a neuroscientist. In biology/medicine, we use [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to find articles, and authors are listed as ""LastName, FirstInitial SecondInitial"". I'm listed as Thompson CK. And since Thompson is such a common name, I'm not the only Thompson CK. In fact, there is another Thompson CK publishing in neuroscience, and occasionally I get emails for him, because his name is Christopher K Thompson, my exact name. 

Every year, there is one big neuroscience conference with 35,000+ attendees, and last year I emailed him to see if we can meet up. He comes to my poster, and I am just shocked at how similar her looks to me! I have two brothers, and he looks a lot more like me than either of them! Even more, he also happened to grow up in a town about 8 miles from my hometown. We both have degrees from the University of Illinois. We both really like pizza and beer. I mean, what are the chances...

Here is a [pic.](http://i.imgur.com/yoLulp0.jpg) I'm on the left. Funny enough, I had shaved my beard about 3 months prior to this pic being taken. If I'd left it on, we'd almost be twins.

And I never forget faces. Eventually I was like ""No, I never met you!""

And the response was ""Yeah, we met earlier, you are Sean from Baltimore"". And I was from Baltimore.

Turns out, there was another Sean from Baltimore staying at the hostel and meeting loads of people. 

Yeah, and he looked *exactly* like me. When we ran into each other in the hallway I instantly knew this was the dude. He looked at me the exact same way since he had been dealing with the same issue since we were both very outgoing people.

We talked for about 3 seconds and then both ran in different directions. I guess we were both freaked the fuck out that we were both Sean from Baltimore, short hair, same facial structure, same clothing style, same height, same build, same social personality...

Finally he's like ""WHAT?!"" 

""Hey man, you got a cat on your car, man!""

Poor kitty was clinging on for dear life and of course as soon as he pulled into the nearest parking lot, it shot off into the bushes to kiss solid ground. 

The lowrider followed my dad into the lot and all five young guys piled out and spent the next 10 minutes shaking bushes, crawling around, making kissy noises, and helped my dad catch the cat.

The second he drove into the madras van, causing the HUGE feather explosion, I had my first case of laughter cramps! I laughed so hard i fell down the from the couch onto our coir rug. Thinking about fact that I fell down due to uncontrollable laughing multiplied the laughing with a factor 10 and made me lose track of time and pain from the fall. My dad had to pick me up to make sure I could breath. I like to believe that this is what shaped me into being the guy I am today, always trying to make people laugh and have fun.
PS. Screw Rupert and Hubert!So who is really controlling the car? That's so Bean... at least he's buckled and using a mop responsibly.Rowan, you beautiful bastard...Mr. Bean was awesome. English wasn't my first language but that wasn't necessary to enjoy it as a kid. I LIVE, I BEAN, AND I LIVE AGAINI googled him and I cant take any picture of him seriously.

On the red carpet, news, in a suit, in a tux even on the mans goddamn wedding day. It just looks wrong.

He will always be the hilariously retarded Mr. Bean to me.Can't we just turn this into a Black Adder quote-fest.  I'll start:

""Oh dear, it's Richard III"".The PBS Chicago affiliate used to show Me Bean episodes every Sunday night when I was a kid. I loved that show.He celebrates his own show?

*By himself?*

That's............That's fucking genius Mr. Bean.I remember seeing this on pbs when I was younger...It was my first taste of brit culture. I realize now after Monty Python, Fry & Laurie, Ricky Gervais, The IT Crowd, Mitchell & Webb, etc that I may well have been born in the wrong place :) <3","{'Openness': 0.064, 'Analytical': 0.04, 'Sadness': 0.057823, 'Anger': 0.544053, 'Extraversion': 0.693, 'Joy': 0.0645, 'Agreeableness': 0.882, 'Emotional_Range': 0.952, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.084, 'Disgust': 0.045199, 'Fear': 0.575306, 'Conscientiousness': 0.169}",{'sport': 0.549834}

> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).

> The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

You heard about Pluto? It's messed up, right?wow. that ""desert"" looking area doesn't have impact craters... does that mean that there is sufficient sediment transport (wind?) on the Pluto to cover up those impacts??? simply fascinating.

**Ray**: Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me but I didn't, so it doesn't.I want that experience with every inch of my body.  How do the waffles taste with home-field advantage?Belgian here. The sugared waffle and strawberry combo you'll be able to find at pretty much every local market. Most will have a waffle stand.

Places to see when visiting:

* Ypres and the entirety of the 'Westhoek' especially nowadays with the 100 year anniversary of WW1. There are plenty of memorial sites here so you might even find a family member. Well preserved remnants of trenches, and some very nice museums.

* While you're in this area the coast isn't too long of a drive. It's a huge tourist trap but if you want try Belgian mussels then you'll find the best on the coast. All sorts of freshly caught fish and seafood can be bought on the dike at around 4-5 pm in the afternoon, when the boats come back in.

* Some of our cities have a very rich history. Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp for example were economical powerhouses in the medieval times and you still get to visit old guild houses and the like. Tongeren on the other hand is the oldest Belgian city and dates back to Roman times. Tongeren has a nice Gallo-Roman museum that sheds light on both cultures living together and merging within Belgian borders.

Local cuisine to try out. Most of it has a very countryside and homely feel to it.

* 'French' fries. Really, these things are Belgian and every town will have at least a few 'frietkoten', places that specialize in only selling French fries and other deep-fried stuff that goes with it. I recommend asking the locals for a good place. It's tough to find a place that sucks but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference in quality.

* Chocolate. If you find a chocolate shop you should definitely go and buy some real Belgian pralines. High price, but worth experiencing.

* Mussels. Best place to order this is obviously the coast, so you're guaranteed they're as fresh as can be. Most often served with fries, a bit of mayonnaise, and a special sauce just for the mussels. The mussels are basically cooked in a stewy vegetable soup with lots of spices. Shrimp are also a very loved local seafood.

* Beef carbonnade, locally known as 'stoofvlees'. I personally dislike it but most Belgians freaking love it. The sauce is often prepared with some heavy beer like a Trappiste or Tripel.

* On that note, the beer. There's a huge variety here. Some people love Jupiler, others the heavier Duvel. We have all sorts of white, blonde, and dark beers as well as fruity 'chick' beers. I'm not much of a beer guy myself but I fucking love a cold Stella Artois. Some places especially in the city will specialize in serving as many different beers as possible and they'll even serve them in the correct glass. Worth asking around if there's such a place where you're visiting. You can drink an afternoon away just exploring tastes if you're not careful.

* Other stuff I can't be bothered to describe anymore: *waterzooi, paling in't groen, pensen, ...*

* My personal favourite: *kiekerenbloed*, literally chicken's blood, which is exactly the main ingredient. It's a *very* local dish that's made by (as far as I know) mixing chicken's blood with bacon grease and baking it, then serving it with a sandwich and a dollop of mustard. [Some gentlemen enjoying a pint and a plate of kiekerenbloed.](http://i.imgur.com/ZO3UeHm.jpg)Fucking Bruges.Someday I'd like to retire to Belgium and live entirely on waffles and fries.

It's not functional, piping goes straight up, meaning most of the heat goes up the chimeny. No baffling. Dangerously hot to the touch. No ceramic tiles below it means if you open the doors your house will burn down down. Couches are too close with a fabric throw that will go up in flames. Uneven bottom will mean it will be difficult to start a proper fire. Limited (no) intake control (EDIT: Draft, I had a brainfart on that). If it's a real surplus mine it will burn through pretty quickly, constant heat will ruin the integrity of the metal. A season of maple will destroy it. Good luck opening the hatch with metal handles. Also the fire looks fake.

It's an art piece. Pure design without any function. It's a concept, and one I do really like. Looks really great.

I took a long day hike up the mountains above the hotel and found a WW1 gunnery nest. It was mid-September and already pretty damn cool up there. I jumped inside the nest and looked around. The soldiers had a nice view of the area, but they were also totally exposed. The wind whipped over the little hilltop. Then came a sudden thunderstorm. I had nowhere to hide and got completely soaked. As I high-tailed it down the mountain to my hotel, I thought about those soldiers who were stuck in that nest in winter. Holy shit, that would have SUCKED. 

I got hot coffee and drove the 17 miles to town to get new shoes (mine were muddy and filthy). Those soldiers couldn't. They were stuck in the frozen mud for weeks at a time. And now some of them are unearthing. >the remains of two Austrian soldiers found on the Presena Glacier in 2012. Photo: Office for Archaeological Finds, Autonomous Province of Trento

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/10562017/Melting-glaciers-in-northern-Italy-reveal-corpses-of-WW1-soldiers.htmlI'm starting to believe nothing in [Encino Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xkTN1Z1rTQ) was scientifically accurate! So... Can these corpses be viral carriers?Imagine that being you. Just dead, nobody knowing for sure whether you died or just never returned, nobody knowing how you died or where you were; and when your body *is* finally discovered, anybody who would've cared is dead now too.It's kind of crazy that when that guy woke up that morning he had no idea he would be killed and begin a 100 year journey through a glacier that would end in 2015 where his picture would be posted across the world for people to look at on their phones, computers, at the bus station, a restaurant, or even sitting on the toilet. I bet he would have stayed in bed had he known that. Captain Italia looks like he needs a little time to readjust They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and terrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Otto von Bismarck had ""ended"" (after a hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army to aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir of Bismarck. And my hunt for Captain America has just made a little bit more progress. Just imagine that was probably some poor woman's husband that she never heard from again...Grim? Check. 
Frost bitten? Check.
Death? Absolutely.

This content is black metal certified. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.If they were frozen in glaciers, why are they not better preserved?Now that's what I call Italian ice.Draugr de Italiana.If anyone is interested in WWI, there's an awesome channel on YouTube that has been doing videos on what happened that week 100 years ago. I highly recommend it.

I'm sure there are a few bad ones, but from experience the ones I've met have always been friendly, helpful and kind. Never have I seen one going on a power trip. They spend a lot of time actually serving the public.Netherlands mentioned?

KARMATREINI was in Amsterdam one night smoking a big joint on the street - blazed out of my mind - when two cops walked towards me. For a moment I freaked the fuck out and was about to toss my joint. Then I remembered that I was in Amsterdam. The cops just laughed at me and kept walking. Good times.Grime fighters. I think everyone is missing the point here. There are two hot cops in her house cooking and doing dishes. I don't think I've ever been more turned on. Lol. there really are good cops everywhere, just the bad cops make more headlines. 

the night my grandma passed away. she called the police because she was scared. the cops came  and sat with her for 3 hours. they didn't need to do that, but they were comforting her. those were the last two people who saw her alive unfortunately, but i'm glad there were some nice people looking out for her. 

she passed away later that night, no one could have known that was going to happen.The one on the left is a total babe. He can wash my dishes, if you know what I mean.

Goede actie.Just an FYI to the folks who are confused about hypoglycemia...most likely this woman has diabetes, probably Type I which is insulin dependent. Anyone who has this knows what a royal pain in the rear it is...constantly checking your blood sugar, adjusting your food intake, insulin intake, activity level to attempt to simulate a non-diabetic's blood sugar. Even with constant vigilance, your blood sugars can dip low or go high, for sometimes unknown reasons (is this infusion set on my insulin pump blocked? I worked a little harder raking the leaves and didn't eat enough...I have a cold, maybe that's why my glucose is high? Etc). Managing the disease is a total balancing act. This mom prob went into hypoglycemia because it was dinner time and she was going to eat soon but her blood sugar dropped too low before she got a chance to eat,and she got confused or was behaving abnormally or became unresponsive. Scary stuff. I am glad the police helped her out like they did. Serious respect for these guys. They're the model that all policeman should follow.

Also I hope at least one of them is single.And these are the guys that had to fight and go on strike to get a better CAO (collective agreement), incomprehensible. Goeie jongens.Most of redditors are from Netherlands.I was reading this thinking ""Woah! This is totally unheard of!   ... Oh, Netherlands, well then it makes sense""

Edit: I was just expressing my initial reaction to reading this. You're all right of course, that there are plenty of American police with good intentions, and it gets drowned out by either bad cops or just that it's hard to be nice when you're surrounded by gang violence...  FTP - Fix The Police ... And also inner-city/organized crimeIf this had happened in the United States the woman would have hired a lawyer and sued the cops, their department, and the city.  Well when the crime rate is so low you don't have a couple dozen report/complaint calls stacked up to go to after the current one (not to mention whenever high priority calls come in in-between) you've got time to cook dinner and do dishes. 

 Personally, I think the good cops (not the minority haring trigger happy ones) would have a much better time at ""community relations"" if they were better staffed or crime was lower.  This is probably why old people remember friendly cops who they got to know and such. Those cops has fewer calls and more time to reach out.Tijd om 112 te bellen! Ik ruik m'n afwas vanaf hier...Not gunna lie, hypoglycemia is a bitch. I lived in Eindhoven for a while and can honestly say it's one of my favourite places, if only because everyone seemed so nice and welcoming. A great country where the police doesn't have much work to do.The dutch police is awesome. I often go to big festivals in the Netherlands... and the police is always in a good mood and I've seen many times police officers dancing to the music ;-)","{'Openness': 0.18, 'Analytical': 0.107, 'Sadness': 0.047402, 'Anger': 0.782133, 'Extraversion': 0.682, 'Joy': 0.056331, 'Agreeableness': 0.627, 'Emotional_Range': 0.868, 'Tentative': 0.192, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.061973, 'Fear': 0.995135, 'Conscientiousness': 0.123}",{}

To get a mixture of the iron nickle alloy and olivine this meteorite came from a small protoplanet from the dawn of our solar system that melted from the original [chondrite](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/space/meteorites-dust/meteorite-types/stony/) material and separated into  an iron alloy and silicate phases (core and mantle). Towards the end of the protoplanet's life it experienced a very violent collision with another body and forced the contact between the core and the mantle to become perturbed via shockwaves from the impact- hence the mixing. 

Impacts like this lead to bigger and bigger bodies and eventually the terrestrial planets... so this is kind of an baby picture of the Earth.

""Miller Man"" Maquette of large sculpture for ITW Welded Steel with a marble base 24"" x 7"" x 7"" By David Madero - 

I first used a Spectrum 875 plasma cutter to cut out the initial design from a steel tube. I then used a Millermatic 252 to spot weld steel rods on the tube as a base for the texture and the welding man figure. I continued by welding the gaps and unions between the steel rods leaving a highly texturized surface.  I finished the process using a Diversion 180 tig welder to form puddles giving the hills and valleys appearance.

I'd be surprised if the mountain lion actually went for it.A mountain lion snuck up on my tent while I was camping alone in Utah a while ago. Creepiest night of my life by far.

Edit: sometime around 2 am, I was woken up by a low moan that had a slightly aggressive tone to it (the moan lasted about 10 seconds). I grew up near mountains and cows and had never heard anything like that before. 

It freaked me out and I went from dead asleep to pulse racing at maximum just about instantly. I sat up and thought and listened for maybe 10 seconds then I flung open the tent and ran for the truck. I was wearing only underwear and the truck was 50ft away. I made it and rolled down the window a bit to look and listen. 

I had no weapons on me.

Total, I camped out there in the same spot for 3 months and this happened about half way through.

Years later, I listened to mountain lion sounds on YouTube and confirmed that it was a lion. He was maybe 20 to 50 ft from my tent and I think he was kindof asking a question. He was curious and wanted to see what I was. I never saw him and never heard him again.Where was this taken?

His name is Roger Murdock, He's the co pilot.I know Simmons makes this point a lot, but look at Kareem's shoes. They are so primitive compared to today's basketball shoes. It's a real testament to Kareem's preparation and physicality that he was able to play for so long with the equipment and medicine that existed from the 60s-80s.

He also would not sleep on her side of the bed and never between the sheets once she passed. Two class acts. I'm a believer in Will being the greatest of all time, but Kareem was class all the way.

We can still tip but the tip jar is near the register and probably need to ask for it.

The incentive for good service is not getting your ass fired while someone else takes you reasonably paying job.Wow, this thread is amazing-- thanks for the attention, everyone!  My little restaurant is flattered.  Just wanted to give you guys (and particularly the servers/ cooks/ restaurant owners out there) more details on what we're doing and how we do it!

First, it's not simply an increased hourly wage!  In addition to fully funded benefits for EVERY employee, full or part time, and $15/ hour, they all get a portion of the sales.  Waitstaff get 12% of their individual sales (remember, servers used to tip out 6% of their sales, so that's like a guaranteed 18% from every table, including takeout.)  Kitchen & support staff get a percentage of the shift's sales, depending on their roles. 

It's removed the judgement, assumptions, and emotions that living off tips entailed; my servers love that.  And of course I don't take any cash they DO receive; if they do so well that someone wants to reward them extra, more power to them, that's theirs to keep.  And it happens... because my staff is incredible :)  

Come visit us in San Francisco sometime!Reddit loves a great tipping thread, but what this restaurant is saying is that ALL of their staff (bussers, dishwashers, cooks &amp; servers) are paid a living wage.  Kudos.

Serving is tough, but the kitchen is just as valuable to the dining experience. The restaurant that I work at pays minimum wage, we get tipped, but we also get profit sharing. We also get fully funded health, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) with employer match and discounts to climbing gyms and other places to boot. 

I enjoy working there.Are there any servers here that wouldn't be okay with this? My friend is a server and she says she regular makes $20+ / hour when you average her tips, and closer to $30 if she does that thing that absolutely no servers do - not reporting their tips to the IRS. That is a sweet benefits package I must say, but she's told me she'd quit serving if she ever averaged less than $20 / hr.Picture of a menu. I like the Italian way: no obligation, no forced tips, no shared jar. You liked the service exceptionally? Leave some extra money on the table when you leave. Your waiter will take it completely for himself.Redditor: ""Instead of a tip I have left you with this informative card which expains how the tip system exploits the lower class."" <tips fedora> ""M'lady.""So basically it's like how restaurants work in the entire rest of the world. USA takes another step forward!I hate the tip system in the U.S. 

As a black person, whenever I go to a restaurant, they think I won't tip, so they give me poor service. This leads me to want to tip poorly, but I still always give at least 15%. 

I wish tip wasn't part of it and it was just a fixed price.Sounds better than 

**35% Tip included in Menu Prices**so 20% markups are already included in the prices.I just went here! Really good. Really french waitress. That's OK. I'll take my tipping position which averages me around 30-35/hr.Move to Europe LOL Zazie is in SF. They're required by law to provide health insurance. It's also a California law to provide Paid Sick Leave. ""Living Wage,"" which is how much exactly? Because SF is fucking expensive and their poverty wage would go pretty far in Sacramento. I know I'm in the minority here, but I *like* the practice of tipping. It's one of the few times where I can, unilaterally, decide the value of a good or service **after** getting it. 

At the couple of restaurants where I show up at fairly regularly, I always get excellent service, they remember what I like, and treat me like I'm a valued customer. And I'm not by any means rich nor do I tip more than a pretty typical amount. 

I'd actually be disappointed to have tipping taken out of the equation in a lot of places. Define living wage...This is actually a great restaurant too. Good food, nice wine, neat ambiance. I've taken a few dates here. It's a nice spot if you find yourself in Cole Valley, SF. I'm glad we don't have tipping where I live.The fact remains that, at a flat daily wage, a busy day is worse for a waiter than a slow day.

The tip system, with all its flaws, does achieve one thing. It makes wait staff *want* the place to be bustling. It puts management and employees on the same page, keeping the place as busy as possible is how everybody gets their payday. 

When a waiter gets tips, they see a large party coming through the door and they get excited. When they don't, they see a large party coming through the door and they sigh. More work, same pay.As a hospitality worker in SF, this is as outrageous as it is hilarious.  They pay their employees $15 an hour, sounds like a lot for other parts of the country, but keep in mind that is set to be our *minimum* wage by 2017 (current minimum wage is $12.25).  Saying that is a livable wage for a restaurant in the Bay Area, nevertheless in SF itself is simply not true.  The total cost of living in San Francisco is 62.6% higher than the U.S. average, and we have the most brutal real estate/rent situation in the country right now (http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2015/06/02/san-franciscos-median-rent-hits-a-ridiculous-4225/)
A tipped position in the Bay Area allows you to make double or more than what they are paying.  Also, while I encourage them to let people know they are providing benefits and doing what ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY, but specifically discouraging any extra gratuities is silly and will hurt service in the long run.  They will lose real talent because competent and hospital servers/bartenders that go above and beyond will leave because working here is basically getting payed what you would at McDonalds.Tipping culture always confused me when I was younger and I used to visit the US a lot, having grown up in England. Here its basically set up as mentioned in the sign and the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour (although it's set to increase to £9.00 an hour) plus the government will pitch in quite generously in terms of benefits if you're stuck on minimum wage (but waiting staff normally are not, depending on the establishment). Saves a whole lot of hassle when paying though... And if you want to tip on top of that you can: for exemplary service.","{'Openness': 0.222, 'Analytical': 0.37, 'Sadness': 0.05259, 'Anger': 0.956596, 'Extraversion': 0.599, 'Joy': 0.060894, 'Agreeableness': 0.624, 'Emotional_Range': 0.788, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.081, 'Disgust': 0.05457, 'Fear': 0.049403, 'Conscientiousness': 0.173}",{'night sky': 0.908877}

It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.""

You can (and people do) climb all over the stones. 

I spent the night at Stonehenge for summer solstice 7 years ago. There were some Druid rituals - I remember a parade with flaming torches and giant furry animal heads - but mostly people were just there to party. There were drum circles everywhere, some food vendors, and lots of drinking and smoking. 

Unfortunately, it drizzled the whole time, so we didn't get to see the sunrise through the stones. But I was glad the weather forced me to wear wellies, because man, those porta potties grew increasingly biohazardous as the night wore on. Edit to change my opinion. Apparently they trash it every year and it's kinda sad. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11455098/Stonehenge-damaged-with-chewing-gum-and-graffiti-during-Winter-Solstice.htmlMy dad said that when he was a kid in the 60's, stonehenge was just this random thing off the highway, with one tiny little sign, and you just parked on the highway shoulder and walked over to it.  You could climb on it, there was some small graffiti on it, and nobody cared, because there was nobody there.

We went again as a family in 2006, and you had to park in a parking lot far away, pay an entry fee, walk through this long underground tunnel that took you underneath the highway with a bunch of infographics on the walls, then you come to stonehenge and it's all roped off with velvet and you just slowly walk around it in a circle with the group, stopping occasionally to take pictures.They left that place in ruins.This is why we can't have nice things.

What a bunch of fucking arseholes.Funny, they didn't look Druish.As a janitor, I'm impressed. After that many people this looks pretty tame. Is no one in this thread able to realise that most of the 23,000 aren't hippies and are just party-goers?also, plenty of other people. I mean, if you've got 23,000 people, some subset of them are gonna be assholes no matter what.

You could probably make this title 23,000 gamers, white people and self-stylied atheists and be equally as accurate.*Shocking* that a group of 23k people left trash on the ground. 20k out of the 23k could have cleaned up all their mess and you're still left with the mess of 3k people. >Claims to celebrate and respect the earth

>Leaves a bunch of paper/petrol-based garbage at an ancient Druid heritage site.http://i.imgur.com/tNx7nB4.gifI went to Stonehenge a few years ago and they had a rope fence up about a hundred feet from the stones because people vandalized the stones. 
then people do shit like this, nothing pisses me off more than seeing a place people hold sacred trashed by 23k of the absolute scum of society. I think most of them aren't really hippies or druids, just people who like a party.Gotta love that Hipster hypocrisy ;) ""But man, we love mother earth! She is so beautiful, lets throw our trash all over it.""

You've missed the photo where loads of people stayed behind to clear up. This is disgusting.If anyone's ever been they'll know it's mainly populated by local chavs looking for an excuse to get wrecked. Not trying to defend their actions here but I bet if you put a group of 23000 of anybody it would look the same.I was there for the whole event and I can tell you there were people from all social circles. There were plenty of new-agers and hippies but they were heavily outnumbered by the general public.

The event is part of a religious holiday that's open to anyone and although there were volunteers picking litter, you have to expect some debris from 23,000 people moving in and around the stones.

Otherwise it was an absolutely electric night, people chanting, playing bongos and dancing around the circle into the early hours was amazing to see. I even saw a guy playing a saxophone to one of the stones.I was there

I am there every year

Loads of local chavs and non hippies turn up to get fucked up and ruin the vibe. Don't blame the hippies because we make up less than half of the people there - after the sunrise all the non-hippies leave and then you'll see what the summer solstice celebrators are really like!I was there at the 2015 summer Solstice, I was there with my friends just to see what all the hype was about.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7mRg74qcY&feature=youtu.be) of this bitch in action.A gif of the little thing 

http://static.businessinsider.com/image/556cd32d69bedd3c21964422/image.gifv>While the device may look like a toy, its certainly not priced like one. The PD-100 Black Hornet 2 prices at about $40,000 for larger orders of the device, said Ole Aguirre, VP of business development for Prox Dynamics. But considering that the Pentagon plans to spend approximately $2.9 billion on unmanned systems for the fiscal year of 2016, according to the Drone Center at Bard College, the $40,000 price tag doesnt seem so significant.

So in other words its a drop in the sieve.russia is ready: http://imgur.com/a83Ewgchttp://imhur.com/a/a1RHO6s.jpgI'm just happy that MiMS found a new job.There's more to that $40,000 package than just the PD-100 Black Hornet 2.  That case hanging off the guys chest houses the display and base station for it.

For what it's worth, it's not a bad little drone.  While it looks low tech it has 3 camera's, has a 2 mile range, can hit 22 mph and has a 25 minute flight time.  Perfect for the types of missions it's designed for, which primarily being spec ops missions, means it's not like they are going to buy so many of these that it dents the nearly $3B unmanned systems budget for next year.

EDIT:  Also worth noting, the British Army has already invested in these, and I believe the Australians have as well.  I also think that the drone itself is cheap and most of the money is in the ruggedized base station and software.  The company advertises the drone itself as ""Affordable - reusable and disposable"" which leads me to believe that replacing the drone itself is probably something more on the order of one of the CICADA systems drones, far cheaper than $40k.Should've waiting for the Black Friday deal. No army deals for Turkey day.This will get buried, but my idiot brother is the one holding the drone in this picture.  When I called him to tell him he made the front page of Reddit and was basically a celebrity, he responded with:  

""...  Cool...  What's Reddit?""Makes me wonder if they have Drones disguised as bugs now that they using to spy on people with. Hence why the Russians supposedly stop talking when they see a fly in the room.If the manufacturer sold more than 50 of them, the price probably would be closer to what we'd expect to pay ourselves. The Noisy Cricket. ""I feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing!""

Edit: Thank you for gilding my first ever comment.Haha... As much as I hate seeing expensive items on my property books that are cheaper in the civilian side... The prices on those items also reflect the entire package of service, maintenance, updates, repairs... As well as contribute to the contractor support when you need a person to come instruct or provide hands on service. 

Ofc this varies between items, but for items sold to the government a lot of the expenses are passed directly into the govt because they will pay it. If a business provides something they need, the govt can always justify the cost of whatever the business says it had (eg it took me 400,000 dollars to make the tools to make this drone, I need to sell it to you for 40,000 to break even or make money on this since you're buying such a limited number of them) You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?Carbon fiber blades, gold plated axis, 4K live streaming camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, 2-40Hz microphone, ultrasound and infrared sensors, stealth absorption paint, facial recognition software with target auto detect and auto follow, satellite communication, radar jammer, micro laser canyon, stun/freeze ray, not to mention that the contractor, designers and builders need to pass FBI background checks and DoD clearance so it all adds up to US$45,392.13 - Bald Eagle Freedom discount of US$5,392.13 = US$40,000.00.

[From another angle](http://i.imgur.com/WO3Np9e.jpg)One of the reasons why Canada built CANDU reactors is because we don't have steel forges the built giant reactors like this.  CANDU reactors are stacked in smaller modular sections.  It was important to the people in charge at the time we build the reactor ourselves to have something to be proud of.  Footage of forging at a similar scale. Pretty mind blowing.

I mean, that thing's massive. Just how incredible is it that we are capable of doing things like this?Bit of a mislead; it's actually the reactor pressure vessel which will ultimately contain the core structure. But yes, it is massive! About 4m diameter and can be up to about 12m tall!

Marketer here.

You aren't their target audience. 

These magazines do TONS of market research or ""testing"" behind the scenes. They interview dozens upon dozens of people behind closed doors and ask them random questions. A lot of the answers given may seem bullshit to us, but market research is about picking up on the ""language"" that your target audience uses today. Hence, you see a difference in the way weight loss is described in the latter version. Same thing, but their target audience now describes their pain points in a different lingo. 

I bet this magazine conducted hundreds of interviews and picked up on pain points, the way their readers think and talk, how they describe situations, etc before they even released this cover.

It's actually SUPER easy to conduct market/customer/user research now. In the past, companies had to do in person interviews and focus groups in order to understand their target audience. That would take WEEKS to organize and conduct... Super slow process and quite frankly, dreadful. Now they go to companies like UserTesting and launch a quick, remote test and within 20 minutes have all the research they need.

Saline bottle of vodka in armpit.  Been doing that at Heinz Field for around 10 years.  ;)I dont know how many beer bottles I fit in my ass, but I'm going to find out.Does no one go to sports events or concerts? 

At the arena in my city, draft beer is $8 or $12 depending on size. $15 no, but not far off. 

Beer is always overpriced at arenas and stadiums. Wow! Only $7.00 for a Bud Light!You paid $3000/ticket to get in. A $15 beer should be chump change to you. Ahh, the Norwegian price A good opportunity for a drone delivery business, if they hadn't already threatened to shoot them down.Those are Strip Club prices!And people will pay those prices so why the fuck notI'm more interested in the hot dog prices.

It's cafeteria in TCS, an IT company. Many companies display such data in the cafeterias.We did this at my summer camp to make kids aware of food wastefulness and not taking more than they'd eat. Went from over 150 lbs of wasted food the first day down to 45 by the end of camp. Guess they're also serving up guilt there.Near me there are a few ""All You Can Eat Sushi"" spots.

They will not serve you more until you clear everything on your plate. If you don't eat everything that came out, you can't order more. You also can't take it home.

This actually pissed me off the one time I went there with some people a while back. They make you order as a table. I'm very specific with sushi, so I ordered 2 or 3 specific rolls for myself, but when I finished they wouldn't let me order more because the table wasn't finished.

You see, the other people at my table were ... well ... idiots. They thought, ""Hey, it's all you can eat! Lets just order everything, even the stuff that doesn't sound appealing!"". 

They ordered more food than anyone could eat, didn't end up finishing it, and as a result I couldn't order more. I even asked the waitress if I could go on my own separate bill, to which they said, ""One table, one bill"".

They wasted a ton of food that night, and I was probably the only person in the history of an ""all you can eat"" restaurant who went home hungry.250g doesn't sound like a particularly big meal for those 180 peopleTata Consultancy Services. Our motto: ""I'm not a doctor, but I'll take a look.""You sure this is a restaurant? Looks more like an office cafeteria [deleted]In general,  the solution would be to switch to smaller plates. People are lazy and they will avoid doing many trips to the bar. That is the ugliest number 5 I've ever seen. Fuck I'm tired. I originally saw wastage and thought that this was written in German or something However, that wouldnt have actually fed anyone. It instead saves the company money and gives them more profit. They are playing on your emotions for their gain.

Im a little cranky this morning apparently lol.[In other words: Don't do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCLXZmMQNs)i know some all you can eat places get around this by charging a fee if your plate isnt empty when you ask for the bill. which i think is perfectly acceptable, wasting food is a shame. 

edit: to the people whining, or saying what if i have 1 shrimp on my plate, use some common sense people. if you have a few small items, or stuff half eaten cause you didn't like it you wont be charged normally. it's the people who've had 3 plates are pretty full but think they can do one more round fill a plate and leave it half full. 

and to the people saying how do they charge you for it? well buffets are a set price, when your bill comes there will be a fee on top, it's not rocket science.. I wonder if this is 100% actual foods that you could have actually fed 180 people with or if they just weighed the waste bin... It's ironic this is a sign at Tata. Fuck this company and everything it stands for.But is it gonna feed 180 people, if it wasn't wasted? What are they gonna do with leftovers at the end of the day?A retaurant in my town makes you pay double if they see you wasting too much food. If you don't pay, they kick you out. Not like we would waste anything on the first place, but there will always be assholes.We did a similar thing when I went to school. The cafeteria had a clear tube that red balls were placed in for every x kilo thrown in the waste baskets. There was also a mark on the tube, and if we were lower than the mark by the end of the year, everyone would get ice cream.Do they weigh just the edible waste or are they including bones and shells?  If the former, who's separating these?  They should also post their profit for full transparencyTCS...   the sweatshop of the consultancy world...Buffet by definition is wasteful, they can take their side order of guilt and shove it. I wonder how effective this sign is...I love the ""do it for the environment"" or ""do it for starving people"" marketing...when it is really ""do it so that we can reduce our costs"".

I just hope he doesn't suffer any extreme health issues.Somebody call John Green! Little known fact, if you feed elephants lots of cheese that slows down their metabolism slightly and can, in very extreme cases, lead to dwarfism. The cheese can do this due to the way the enzymes in the cheese react with the elephants special type of stomach acid.

Everyone else was either sleeping or partying, so I had the top deck to myself.  I laid back and wrapped a towel around my face to cut out any artificial light, and just had the most amazing time. I saw one big fireball that just took my breath away. 

When I returned home, I saw this picture on Reddit. I wondered if it was the same fireball. I thought maybe the photographer and I shared the same moment, he in the beautiful cold wilderness of Canada, and me out in the warm waters of the Caribbean, both of us staring out into the starlit blackness. Then suddenly a streak of multicolored fire races across the sky. Where is this?*sighs* can someone fetch the Doctor? There's a rip in the fabric of the universe again.Now *THAT'S* a fireball!

There were no street lights I walked on a gravel road. All of a sudden. I could see everything around me. I saw a group of deers on a field. At first I thought a helicopter or something light everything up with a beam or whatever. Then I looked up and it looked like a huge scar in the night sky. It was incredibly bright, and it grew really fast. After which it stopped and slowly faded away. Probably something you only see once in a lifetime.

Mostly because of the fight your traffic ticket companies abusing it.The airport staff here use cars that say ""Law Enforcement (supporter)"" with lettering so small you would barely notice that last part:
https://imgur.com/B1i4MeaA friend of mine from high school bought an all black Crown Vic with the rambar still installed.

To the guy with the suggestion it should be to protect and seal I beg to differ. To paint and protect is synonymous with to serve and protect and has double meaning. We work mostly in Toronto and west GTA. For those who's business we'd lose solely based on this - I wouldn't want your business anyway.There's thousands of painters in the GTA.

It was in the early to mid 1990s in Riverside California. I was standing outside of a backyard party ($3 at the gate). I think the Voodoo Glow Skulls or the Assorted Jelly Beans or Schlong or some other stupidly-named band was going to play. 

So I was outside I was,  waiting for some friends when from down the street came a slow moving car with a search light. Pandemonium broke out because the party was about to be busted. Shouts of ""five-oh! five-oh!"" were heard. People took off in every direction. They jumped over the back fences. I even heard someone tried to put the keg in the washing machine. 

So I'm out there and I'm afraid of nothing because I'm straight and I don't have pockets full of marijuana or speed.

This glaring error upsets me more than it should. My car wouldn't start. So I took it to my Ford dealership because I had 150$ credit. They said it was my battery. I paid 100$ for it because it had a long ass warranty and I was like fuck it. Next day it didn't start again. They said it was my alternator and it would cost 700$. I told them that is insane and hung up. They called back and said they talked to their manager and took 5% off. I laughed and hung up.

I installed the alternator myself for total of 120$ and 30Min to an hour of work. This being my first time looking at youtube videos.

Turns out that wasn't it.

I took it to a mom and pop shop and they fixed it in 4ish hours (dropped it off before work)for 100$ total and said the air condition was drawing power.

The Ford dealership makes money on commission. My theory was they were going to claim it was the alternator and charge me 200-300% overcharge and then fix the air conditioning problem and claim it was the alternator.

Fuck those crooks.Not bad. At the dealership I get my car serviced at they tried to hit me up for $1,900 in bullshit. All I needed was a 25k mile service. I thought out loud and asked him ""are you fucking serious?"". I could see the terror in his eyes and that's worth more than any gift card.Now come get your air filter so we can sell you something else and charge you up on labor to make up for the gift cards.Wow!  That's a pretty great decision on their end.  I'd do business with them.  Cabin air filters are like $10 and can be changed in like 5 minutes.

http://imgur.com/PLdA307Brooklyn Supreme is NOT the world's biggest horse!

The ""biggest"" horse on record is Sampson, a Shire horse 21.2 hands high by the time he was a four year old, when he was re-named Mammoth. His peak weight was estimated at 3,360 lb.  He was born in 1846, before Brooklyn was ever born.

Brooklyn ""only"" stood 19.2 hands high.  

The record-holder for ""biggest horse"" as of 2007 was a Shire horse named Tina who was 20 hands high.  Tina died in 2008 and was subsequently beaten by Big Jake, who is 20 hands *plus two and three-quarter inches* and still alive, holding the current record.  Big Jake weighs only 2,600 pounds compared to Sampson, but Guinness no longer records ""biggest"" by weight, but by height, so although Jake is much trimmer than either Brooklyn or Sampson, he still holds the title.

Edit: a ""hand"" is 4 inches.
That horse never skipped leg day. Or any day.Beautiful horse, horrible feet. His toe is so long, Id imagine he had a hard time moving especially considering his massive size. Imagine trying to walk with swimming flippers on your feet all day long!When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

What's crazy is that Minnie Mae outlived pretty much all of her family--Elvis,  Vernon, they all died before her. Dang, if you need a wikipedia image for ""withering stare"" this pic will probably do the trick.That haircut isn't regulation at all...but it should be.His dad looks like the T-1000 traveled back and ate too many peanut butter banana sandwiches> **milk**

Concise and accurate. Excellent marketing.If anyone is wondering what patch he is wearing, it's the patch of the 3rd Armored Division(Tank Division)Interesting that Minnie has a hairstyle suited to the 20s and 30s. Kinda like our grandma's nowadays have hairstyles from the 50s and 60s. Man, Elvis was a damn stud.Elvis is the coolest motherfucker there ever was. His dad looks like a bad ass too, and grandma looks like she's gonna whup the photographer's ass for taking pictures at the dinner table. Minnie Mae straight out of American Gothicthe wrong kid died!I miss the way foods were labeled in the 50s. What it was was more important than who made it. A tin of black pepper. A carton of milk. A box of... premiums.Pretty sure that's Ray Liotta Elvis guy here.

What strikes me is how modest the setting here is.  At this point Elvis was the biggest name in the world, with multiple #1 records and hit movies. He was already a pioneer in music (with several ""first"" concept albums already done) and basically the most famous entertainer in the world.

By 1959, Elvis beloved mama was dead and Vernon had already remarried (a woman who quickly asserted herself as the new matriarch of the family, much to Elvis' displeasure. She and Vernon lived in GRaceland with Elvis for a time but after she rearranged the furniture and changed the drapes, which Gladys had picked out, Elvis moved all her stuff out and sent her down the road to live with Vernon in a nearby house).


It's unclear to me where this picture was taken but it doesn't appear to be Graceland. The house changed a lot between 57-77 but this doesn't look anything I've seen. It may be Vernonshouse.

The point is, despite already having an obscene amount of money and a willingness to spend it freely on his loved ones, the  environment here is still so modest. It's partially because of the era and partially because. Elvis' family grew up so dirt poor that even this was considered a significant step up.Christ he's photogenic isn't he?Her head looks way too small for her body. She's on the same level as the Koopas in the Mario Bros movie.Was this before or after he stole his iconic dance off Forrest Gump?I bet you that was a damn good breakfast too. Oh, Minnie... You so fine, you so fine you blow my mind.Wow, Vernon looks just like [Robert Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Patrick) who played Johnny Cashs father in Walk the Line.TIL Nabisco hasn't changed the packaging of their saltine crackers in half a century.Thought it said his dad's name was ""Venom"".

What are we talking- $40 each?  $50 maybe?The sanding...oh god, the sanding...TIL: *Brown Oak is technically not a distinct species of oak, but rather refers to oak (almost always English Oak or another European species) that has been infected with a fungus. This fungus (Fistulina hepatica) has the effect of turning the wood a deep brown color. Once the wood has been cut and dried, the fungus dies, leaving a rich golden brown lumber.*

It took him a year and a half to complete.

 As he worked his hands hurt and he felt tired. At times he wanted to cut corners and go home early. But did he? No, he worked harder and more diligently than ever. The sweat boiled from his face as he toiled. Final he was done.

 He showed the chair to his boss the next morning. ""Jim this is the finest work you have ever done."" His boss was very pleased. ""Why did you work on it so hard Jim?""

 ""Because the customer who buys this will live with it for a lifetime."" ""Through good times and bad, through all the seasons and all Hollidays. Memories will be made. Memories maybe I didn't get to make myself."" 

Tom looks at Jim and with a tear in his eye and says ""The chair is yours Jim."" ""The chair is yours Jim.....""

In fact, I see that bushes are growing in the car-park area, but in distinct lines, probably where cars didn't park or drive.
Where is this??The last movie I saw at a drive in was a double feature. Free Willy, and The Fugitive. Man I remember going to these :\

I first saw MI2 at a drive in.This is some post apocalyptic Revolution or Walking Dead style reclamation from civilization.

Never opened that window in the 10 years I lived there, but small price for having bats for roommates I guess.Cool.  So, she built her nest in between the screen and the window?  How did she get up in there?  Was there a curtain or something up against the window?  It seems like she'd feel kind of exposed...You can see where they keep their nutsThat's really cute!

I found him barely breathing and the mom dead right next to him. Took me 9 days to find a shelter, lazy but at the same time wanted to see him recuperate before I brought him there. I don't trust paws and other entities like them. 

Edit: tried to leave him in my backyard when he was walking again, no squirrel adopted him but now the squirrels in the neighborhood will come up to my porch and take nuts out of my hand.

Double edit: not necessarily lazy just took me a few days to find a place then get time, took 2 hours to drive there. Also, thanks so much for the gold. Nerve thought that would've happened in my life.

I had a dove make a nest in the saddle bag of my bicycle stored on my porch, and so for several months I literally had an inside view to the whole egg laying, chicks hatching, mama feeding, and babies leaving the nest. It was a once in a lifetime experience.

Unless the guy who designed it was named Elvin...That's not even a mansion. It's the boathouse at Camp Topridge!

https://localwiki.org/hsl/Camp_Topridge

Now that's what I'm Tolkien about.Honestly, I think that's just a boat house. Or a boat house with a guest cabin. Also known as the Adirondack Architectural style. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Architecture [I knew i'd seen this house somewhere before - Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO6BgrnXcA&t=14m48s)House of Cirdan, the Shipwright.That woodwork is on pointde_lakeThat's a boathouse, not a ""private marina"".Looks like the Adirondacks.This definitely reminds me of the one of the inns in WoW. It's been years so I don't remember its name but it was in the level 10ish+ area near Darnassus.

Edit: I believe it is Auberdine that I am thinking of.But would you live there rent free if you had to give up Facebook? [Let me set the mood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yLjsWTNeE)If my hunt-and-seek games have taught me anything, there's a hidden microfiche in that house, and the boathouse has a spear, a starfish, a watering can, an umbrella, a mirror compact, a kitten, a  fish hook, three scarves, a TV remote, a flowered headband, a baby's rattle, and two pieces of a torn up photo in it.Honest question. What happens if the water level rose/dropped say 5-10 feet? I don't know about this area but around here thats pretty common throughout the year. Does the house float up to compensate? Is nothing kept on the lower level with the dock and they just let that flood? What if it rises over that level? Just curious if anyone knows.I work in this area often. This is Camp Topbridge on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondack Park of NY State. I turned in a quest there once where I had to kill 10 diseased boars.This is no mansion, it's a boathouse. Also a marina is a yacht mooring or harbor, this is probably suitable for a very small uncovered powerboat at most and, more likely, serves primarily to house paddle boats of various kinds.Oh to have money...I see the house in When Marnie Was There.

That's just creepy.That's fucking dopeHey, mate. I don't want to burst your bubble, but the word ""clients"" just made me have to log in and post this. Please don't tell me you're charging people for photography of this quality. If you are just mucking around and taking photos for friends, that's fine (and I hope you're enjoying yourself!). But you should not be allowing people to put faith in you (and give you probably large sums of money) to document what might be the biggest event in their life when you are clearly not qualified to perform this work.

If you can look past the god-awful quality/sharpness/resolution of the image (are you using consumer gear or a point and shoot?) and even further past the basic compositional errors (have you ever studied any other wedding photography before?) the photos still don't appear to have any of effort put into colour correction, cropping, lens issue correction, or any other kind of post production.

You should be less concerned about slipping in ""clever"" reflections, and actually focus on learning how to use a camera. You are far, far from the point where you should be watermarking your images and calling yourself a professional.

Sorry, I hope I wasn't too mean. I just can't hack it when people like you shit all over the profession that some of us have sunk decades into.

This was before mythbusters existed and proved that to be completely idiotic. Hopefully these trash masters faired better.25 year old here:

would love to swing again without my feet hitting the floor.I'm from Bogotá, Colombia, and this happened in my city. :) I like to think that this is more than just a few garbagemen taking a break at the swing set. I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. ""I'm afraid of swings"" he responds. ""Why"" his friend asks, ""did you have an accident while you were young?"" ""No!"" he exclaimed, ""I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing"". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, ""look how high I can go!"". 

Did that happen? probably not. 
Was there any point to that story? Nope!
 But did you read it? Well, only *you* can answer that question!Why am I only seeing Luigis?I always try to do this when I pass by a park. A guy I was dating told me to get off of the swing and that I was too old for that. That was awhile ago. We are no longer dating.

I wish I could see the signature, as I likely know the doctor in question!

My own GP hates requests for sick notes. I once called in sick a single time in a six month period, and was asked for a note. Spitefully, my GP wrote me off for three weeks in a glorious August, filling in the ""reason for absence"" section as ""None of your goddamn business. Confidentiality trumps bullshit policy."" That was the last time I was asked for a sick note.
 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! If you ever need health care in Halifax I'll be sure you get a real saline drip, not the bagged harbour water were usually use!Yep I just show up sick, do a really half-assed job, spread the illness around then go home. The American way.This is the perfect way to deal with that kind of policy.

Calm and understanding tone to maintain rapport. Expose the extra work and problems it causes. Mirror the absurdity by requiring an equally useless piece of work from them. Invoice them for the unnecessary cost. Appeal to the sense of community they (probably unknowingly) betray by outsourcing the cost of their organizational distrust for employees to other businesses.

Great lesson in diplomacy, right here.I do find it kind of silly that companies require a Doctors note if you are sick.

My company does this and I always cringe when I have to tell the employee that policy requires a doctors note if they call in sick more than a day or two.
If someone has the flu, stay the hell home. I don't care, we'll figure shit out.
Sure if you tell me you have a physical injury, I need a note and instructions from your doctor on what you can do when you get back for those who have positions that require physical labour, but if you just had the flu? Stay the hell home, I don't really care.
In the end most of them are paid hourly, if it isn't busy season...you are saving me money.
It's more of a deterrent for people who BS sick days, but it doesn't really work there either. Since they'll find a doctor to fill that stuff out regardless, so you're just wasting everyones time.

My dad used to work in an ER in Nova Scotia. He said it was completely fucked. So many people with very minor issues clogging everything up.Years ago I was a server and the flu hit me while I was working Handling food, drinks, silverware... GM sent me home seeing for himself I was really sick and said don't come in tomorrow. I was supposed to work the following 3 days. I did not show up the next day but by the third I was feeling better and came in. 

The MOD asked for my doctors note. I did not go to the doc nor could I afford the $150 to go to the walk-in clinic. She fired me on the spot leaving the floor short a server. 

The GM called 4 days later asking me WTF? I explained everything to him and he fired the MOD. 

EDIT: GM did not call me 4 days later but 4 days after the initial ""go home you're sick"". 1 day after the firing.Good on that doctor. Fantastic. I remember waiting with my wife in a walk-in clinic for four hours so she could be seen for 2 minutes so she could buy a note from the doctor's office for a flu. Biggest waste of time ever, but her company required itI got written up at an old job for refusing to give them a note. It was worth it to me- I'm not going to the doctor for a migraine, there's nothing they can do, it's just going to cost me more money on top of the money I'm losing by being unable to work.Whats even stranger is friends and family telling me to see a doctor. Its a fucking cold!That's the most Canadian ""fuck you"" I've ever seen. Bravo. Sick notes are for teenagers in high school, not middle aged employees. And they're nonsense anyway. I know what a 24hr stomach virus looks like. I know I don't need a doctor for it. Why the heck should I drag myself to a doctor's office unnecessarily just to appease my company's paranoia.I work in a hospital, and the policy here is essentially ""come in sick or it counts against you"".  Obviously, they don't say that, and they don't want us to work while sick, but they still ding you for calling out (even with a doctor's note).

So, we work around sick patients, which means we're likely to get sick, and we're less likely to call out, so we're likely to make our co-workers sick.  The whole thing is stupid.Instead of asking medical note because of abuse of sick leave benefit, why don't companies hire people they trust? 

If you trust your employees so little that you need to treat them like liars when they call in sick then you need to reconsider your hiring practices.Good for that doctor. I despise the sick note policies that so many companies have.  

I was once so sick with the flu that I genuinely couldn't get out of bed to go see my doctor to get a note, so I went back a couple of days later when I was feeling better to ask her for the note my manager required. I obviously wasn't sick anymore, so she just asked me what dates I was sick and wrote the note accordingly.  

So clearly it doesn't matter if I'm actually sick or not, as long as my doctor will vouch for me. But I have to be a drain on the healthcare system either way. I worked for a retail art supply store, and they brought in a new manager who decided to implement a similar policy of requiring a note if you called in sick.  I told him it cost money and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket for something like that, especially because I had already lost a days wages (no sick days), and was only making $8.50/hour.  He said that I wouldn't be re-imbursed, so I said ""no"".  Nothing more was said. I like the doctors note though, anything which put the responsiblity for such a paternalistic, and wasteful policy back on the employer. 

Its ironic isn't it, an employer generally wants a note to make sure the employee isn't being irresponsible and playing hooky; but the reality is that the request itself is far more irresponsible in its actual effect when you consider the extra strain it puts on the health care system.  

TL; DR= The dr. nailed it.I'm sorry, but screw demanding doctors' notes unless it's an extended illness.

""Oh, you're feeling sick today? NOW YOU MUST GO OUT OF YOUR HOME INSTEAD OF RESTING UP AND PAY A $50 COPAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING SICK.""

How about, if you don't trust your employees enough to believe them when they call in, you're a moron for employing them?I was home due to chicken pox this week and last week.

I work in IT, specifically as a senior DBA. I told them I would be out for 2 weeks but would be fully capable of working from home.

The following happened:

 - Boss required me to bring in a doctor's note with the diagnosis and expected return date.
 - Did not give me permission to work from home (yet made the expectation of such clear)
 - Made it quite clear that, in no uncertain terms, if I didn't have a note, I'd be dismissed for work abandonment.

I informed said boss that so long as I was chewing up sick time, I would not, for any reason what-so-ever, log into the VPN. At no point would I answer any pages nor emergency alerts. I informed him he was welcome to talk to HR / Legal about my stance and who was in the right.

This is the week that the cluster decided to have problems.

I can't wait to tell him that in another week I'm going to be out again for a gall bladder removal.

Like a dimestore hooker without any customers.If my job search is any indication this letter will never get read by any human person and the Dr. will get an automated reply saying ""thank you for applying but the position has already been filled.""Yeah that's bullshit. You're not a fucking child. Funniest part about sick notes is 99% of the time I'm sick because of the poor sanitation policies around your nasty work place.Problem is call centres dont give a fuck. Its an awful place to work the company knows it is so they do this to prevent people from taking stress days and such because not having every possible person on the phones hurts their business. Every call centre says that they are better than the rest but all of them eventually treat you like numbers and not like human beings.The best part here in the states is requiring a note when your company doesnt offer health insurance.

This was taken in Etosha National Park, Namibia [edit: detailed location removed, see comments below]. I waited at a waterhole for 7 hours from noon to 7pm. There was very little wildlife activity during the afteroon, and only a few springboks showed up to drink. At around 6pm the sky was still overcast and I almost decided to leave, but eventually decided to stay until the end of the day. The real show started around 6:30pm as the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.

I went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.

I travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience. Go if you ever get the chance!

Finally I have a [photography website](http://www.johangeorget.com) for those who wish to see pictures of this trip. I hope no one will mind me that I share the links here.

[Here is an image of what it looked like in 1840](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Heidentor_%28Stich%29.jpg) and here is an [image made in 1655](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Heidentor_c_beuttler.jpg).

It is amazing to realize that the latter picture, that is over a century older than the USA, was made when the monument was already a ruin over a millennium old.wooops!  Looks like the builders colored outside of the lines.They would be funny if they drew in some drunk Roman guy passed out against the wall of the building Wait, is that... is that ""Real Life augmented Reality""? That is a great idea!In one of M.J.Fox's movie, when he was about to build an own hotel, he used the same idea. I always wondered why this isn't more frequently in open areasGreat idea, want to see more of this in Rome. So, how do they know what it originally looked like?  It's been in ruins for a thousand years and not like they had pictures to go offA little more info on the display:

This display at Carnuntum is the only one of its kind on this site. It is even meant as a temporary display since sooner or later the Heidentor (heathen's gate) is supposed to be rebuilt following original Roman building style.

They have a very nice museum at the excavation site nearby where they already have a few fully functional Roman buildings that were rebuilt in the original style and with original materials.

Carnuntum is a fascinating excavation site with a very cleverly built museum which constantly improves.

During summer they have some festivities there and at their sister site ""Bad Deutsch Altenburg"". They show Gladiator fights, Roman army training, Roman lifestyle in general.

The site is about half an hour drive from Vienna and definitely worth a visit. Entry fees are moderate and the ticket is valid for the three main sites: Museum Carnuntum, Museum Bad Deutsch Altenburg, and the ""Amphitheater"" Bad Deutsch Altenburg.What if ruins have always been in the state they are now? Like they were built as a way to engage a ruse on the future generations.It kinda irks me that it isn't exactly lined upFor anyone wondering, the word ""Augenhöhe"" on the ride side means eye height, so you get a feeling for how big the ruin wasHow they looked.  What they looked like.This is a very informative view.

I was in Seattle for business last summer. The first 4 days I was there, the weather was what you think of as typical for Seattle: grey and cloudy.

On the morning of my 5th day there, the clouds cleared out and it became sunny, so I went for a walk around the building I was working in, as I had done every day. 

I turned the corner of this building and I was totally taken by surprise by Mt. Rainier just appearing on the horizon. I'd looked in that direction the last 4 days and seen nothing, so I was so shocked by the size of it. It looked totally fake, towering over the landscape by itself, and I just stood there, staring at it for about the next 5 minutes. It was one of the most beautiful and awe inducing things I ever seen.

""Oh, you'll know."" You don't realize how huge the thing is until you see it for yourself!
so if Mt. Ranier is 60 miles away from Seattle, and a pyroclastic flow travels at 500 mph, and Bob, who is having lunch at Pike Place  stares at the beautiful exploding mountain for 30 seconds before running to his car which just happens to be right outside, how far can Bob get before he's suffocated by searing gas and choking ash as he watches the city disappear?

If anyone is wondering, you get this type of effect by using a zoom lens (like 200 or 300mm) and zooming in, which makes images in the distance appear much bigger. Photos like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/rEIhvQt.jpg) are also created with this method.

I think I'd try killing myself after the first decade.Wow. this doesnt make it better but atleast its not
Oklahoma and he's still alive How people can go through something like that without coming out the other end nearly insane and full of hatred and blood-lust for the pieces of shit that put them there, I don't understand. How can you have 27 years of your life taken from you, not to mention spending those 27 years years in a cage with human scum, and not want vengeance? Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from ToledoThe look on his face says it all. Obviously it's great that he was finally exonerated, but this picture makes me sad. You know in those 27 years he has missed so much of his life. No amount of money could fix it, but he deserves billions. I'm 25, he's been in prison longer than I've been alive. No idea if he has kids, but he definitely has(had?) parents. Imagine losing your family for 27 years. Not to mention everyone you know thinking you're a murderer. So so sad.You would be surprised how many innocent are locked up.The face of a man who has been tried.The look on his face says it all. That's 27 years of pain and anguish for a mistake that wasn't his.That man's face. Holy shitI'll point out the case of Ronald Cotton since it hasn't been mentioned yet. He only received $111,000 from the state of South Carolina after being wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade. His case also showed us a few things about handling witness testimony in law enforcement. Firstly, the victim of the crime had said she dedicated all of her effort during her rape to memorizing her attackers face; she identified cotton with certainty as her attacker, and he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Second, the investigators of her case made affirming statements to her following her indication of cotton as her rapist, causing her to believe her choice was the correct one. There were also inconsistencies in the investigation such as the line-up procedure that was used and an improper alibi given by cotton during his first interrogation being the only other piece of evidence used against him. CBS made a documentary about this story called [picking cotton](http://youtu.be/-2oDRfj0vME)source:

Poor guy. I believe he will be compensated handsomely for wrongful imprisonment though. Won't get him back all those wasted years or ease the pain of missing out on a lot of his life, but at least it should help him restart his life or depending on his age have a nice retirement. Ohio: 
$40,330 per year (or amount determined by state auditor) in addition to lost wages, costs, and attorney's fees. So a minimum of $1,088,910.Wouldn't be surprised if this was another case of false accusation from ""eye witnesses""Has anyone noticed the look on this mans face, or was everyone sidetracked by money talks?  The emotions being expressed here are so complex that just this millisecond snapshot of what he was feeling sent shivers through me.  I'm glad this man was released.  I can't even begin to imagine what sort of indignities this man suffered through for 27 years, but I'm sure no amount of money will ever compensate for it.  wow. Im 28, he spent pretty much all of my life in jail. Ive experienced to much wonder and wildness....all while he was locked up. My heart hurts for these peopleI went to a play called ""The Exonerated"" once about people who were locked up for crimes they didn't commit. People would be shocked and disgusted how often this happens. 

I can't even imagine how this guy feels. Imagine, when he went in it was the '80s. So much has changed and he's just been sitting in a cell. The people who go back and work on getting these people exonerated are really heroes. This is why we shouldn't have a death penalty. Think of all the guys that were extinguished instead of exonerated.That is truly upsetting. Can you even imagine? You did not do this thing, this terrible thing - murder - that they say you did. And then you go to jail for life. The thought that you are going to rot in jail forever for something you did not do. How quickly would you lose all hope? And then 27 years later, maybe after you've relinquished any and all thoughts of a life outside of prison, you come to find that you will be freed. 

All of the emotions he is experiencing, I cannot even fathom. I just want to give him a hug. 

This makes me want to be a lawyer and fight for people who are wrongfully imprisoned. No money can recover what that man lost. 27 years is about how long I've been alive. Think of all that time. He lost his chance at a career. At seeing the rise of the internet and tech. He lost his youth. He lost his reputation, his freedom. He probably lost himself. You don't spend nearly 3 decades in prison and not come out a different man. The system didn't take away 27 years of his life. The system took his soul. The system took everything that he ever was and ever could have been.

What's a million dollars to all of that?As a corrections officer, this is why I treat every person under my care as though they are innocent. Because some of them *are*.Sweater vest.

I didn't know I woke up this morning to go on a feel trip...What is the source on this?""Animals don't have feelings and emotions the way we do""

...yeah... often they're better at it.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_(cat) 

Wikipedia page on Scarlett, the cat pictured here, the fire was in 1996 when she was a year old and she survived until 2008. 12 years is a fairly good innings for a cat, especially with severe burn injuries. She da real MVP[this is her now.](http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/famous/scarlett.html)And all they'll do is grow up, and knock her keys, glasses and wallet of the table.This reminded me a great short story:

Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we say, love. 

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye, and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot has appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" 

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. 

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. 

Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear-Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. 

Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 

He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.

When I was in sixth grade I was suspended for getting into an argument with my religion teacher. She told us animals have no feelings and don't go to heaven. So, I told her about how my cats were so sweet and a somewhat famous news story of the time (2006) about a dog that saved its owner from something, I don't remember. Anyway, even after all that, her answer was,""Well, no."" I told her,""This is why so many people don't like religion, because of nuts like you!"" I was suspended for a day.

Caring profession, not giving a shit about stereotypes. Admirable.[deleted]Those are some smoking hot nurses. He did right I would say. Nurse who happens to be male here. In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options. Often you're immediately emasculated. Females look at you as a man doing a historically woman's job which makes them wonder why you're there to begin with. Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience. Now working as a traveller and agency RN, i sometimes work in multiple hospitals a week with all new faces and people to get to know which makes you all the more intriguing to the staffers if you don't suck. I am a female RN but my youngest brother is an LPN. He says his nursing school experience was just terrible and working with 99.9% women is less than ideal for him.I'm a male and I've been an RN for about 7 months now.  Out of taking care of hundreds of patients.. only one has had a problem with a male taking care of them.  All the others had nothing but positive things to say about males being in nursing.  When I starting nursing school I used to be afraid to tell people my major due to the negative stigma.  That stigma does not exist and I am now proud to tell people I am a nurse.  Patients, doctors, and other nurses all treat me with the utmost respect.  I am not a male nurse.

I actually stayed there two years ago. There is a small hotel on the island (on the side closest to land, next to the bridge). 

Here are some pictures of the hotel : [Image 1](https://d1p98clqffzjxh.cloudfront.net/lazareto/L13405.jpg). [Image 2](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cc/0f/c7/tower-and-stone-cottage.jpg).

I ran up to the top of the island every day of our stay. There's a church up there, and a couple of lookouts, one of which can be seen in OP's picture (top of the island, closest to land).

What hasn't been mentioned here is that the island and town is pretty much uninhabited - a lot of the building have been restored for historical purposes.

Currently much of the town is closed off to the public - buildings and areas that are open have been converted to tourist shops, bars and hotels. It's a pretty cool place. Perhaps when the restorations are fully complete there will be room for more people to stay in the town.

Without a doubt, my favourite part of Monemvasia is the little enclosed ""pool"" on the side. I couldn't find any great pictures, but here is a [pretty decent one](http://www.mediterranean-cruise-advice.com/images/IMG_0082.jpg), showing the little enclosed natural pool, which curves around and continues beyond the picture. I really enjoyed staying there.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that [in this conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2tupdd/the_hidden_town_of_monemvasia_greece/co2i6zr?context=10000), /u/woohalladoobop points out that the building OP is talking about is a city-owned home for the mayor to live in, and claims that he lived there. I'm calling out his bullshit.

The full comment, as it has since been deleted:
> I actually come from Monemvasia. That house is owned by the city for the mayor to live in. Fun fact: Mayor Spiros Anagna was thrown out of a window over the cliff by some townsfolk in the 1920's after he was caught having an affair with an underage girl who worked at the house.

The house isn't a house, it's a church, named Agia Sofia (pronounced ayia sofia). [Here is a picture](https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/38470106.jpg) of some tourists next to it (not my picture).

EDIT: [Here are some photos that I took](http://imgur.com/a/Qj7xa#0). The last picture is me, and yes, my face is a black box. That is the highest point on the island. Wasn't wearing my running gear that day, since I walked up instead with the rest of the family.

* The stairs that lead you underneath and outside the town walls, to a platform facing the open sea (The Myrtoon Pelagos (pronounced ""Mir-to-on""). People could dive in, the waters are amazing, and there are some steps to help you back up. In the summer, children would joyfully sit on the platform and let the waves wash over them. 
* The view from the center of the town square facing up towards the rock and the steps leading to the top is beautiful, brings to mind something out of a fairytale.
* There are some great coctail bars up there (it helps that I spent my summer there with great friends as well)!

**EDIT: cannot format....This town has an awesome history. For the Crusade buffs out there, when Constantinople was displaced from the Byzantine Empire after the 4th Crusade, many various Crusader kingdoms were carved out from Greece. Monemvasia held out though for the longest time as a pirate town/raiding point and proved to be a headache for the occupying Crusader kingdoms. Even when the entire Peloponnesus was under Crusader control, this one seaside enclave held out. Its amazing.**[Spanakopita!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wgR_4TwHOQ)**

Some people are asking about the local economy. It's mostly tourism. But Peloponisos, the mainland, has a lot of agriculture too. It's one of the greek places that is open for business not only for the summer, like the greek islands, but it's a perfect destination for winter travelling too.

More people live here than the countries of Canada and Iraq [Reminds me of this picture of Mexico City](http://i.imgur.com/FPO3S59.jpg)I visited Tokyo once, and one thing that stuck with me was how I've read a lot of science fiction that I thought was original, but no, it's just describing Tokyo.  Pretty much everything that's written about a giant city-like planet is really Tokyo inspired.

It definitely made me think about how there are surely some people who have never left that city in their lives, and just what you imagine the rest of the world to be like if you're one of those people.No wonder it's taken Godzilla so long to destroy it.It kind of looks like a sci-fi concept of a planet-wide city.For perspective, [this is the greater Tokyo area superimposed onto the United Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/Eqfme.jpg)See that EA? This is what Sim City should be about. Let me build (or at least plan and manage) THIS. 

What's so hard about it?  I just essentially need Sim City 3000 on today's hardware. No real 3D is even needed.I live in Tokyo... this is just one direction... If you go to to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building, Mori tower, or Tokyo Sky Tree on a clear day, you just see... cement as far as the eye can see. You'll see Kawasaki connect to Yokohama, and then it just fades into the distance. Then you'll see Chiba and Saitama (which we consider the sticks) wall-to-wall with buildings. Then you'll see all the way to Takao-san with nothing but buildings until you get right to the foot of the mountain. It's absolutely insane...

At night it is breathtaking, though.

From this it's easy to find the big landmarks. 

Shinjuku is group of skyscrapers on the left side in the middle, which is said to have the busiest subway station in the world. At the right side of the big green park you find Shibuya, you know the shopping district with the [worlds busiest street crossing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2685/4458168800_2727610646_b.jpg),  and the cluster of ""dark"" skyscrapers, guess they are just being shadowed by a cloud, is just beyond the imperial palace and gardens. 



It is in fact the only city large enough for my mother.  When I was visiting Tokyo I thought I would go out to the bar one night. I never thought about the fact that the trains might stop running at some point. So when I came out of the club at 2-3am, I realized I had to walk back to my hotel. Five hours later, after walking in a straight line, I got there. ### it's a **MEGALOPOLIS!** I think I made something like this in SimCity once. The city barely lasted a week. That traffic must be a blast to drive in I like that one green spot. Like that. That is where I shall live!Awesome shot. It always blows my mind when I see non-US cities (as an American). I think Chicago or Charlotte or LA are huge, but they don't hold a candle to the size of some foreign cities. 

EDIT: 

Been getting some responses that seem to be questioning my inclusion of Charlotte. Please note that I included it because not only do I live here and love this city but I figured size-wise it is about the same as a lot of other American cities with the exception of the big three and would make a good reference point when comparing to non-American cities. 

Here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown:

I went to Tokyo a few years back and it was absolutely amazing.  I was in Shinjuku and it was so nice and clean and beautiful.  I've been to NYC numerous times and it was so dirty, the streets were disgusting, tons of homeless people, just total noise pollution from cars hoking etc.  During my stay in Tokyo, over i think it was 4 days, I heard a total of 3 car honks.  3 Car honks in 4 days.  I can hear 3 car honks in 3 seconds in New York City.  So many international cities just outclass NYC, yet apparently NYC is a pride of our country.  Joe Biden's comments about LaGuardia airport a while back is really a microcosm of NYC as a whole, it's dirty, disgusting, and inefficient.  Tokyo's so great because it's like a nicer NYC, but far larger.  Looks like a giant computer motherboard.

Comment thread in the Dutch subreddit[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2nv3gx/you_will_not_be_arrested_for_using_drugs_in/) Avoid the classic Pulp Fiction situation. As a graphic designer, I love how practically everything in the Netherlands is professionally designed. Isn't it usually possession that's illegal, not the actual consumption?In Australia, at school and university I was always reminded that no matter what the person has ingested, legal or not; it is always safe for them to ring an ambulance. They will only ring the police if there is a dangerous and violent situation.

Paramedics are there to save your life, not to criminally charge you.Little story about some of the victims involved in this.

2 British tourists collapsed on the street after buying and using cocaine that turned out to be white heroin sold as cocaine, both got brought to a hospital. 

After they get some medication one of them decides he feels fine and bails. When the hospital staff realizes he's gone they inform the police who eventually track him down that same night, he was quite easy to spot since the first responders cut open his clothes to get to his chest and he was wearing those clothes. 

He refuses to go back to the hospital, the police have no choice but to detain him and put him in a temporary holding cell where they continuously check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know the exact details on this but he stops breathing/heart stops, the EMT starts CPR. Gets picked up by an ambulance and dies on his way to the hospital.

Meanwhile, at pretty much the exact moment the other guy stops breathing too and survives because he decided to remain in the hospital.

TL;DR: 2 tourists use white heroin thinking it was cocaine, one of them dies after leaving the hospital and the other lives.That's a PSA you will never find in the USA. Where in the world do you get arrested after going to the hospital for an OD?The red-light district in Amsterdam has some pretty dodgy characters. I found the tip is to never stop moving, do not even acknowledge the existence of people trying to sell you things and above all do not show how stoned/drunk you are. What are the three red X's in the upper left corner of the notice? A way of indicating urgency?Which shoulder muscle?Smartest public health sign I have seen in a long time.  Many people will read this because of the ""Cocaine Alert"" and most of those aren't planning on buying cocaine.  But, they will remember it if they see someone with those symptoms and know what to do.  Right on and keep it up!And these huge signs help also

It's quite comical sometimes how dealers approach you so openly around the common bar areas like Rembrandtplein.Its amazing to see that they actually care and not just let drug users die.Here is a little story from personal experience if you feel like reading something. I currently work in the caregiver field for developmentally disabled adults. Upon starting the job, you find out that the mental illnesses you're dealing with are really just the extreme end of a spectrum that a lot of totally normal people with high IQs are also on. They're really not that different from us besides the fact that for a lot of conditions, their brain cannot resist the urge to do something even when it knows it's wrong. We can know better and learn and resist urges but no matter how many times I teach a client something, when the situation comes back up, the chances of them retaining the knowledge are unfortunately pretty low (but not impossible). With that being said, the following story is about someone with dev. disabilities, but the reactions their brain are having to the events in the story are totally normal and something that we all experience.

You quickly realize that the #1 trick to stopping acts of defiance in your client is to not give them something to defy.

For example we have one girl with oppositional defiance disorder. There is a set time for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, snack in that order. She constantly will cause a scene or have a documented behavior because she wants food at the times that aren't set for food.

Now she is an adult, and she should be allowed to have food any time, but we realized that it wasn't even about eating, it was that she HAD to break the rules. There was something about a rule for her that caused her to want nothing more than to overcome it and break the rule. It has a lot more to do with wanting personal control over your own life, but we call it the forbidden fruit effect.

So we solved her issue by taking away all snack times, dinner times, lunch times, breakfast times, and letting her tell us when she wanted to eat. When she wanted a 3rd or 4th snack we gave it to her. We weighed her after a week and she had gained 10 pounds in literally 1 week.

She was very upset and we explained to her the natural consequences of eating too much. We taught her how to eat healthy and feel healthy. We told her she can still eat whatever whenever she wants.

""No I want to eat healthy, I don't want to be fat.""

From then on she asks for one snack or no snack after dinner. She doesn't go crazy anymore trying to get food at times that she isn't supposed to have it because we totally took away the whole matrix of scheduled times and calories and all that stuff. We took away all of the rules to break and replaced it total freedom coupled with personal accountability.

I really believe a lot of the things people do, especially teenagers, are done 10x more because you're told not to do them. No one wants to be told by another human being with just as many flaws and shortcomings as them that they're not responsible enough to handle their own shit around some food or a drug or whatever else it is that's being forbidden.

**TL;DR A recount from an experience I had working with those with developmental disabilities that relates to the whole idea of the forbidden fruit effect. We took a girl with oppositional defiance disorder who consistently wanted to defy all the house rules and removed every rule and let her control her own life, but showed her the natural results of eating too much or not being responsible. She learned that being in control means it's on her and no one else to make the right choices, and she started making them.**[Gotta love Hamsterdam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHkrZECnfs)at night there is a LOT of coke dealers in the streets of amsterdam, most of them African (as in, actually recently from africa) ","{'Openness': 0.261, 'Analytical': 0.723, 'Sadness': 0.059729, 'Anger': 0.941726, 'Extraversion': 0.761, 'Joy': 0.057378, 'Agreeableness': 0.681, 'Emotional_Range': 0.795, 'Tentative': 0.112, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.117224, 'Fear': 0.961212, 'Conscientiousness': 0.079}",{'sign': 0.377541}

She quit in June when she found out the district director wasn't interviewing the people she found to replace the people she was missing and wasn't doing anything to help her. Fuck Wet Seal.

EDIT 5: And international news: http://www.businessinsider.com/wet-seal-workers-leave-a-sign-2015-1My dad calls this store Moist Walrus.I love the Internet because 20 years ago companies could do shit like this without any consequences. Today, there's at least a chance the company will have to address this in order to avoid the negative publicity and backlash if the story gets out long term employee's without raises is extremely common unfortunately. I still work part time in retail, but only because I have been there since before a pay freeze. A lot of very hard workers trying to get by for $8 an hourWet Seal Dayton Mall, saw this yesterday

Looking at yahoo finance, their stock price has been below $1 since September, meaning they will be delisted from the NASDAQ soon. Heading for a bankruptcy very soon.  
[Fly you fools](http://i.imgur.com/zCZLR1n.jpg)I work in one of the Wet Seal stores this is happening in and it's awful! Our sick time is not ""given"" to use, we have to accrue it like vacation days. My staff was given 24 hours notice before their last shift and my assistants and myself are having to work in the store by ourselves so corporate can avoid paying out extra money to associates. I also have an associate in my store who has been with me for over a month, her pay card was not activated by corporate and when we called about it we find out the lady in charge of that department had taken a vacation and literally tons of other girls were not receiving money on their pay cards either. This whole situation is crappy for all people on the bottom of the totem pole and I'm honestly just glad to be done with this company. Same story here in [North Carolina](http://imgur.com/j8b4jHn).  I know a store manager over there who has been told nothing but lies over the last month when questioning why their store wasn't receiving new inventory.  Classy company.  That's pretty fucked up. Not getting paid for your sick leave is par for the course... Most retail employees don't even get paid sick days. A $95,000 raise for the CEO is legitimately undetectable in terms of corporate cash flow. That being said, giving your employees one day to find a new job is absolutely awful. My girlfriend was a manager at Borders, the book store, when before they went bankrupt. The employees were strung along for quite some time, but eventually they came clean and said ""we're closing in 3 weeks, liquidate everything"". Most of the employees stayed during that time because it was pretty much the easiest retail job they could ever have for 3 weeks. ""What're they gonna do, fire me?""My partner works for H&M. He's a 5 year employee. He now has 5 weeks vacation, 14 days 'personal' time and healthcare for both of us (domestic partner insurance) that costs less that $50/month with a tiny deductible. I've worked for Apple, Samsung and Canon. I've never had benefits as good as he gets. 

Just chiming in to say retailers can do right by their people. as a stocky 30 year old male, I will be sure to never shop there again.From someone who is ignorant, why are so many Wet Seal stores closing?
Good for them. I have no idea what Wet Seal is but good for them. A month with no check, commendation to the person who didn't burn that building to the ground.Shitty ass corporations man. I worked at a pizza hut a few years back and they told us the store was going to eventually close, but never gave us a date. So I stroll into work one day and find the store locked, and closed signs all over it. Not even a call. Good riddance. 

I hope those poor employees find something else. A place where they aren't so much screwed over. They are lucky all the employees did is make a sign, and not just take turns shitting on the floor before walking outMy company's CEO got a $3mil raise last year while we were in financial hardship.Going to be a tough week for Wet Seal's social media team...if they even have jobs anymore.","{'Openness': 0.274, 'Analytical': 0.067, 'Sadness': 0.055768, 'Anger': 0.968337, 'Extraversion': 0.455, 'Joy': 0.061465, 'Agreeableness': 0.591, 'Emotional_Range': 0.777, 'Tentative': 0.215, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.084177, 'Fear': 0.037523, 'Conscientiousness': 0.204}",{}

You can even see little bits of brown around the photo that were left to make it seem unedited but seem oddly out of place. Examples are the headless statue and surrounding area, materiel hanging out the window, little spot of brown on the far right down slope.

A few questions,

-What are people supposed to do when you live this close to an active volcano? 

-Does the media play a positive or negative part when something like this happens?

-Can lava melt steel beams?Anyone want a quick volcanology lesson? Heres how this type of eruption works. Inside the mountain is a magma chamber, filled with liquid magma under pressure. In this magma are gasses dissolved inside it. Think of it like a bottle of soda, when you look at the liquid, it's just liquid; but when you release the pressure, the gasses come out and bubble up out the liquid. Same principle in this type of volcano. When the pressure gets too high in the chamber an eruption begins and the gasses in the magma are released out of the magma just like in the soda bottle. But the gasses also bring with it some magma that is quickly solidified into particles as the gas escapes, this is the volcanic ash. So the huge cloud you see is a combination of volcanic gasses and particulate magma known as ash, and at very high temperatures non the less. As the pressure in the magma chamber comes down the eruption slows down, and when the pressure has been relieved the eruption ends. Not a volcanologist, so this info is my synthesis of a complicated process from when I wanted to learn how this worked one day, and is a very basic explanation. [here is a time lapse Video of the erupting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljrDn3Gel4M)[deleted]Calbuco is the name of the volcano.

Also, more info on [Lichtenberg figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure)! This may sound obvious, but if you see something like that happening, don't go near it. There's other people in this thread who said that, but I'm not sure if everyone knows the reason why. It's not just because the person telling you to stay away thinks you're stupid and going to accidentally touch the line. Being near the line can kill you, you don't have to actually touch the line to die. 

An energized wire on the ground causes something called ""step potential"". Basically, the voltage in the ground is high near the wire, and decreases the farther away from the wire you get. If your feet are apart, the voltage between your feet can cause a current to travel through your body. Maybe it'll injure you, maybe it'll kill you. If you need to get away from something like this, shuffle away with your feet together. They used to tell us you could also hop with your feet together, but I guess they don't trust us not fall over, because that would also probably kill you. 

tl;dr: Just being near a burning wire like this can kill you, even without actually touching it.[Who wants a body massage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3GTNv9hHk)It's the Sha from WoW! Except real!I have had the experience of watching a high voltage line fall to the ground and arc several times after a rain storm. I was about 200' away when it fell. The sound, heat, and brilliant light was truly a thing to behold. The sound is a tortured and macabre screed in the most evil tone you've ever heard. The heat and light are incredibly intense. Unfortunately the sound drew my eyes directly to the fireball and it left an after image the persisted for several minutes. 

These underground vault fires are something special too. I have watched an attempt to put these out before. As I recall, it took this massive truck pumping insane quantities of CO2 into the vault to chill it before anyone could enter. 

http://youtu.be/0_jLmAB3leAReal Question: Shouldn't this wire be insulated?ShockingFractals. Crazy how they pop up over and over.Lineman here, can confirm, stay away. People,  voltage won't kill you, amperage will. The resistance of the ground changes everywhere, that's the reason for the lighting bolt pattern. What's cool is that along where the wire was on the ground (directly beneath the wire) it'll make crude glass, which looks pretty bad ass. 
Safety: NEVER touch a down wire. We are protected by step/touch potential by rubber over shoes gloves and sleeves, even then we still verify that the wire is de-energized before we touch it. Keep in mind de-energized does not mean that it's safe to touch. Had a worker bump a line with his leg that was down and de-energized but not properly grounded, didn't have his boots on because they were In a marsh and he got killed. Induced voltage from another line. If a wire is on the ground think of it as a bear or wolf, you get to close and it's going to maim and more often than not kill you... 

TL/DR: Never touch a wire on the ground, fear that shit like it's got a gun to your head. That's fracted up.Sha-touched groundA similar pattern grew on a CD I left in my car for over a year:

The City of Boston claims a 60% reduction in power consumption and full replacement paying of in just 2-3 years.  Fantastic program.The light pollution effect is *very* evident in this picture.  Notice the foliage between the lamps on either side--the traditional lighting shows an orange bleed for the entire area, yet the trees between the LED lamps are almost completely unilluminated.Those orange lights sure are going to be nostalgic in 20 years...Which city is this?From this angle, the LED lamp posts look to be more efficiently directing the light. Compared to the conventional post which appears to be shining light everywhere with limited efficiency. Unless there is a great deal of reflection of light from the pavement, I'd say that light pollution is less likely. The way I understand it, LED's are more directional that conventional light bulbs. But that's only my opinion.LED looks much more natural. I hate the orange street lights. Always have. Wish this was happening on my street!/r/darksky would like this.depends on the white balance on your camera tooThey started this in my city, and I'm actually not a fan of it.

I travel on a highway to work almost every day. The lamp posts are more spaced apart and much higher up than in this picture, so the light is less concentrated and the dark spots you see in this photo are much larger. 

The orange street lights spread the light out better and didn't leave dark patches like the LED's did. The LED's are worse during the winter as well because they are much dimmer in my city than in this picture. The orange lights help distinguish definition on the road much better, but with the LED street lights, its harder to tell where icy/deep snow patches might be.

These would be a great for city driving where the posts are usually shorter and closer together and would illuminate the street as well as it does in this picture, but for highway and winter driving, the orange is better.

But that's just my opinionI, personally, prefer warmer colored lights.They did this to my street sometime around 3 weeks ago. It only really decreases light pollution above lamp level. You know, reduces the pink sky effect. 

The HUGE downside is that the inside of my house looks like daytime now. And the light is blue. Blue = bad at night (thanks f.lux). 

I used to be able to sleep with my curtains open. White curtains. I hadn't slept well in a week, and had one of those aha moments when you're lying in bed at 2am, curtains closed, looking at the ceiling and thinking holy crap its bright blue in here, with the curtains closed, its bright as hell. 

Replaced my white curtains with red ones to mute out the blue, and now I'm fine. Then I think, how many people will lose sleep like me, and not realize the issue, and then wake up and screw my commute by driving tired and getting into accidents. 


And also, why couldn't the get a warmer colour temp for the LED's? Blue sucks, at least give me yellow or something. These new lights have been attracting the gypsy moths back

Wanna put shout out to r/invasivespecies for the info!I have no source for this, just something that I heard, but apparently there is some question over the long term health effects that replacing the sodium lamps will have. The white LEDs simulate sunlight, whereas the sodium lamps are more similar to candlelight in terms of coloring. I guess there is some discussion over whether or not this shift will disrupt the natural sleep cycles of people walking around at night, or even having this light shining in through their windows. 

On a small scale, the shift is not expected to be bad, but if they were to replace every street lamp, apparently there might be some problems. 

Anyone care to verify or dispute these claims? Idk if OP knows but the LED lamps probably look better in this picture because of the white balance setting on the camera that captured this shot. Maybe I'm nitpicking though.Chicago resident here... They have been slowly replacing the old street lights the the new LED bulbs over the past few years in our glorious city. They got to our street last fall and once the polar vortex struck with its powerful might we noticed the streets were dark at night. The new bulbs couldn't melt the snow and ice off the lamps like they use to!! They actually had crew go around and knock the buildup off. Thanks Obama!Replacing sodium vapor lamps with white LEDs as street lights is a good plan, but not a great one.  I think that replacing them with red or orange LEDs would have been a much better idea, since you still need your night vision once you leave that road that looks like it's lit by the sun.I hate the cold white of the LED street lamps... I liked my warm orange glow =(It's worth noting the Hwite balance of the photo is set to the temperature of the LED lights so it makes the Tungsten lights look like shit; not a really fair photography.

[A photograph I took for Instance](http://i.imgur.com/u5JREM5.jpg), the camera White Balance was set for the Tungsten lights up front, the halogen around the side as a result turned a a very noticeable Green color in the photography; with the naked eye the lights looked the same.I wish they'd tint them orange. It's easier on the eyes for night driving I thought. (Other than that the old ones were naturally reddish).That tall building in the background has a faceThe building almost directly centre looks so happy.Random note - the yellow/orange lights actually produce more lumens (more light) per bulb, but due to the light being more omni-directional and having a bad color-rendering index, to humans the LEDs appear like a much better light. This looked so Korean, so I zoomed in and found that it was Korea.LEDs are a complicated issue. They save energy but the cheapest kind emit blue-rich light which simulate the daylight which can be harmful to humans and animals alike. The rule to remember is to use red light at night. Just the other day, LEDs received a Nobel Prize. You can read about how that might affect dark skies and light pollution [here](http://darksky.org/night-sky-conservation/421).

Dear God, these guys were awesome, they will be thoroughly missed.never give up!

humor is immortal!

http://i.imgur.com/xeoCHEM.jpgThat's terrible.
I'm french and I'm so sad.
The signification of this attack is very strong. They wounded freedom.
Four cartoonists, they killed an economist too, Bernard Maris, I listened him on national radio ""France Inter"" on the morning.
RIPThe sad thing is that many have hoped media around the world would publish the cartoons that led to this tragedy. But what has actually happened is media blurring the cartoons in fear. Example from the Telegraph in the UK: http://i.imgur.com/lwcqqrY.png

Edit: Full context on the page: http://i.imgur.com/eYKGcaw.pngThe cartoonists are Cabu and Charb, but other people have been killed too, including cartoonists Wolinski and Tignous.

Here are some of their work:

[Cabu](http://a54.idata.over-blog.com/3/88/02/15/2010-101112/charlie_hebdo_c_est_dur_d_etre_aime_par_des_cons_cabu.jpg) - Translation: *Mahomet overwhelmed by integrists* ; ""It's tough, being loved by such cunts""

[Charb](http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2015/01/07/1714196-b6v30sgcuaai-ol.jpg) - Translation: *No terrorist attacks in France so far* ; ""Wait! We have 'til the end of January to present our wishes/resolutions...""

[Wolinski](http://a404.idata.over-blog.com/500x479/2/31/51/01/758/Wolinski.gif) - Translation: the sign reads *Attack claimed by far-right extremists* ; Policemen: ""Walk slower, or we'll have no choice but to arrest them!"" ; Perpetrators: ""Walk faster, or they'll have no choice but to arrest us!""  
NOTE: Wolinski did very few policital drawings compared to his peers and was mostly known for his drawings on sexual perversion. I selected this drawing because a) it's the only political one I could find and b) it's one of the few that aren't NSFW.

[Tignous](http://marcsuivre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/caricature-tignous-islam1.jpg) - Translation: Man: ""You ought to cover yourself!"" ; Woman: ""Do you want it in the gabber, my Hand of Fatima?""[this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Wolinski) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignous) also, apparently. RIPThey apparently yelled that they were avenging Mohammed. What kind of god or prophet needs vengeance from a comic? These attacks don't show people's strength of conviction, they show the weakness of their beliefs. No one has ever strapped a bomb to their chest because of their belief in quantum mechanics or group theory.Between the majority of media's decision not to show these artists' works uncensored, and Sony caving to North Korea's (partially successful) attempt to prevent the release of The Interview, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the way our culture has caved to the violent, threatening tactics of fanaticism. Free-thinking nations should not be shriveling up like this in the face of hatred and oppression of thought. What a shameful time we live in.Jesus fucking christ, it's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated.

Some of you mentioned that you shouldn't do something that will offend all Muslims. I disagree. No group and no person should be above satire. Side note: A connect-the-dots of ""TPM"" would be fun if it was directed at the proper websites. You know, I'm extremely liberal when it comes to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and open immigration, but even I think it's time for Europe to tell Muslim immigrants to assimilate or expatriate. You want to wear hijabs and preach in the street? Fine. Want to convert old, unused churches to mosques? Groovy, awesome way to preserve architecture. Want to offer Middle East studies and Arabic in schools? Capital idea! Want to hold open iftars? Save a slice of baklava for me.

Cabu (left) was an household name in France. Such a sweet, intelligent, strong guy. Participated in the children broadcasts we were all watching in the 80s.

http://i.imgur.com/B3FUlc2.png...Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, Bosun's Mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.Practically all people on the ship are black, practically all people in the water are white.

I had a Barred Rock (aka Plymouth Rock) hen as a pet named ""Puffer"" when I was younger, she would follow me EVERYWHERE and would even go sledding with me, ride around on my shoulder, hang out with the family, etc.  Coolest chicken ever.

Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but when these issues crop up I always seem to think that they are deliberate to distract from some other policy they are pushing through. Think about it. You want to push through a controversial policy limiting freedoms? Simply announce that you are ""proposing internet tax."" Cause protests, all news focuses on that. Your policy/law change gets through without resistance from the country. You announce you will not tax internet. The people feel happy and are none the wiser.You don't restrict the opiate to the masses, they'll come for your asses.I would die if there was an internet tax. Like in Democracy 3, I saw a tax for the internet to make millions, I know it's a game, and even though I'm 2k billion in debt, I'll never pass an internet tax.I love when people post pictures like this. It always put it in perspective to me on how big it is.With everything going on about this, and looking at this picture, all I see is that it looks like their connection has been throttled.

She said that no one ever climbed Mount Fuji because Dragon ate them.
She also had a glass eye and  lazy I on the other side and swore that the Kane from WWE was her uncle.

NeatIce.... Cave... under a Volcano?... sounds like a death trap.This reminded me there was some pseudo-scence attempt in some website somewhere to explain how dragons would be and they were apparently made of carbon fiber that would allow them to have hollow bones like birds, so they'd be light without losing durability to allow flying. They'd have a sack of methane or some gas in their stomach which they would spark with a specialized lighter-like organ in their throat that would allow it to breathe fire.

They'll just think it's some lame souvenir shop pendant.I can't even comprehend how the artist was able to do this so perfectly. Really cool piece of art.[deleted]SO DARK THE CON OF MAN

http://i.imgur.com/SHUEeBq.jpg""each slice sold for $5000? Jesus, it's just glass! Slap an art tag on a pile of shit and I could sell it I bet!""

*opens link*

""oh.. Yeah, 5k sounds fair.""Every time I read a description about an art form I always think- ""cool something for me to try""
I have to pretend I never saw this nowProfessional glass artist here. This is how it's made:

The artist will pull very long strands of glass in all the colors that required for the picture he wants to make. They then arrange the long strands of glass into say a face or a foot or something. then melt them all together and pull that very long again. Then you can take the face you made and add that 'face' strand to a whole bunch of other strands to make an overall picture.

tldr: it's just like using one pixel at a time to make up the whole image.[deleted]Yeah yeah yeah that's real neat and all but you can't even smoke weed out of it.  Fantastic stuff! I love this.Cut it thinIs there a discount for the end piece?how do they slice this?Calling these things slices makes me want to eat one.If you're interested in glass art, there are two really good subreddits for it. /r/glassheads and /r/lampwork are both full of amazing glass art, artisits, and a copious amount of knowledgeable people in the art.In the future, the one who can collect all the pieces and join them together will be granted a wish.

Interesting.Note to self: find a desert map for Cities Skyline.Those look to be the upper middle class suburbs, they tend to be on the outskirts of Vegas away from the strip since they overlook the desert mountains. High schools get built onto empty dirt lots and homes surround the area. Unfortunately, most of these homes get built around the outer edges more and more each year with less and less people buying them out. I'm only 23 and most of my friends have been able to *buy* these homes at this age from how cheap they are. I'm a Vegas Native and I can safely say this is only a specific view of suburban Vegas life. I'd even say Vegas has many different kinds of suburban looks since the city keeps growing immensely every year.

*edit from mobile* so thanks to savvy Vegas friends below this has been identified as the Aliante portion of Vegas, which is definitely a way nicer suburb of Vegas. I didn't meant to imply that these homes are foreclosing, but lots of neighborhoods that look like this one nearby are affordable to younger folks like me. Looks like future mars.Nuketown[deleted]Made of ticky tacky.Question for those that have lived in Vegas.

 In my many trips to Vegas I've noticed that most of the neighborhoods have brick walls built around them, why is that?Reminds me of ""The Goldfinch"".  [deleted]Lots of comments from people saying Vegas sucks. I've been out here 10 years. It's fine. Every city sucks if you're looking for reasons for it to. It's just like any other place. Many of the complaints apply to any major city. Drivers suck, drug problems, crime, people are ""fake"" blah blah blah. I don't drink, do drugs, party, etc anymore. I have a decent career and life out here in this ""party town"". It's all about how you look at it. I think the desert is beautiful. Yeah, it gets hot as hell. It's a desert. We also don't have to shovel snow. This winter was cold for like a week in late December. Other than that, nothing more than a light jacket was ever needed. 

All of that being said, don't raise kids here unless you can put them in private school. Clark County schools are atrocious. Even if they graduate high school (~30% won't), the curriculum is so weak that they will still be at a disadvantage. Especially in an out of state university.

I have desert landscaping. Grass is dumb in the desert. Even outside of being a waste of water and contributing to the humidity, it just doesn't look right in the middle of the desert. I sure as shit don't want to be outside cutting the grass when it's 115 degrees out.This looks exactly like the homes in Las Ventura's in San Andreas in GTA: San Andreas.I live there. AMAI live in a similar neighborhood on the south west end of Las Vegas.  It's kind of nice and weird knowing that across the street there is literally nothing but desert for hundreds of miles.https://www.google.com/maps/@36.3090064,-115.1967351,1475m/data=!3m1!1e3

Location on map.fuck i belong in vegas. I'm a dirt bike freak, trails are hard to come by in Toronto, Canada... Ah, this picture reeks of corporate interests and government unwillingness to stand up against the corporations. Notice how the colour of the area outside the suburbs is faded, signifying the death throes of Mother Nature herself. The grey, uniform tops of the houses signify the victory of the corporate agenda and the defeat of the common person, who is now powerless to stop the overreach of the 1%.Looks just like my sim city. If you've got a good set of illegal binoculars, you can even see those dastardly fools over in Desert Bluffs.This is right next to Shadow Ridge High School. I bought my car from a guy near here.Reddit is weird. Space colonies are the future but trying to live in the desert is arrogant and unsustainable.Ahh a good case study for gridding in Cities Skyline.Honestly this does not look so bad.

I would rather grow up there than my own city.

Imagine being an 8-14 year old kid there with a giant desert behind your house to explore, build bike trails, jumps and just wander.

also there is an airport near on the bottom left corner to watch planes land and take off.

Then at 16 with a summer job and saving up allowances I'd get a small dirtbike to tour around in the desert.

Seriously, this place looks 10x better than growing up in other cities where you are locked in on 4 sides with shitty bylaws setup by old women city councilors.

Legit question: 

How does lightning strike from a volcano cloud? I've only ever seen lightning in the clouds from the sky, before, so this is a new concept to me. How am I supposed to get all the way up there with just this stupid ring and my stupid midget buddies?

""Who disturbs my slumber?""Shit like this is why ancient civilizations believed in cool gods.OMG I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

Okay, fun fact about Venus, the atmosphere is to thick and hot for rain, so when it rains sulfuric acid on venus it evaporates a few km above the surface.

But there is lightning? Lightning on earth comes with rainstorms, but the lack of rainstorms on venus means that the lightning  comes from the volcanic ash buildup in the atmosphere.This is WILD. High quality pics post right here. Quetzalcoatl returnsHolly shit!!! I never thought I'd see something from my hometown on reddit. I use to live less than 10 miles from this volcano.

Somehow that line really struck a chord with me. You never know how much you have until you almost lose it all. ITT: People expect a random bystander to cut this guy out somehow. What else can a person do other than take a pic and wait for the proper authorities? Science is awesome. Crumple Zones for the win!

http://cdn5.movieclips.com/paramount/t/top-secret-1984/0549550_15137_MC_Tx360.jpgMy prediction is someone will photoshop an angel standing in front with it's arms out pushing each semi to save him. It will be reposted to facebook next week and my mom will show it to me next month. Can anyone figure out how he got in that position? Perpendicular to two parallel semis? As a former firefighter I have seen people live through much worse. I don't have pictures to prove it but it is weird how some people can survive crazy shit. The majority of them where not in great shape but they did live.

The one that I remember most though is a drunk that hit a mini-van head on. This was back in 1989 and the guys head punched through the windshield. The Sgt. went to support his neck and his fingers slid inside his throat. Took us all back for a few seconds and then we went back to the rescue.

Once we removed the dash both of his legs where facing towards his torso and through all this, he was breathing. Not with it, but alive.

He survived though.Like a good neighbor, state farm is therrreee..... with a hacksawhttp://i.imgur.com/ds7nimr.gifvDoes anyone else find it unsettling that there is a skull like face embedded into the crumpled frame just to the right of his face?!So this is actually my cousin, just got off the phone with him. He was coming back from a business trip in Oregon (he's a farmer in Washington) when this happened. According to him there semis in front of him hit black ice, and he then slid into them, crushing him like this. His airbag didn't go off (luckily) and he said he had about 1 ft. of room to move around in. He was able to get out of the car after about 30 minutes. Although he says he only has a couple cuts and a bruise near his eye, he did go to the hospital where he was checked out and everything was fine. He's now happy to be home with his son and pregnant wife.

Cherry blossoms guide your way,

I expected something else[Source](https://500px.com/photo/105244145/fuji!-by-daniel-kordan) and /r/japanpics if you want to take a look.For anyone feeling inspired to go to Japan, I've gone twice so let me make it concrete for ya.

**Flights:** Flights can be, at best, around 600 USD round trip. United ran a special for this cost. Often you'll find a round trip for about 1200 USD (this is my experience flying from SFO in the bay area). Use [itasoftware](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) to search for flights. Also google around for deals.

Alternatively, look into acquiring mileage points through credit card usage and flying for free. 

**Room:** On my second visit I stayed in a hostel called [Khaosan Kabuki](http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/en/kabuki/) for about 35 a night. You can get free room if you volunteer to clean. 

Many hostels are similarly priced / have similar volunteer benefits. 

Let me clarify that a ""hostel"" is not as shady as it connotes. The place I stayed was as clean as any hotel I've been to.

Capsule Hotels are also cheap and somewhat of an experience. 

**Food:** Food in Japan is like food anywhere. There's cheap stuff (less than 10) decent stuff (10-25) and expensive (30-100's). 

You can have a very enjoyable trip eating for less than 10 a meal although I suggest splurging once or twice because Japan does have amazing food to offer. The best value / quality for sushi I've heard of and had myself is a place called [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/index.html).

There's no tipping either which is amazing as I'm from the U.S. and any $10 meal was actually $10.

**Sights / Activities:** This is far more flexible depending on the kind of person you are. I spent most of my time walking around which is free.  I recommend at least 1 planned activity that's unique to Japan and new to you (Karaoke, Onsen, traditional breakfast, etc). 

**Language Barrier:** Japanese people are some of the most courteous and kind people in the world. Culture reasons. One of the things that stands out on my first trip was a mob of people *standing on the right side of an escalator and letting walkers through on the left. No one broke this rule.* 

English is pretty prevalent in Japan, especially the cities. In fact there's a Starbucks in the Shibuya Crossing which is a hugely popular spot and a KFC nearby. Western influence abounds.

People are mostly happy to try and communicate with you. But yes, it's scary to engage with someone who doesn't speak your language. 

**Story Time:** I was with my friend Matt (who had actually just finished traveling east from Florida... long way around the world). We had a ""sushi day"" where we decided to get expensive sushi lunch and dinner in the same day.

For lunch, we visited [Kyubei](http://www.kyubey.jp/). Our reservation was made by our Hostel staff (which is something they are always willing to help with). I'm assuming they acknowledged we were English speaking and we were sat with a chef who spoke enough English. 

For dinner, we visited the [highest-rated sushi place on Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066854-d1692134-Reviews-Sushiryori_Inose-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html). After an awesome sushi course, we were sitting alone in their shop. It was cold outside. The sushi chef spoke ""O-sake?"" offering us some sake. 

Well, we ended up sitting with them for almost two more hours drinking sake and bumbling our way through communication. I learned their son is a model in magazines. They pulled out a giant map of the world and my friend Matt showed them where he had been. They like California Cabernet wine. The wife played some Michael Jackson on her phone and did an impersonation. 

Points here are that people want to connect with you and Japan is pretty accepting of English.

We even had a bus driver yelling at us on a bus full of Japanese passengers. Turns out we missed our stop (I had mentioned it to him before getting on). He literally stopped the bus, motioned for us to get out, and pointed us in the right direction. It was embarrassing and stressful unlike the previous sushi dinners. Point here is that there will be moments where it's not roses.

---

All in all you could do Japan on 2k easily. If you pull a flight deal or a free flight through miles it'll be even cheaper.Ok, I will be that guy.

WTF is going on with the ladder. 

It looks like somebody was fixing the roof and just said. ""Fuck it, I will just leave this here.""Where was this taken?  gTA needs a game set in Japan.I miss japan.

That is one large pack of menthol cigarets. A random $2 book that has been sitting unsold for a decade and they wanted to get rid of.Every hospital should have one of these.WHERE is this??I'm sure it's filled with stale inventory, unfortunately.If it was well curated, this could be fun.  Poorly curated, it would be lame. I had a roommate/cousin who would always buy random books in bulk and fill our house with them. He'd get somewhere around 10 for $1 and had this idea that he could sell them for money. I am now ashamed to say that up until this day I thought  it was the dumbest Idea I'd ever heard. The books weren't anything special but if you market it well enough, you can come up the product we have here in front of us. I'm sorry James.It's like a slot machine where you always win :)As others have said, this is in a store in Toronto, Monkey Paw

It's a cool concept until you realize you're putting $2 in the machine to come up with a book that is literally so bad that no one would ever buy it off the shelves

The perception is that you get some unique piece of literature that you can cozy up with for a couple hours on a cold night, giving you a smile as you read about something that makes you feel worldly

The reality is that you end up with an obscure economics textbook from uganda written by some grad student that doesn't know what he's talking about, in which case you just throw it in the trashWhat a novel idea!With my luck id get something I already read, and I've read maybe 3 bookslooks like a pack of newports.If you want to see it in action: http://vimeo.com/53679084

Well superflocks of blackbirds and grackles and such form for a variety of reasons; safety in numbers helps to confuse predators, larger groups gives more eyes to lookout for danger and the dilution effect reduces the chances of the individual being eaten, a selfish herder hopes one of his bro's gets eaten instead.

In hard times it also helps increase foraging efficiency, it seems like a bigger group has a better chance of coming across a food source than a smaller group. 

These general grouping advantages work across taxa, works for schools of fish too!It's Unidan's second comingStrange, the crows migration pattern is nowhere near this location. It's as though they were summoned to gather here... but why?

Just give me a six-pack and a baseball bat and I could entertain myself for hours smashing the ice.These remind me of the glass blocks in MinecraftIDK if ""driven through a fence"" is an accurate description. Moisture laden wind was blowing through the fence depositing ice on the cold metal (and later cold ice) surfaces. This is similar to freezing rain during high winds, but it's probably more likely the result of a mist or fog coupled with wind instead of rain.

""Ice driven through a fence"" sounds to me like there was ice buildup on one side of the fence, then high winds for a time period, and the ice was forced through the fence.England: the Land of Wind and Moisture.

LIZARDPEOPLE CONFIRMED. I see a little silhouetto of a manNOT illegal. Defacement of currency laws apply to paper money. Regarding coins, a fraudulent intent is required. The use of coins to make souvenirs (pressed pennies for example,) or artwork such as this is not fraudulent, and is legal. See 18 USC Sections 331 and 475.

You can do whatever you want with money in your possession (because it is legally *your* property until you spend it), as long as the intent is not to defraud. In other words, as long as you're not doing something like clipping corners off $100 bills and gluing them to $1 bills to rip off a store, printing counterfeit currency, etc. you can basically do as you please with your own money.

The idea that ""defacing"" money for artistic purposes (or just because you're bored) is a felony or somehow illegal, is an urban legend. Note that this is for the USA, other countries have their own laws.

The wood on the handle looks better than the deck on my house that was built in '92.Very sexy. Please post to /r/ArtefactPorn What the fuck were people doing up here in the north >5000 years ago!? Nowadays we've got electric lights/heating, easily available calories and alcohol and it's still a dark cold depressing hellhole half of the year. Go back south ancestors, you're drunk.Also discovered nearby, a blue and white checkered piece of paper Someone, centuries ago, held this instrument in their hands and used it. Pretty crazy to think about!That's a long way for man to have reached so shortly after creation. Unless of course Satan put it there to test us. 

Edit:  Wow! Thank you for the gold!  Looks like they buried the hatchet. Wow an axe as old as earth.Source?How is the head fixed to the shaft?  Is there anything holding it in? I can't tell from this angle.

Edit: I'm dumb, the front is bigger than the hole.Sure, I'll just bludgeon these logs into firewood. The technical term for an axe handle is haft, not shaft.  While shaft can be applied loosely, it's like calling a joist a piece of wood.  

/Jackdaw, Crow, yadda yaddaDanes: quality axes since 2500BCI'm unfamiliar with archaeology but can someone please explain to me why this wouldn't have decomposed over the given amount of time? Soil type? Moisture? The condition of the wooden handle has me curious That's actually pretty damn fine looking axe. Didn't even realize they looked that sophisticated even after being underground for over 5000 years.Anyone know what kind of wood the haft is made of?The other half of the handle shaft looks freshly snapped. Someone screw up unearthing it?What blows the mind, for me, is that 5500 years ago, someone---a  real human--made that.  Then, they died leaving it behind.  Now, literally 5.5 millennia later, other humans find it.  There's a clear linkage, in the form of that axe, between they that found it and they that made it.TIL the Stone Age was only 5500 years ago. I seriously thought it was like a million years ago. I really need to read up on prehistory.Wow ! Axe is impressive but an intact wood shaft that is 5500 years old?? Priceless!This appears to be a nephrite (jade) ax head, it could also be chalcedony (jasper, agate).  Either stone type would be shaped by grinding, rather than chipping and flaking like flint would be.

Jade is a fairly soft stone, it seems like an odd choice for an ax.  But jade is *incredibly* resistant to breakage.  A fresh flint blade is as sharp as a surgeon's scalpel, but a single strike onto a tree trunk would dull it, and it could shatter completely.  Jade won't take an edge like flint, but it is easy to hone the edge on a bit of sandstone, and it won't break. This resistance to breakage, and ease of grinding, is one of the reasons that jade can be carved into such intricate shapes without shattering. Looks like something out of The Flintstones.Looks like they found it when someone broke off the handle.

Was it from this guy?Oh no, I arrived here too late! A college friend of my dad's would always hold the ""P.O.O.P"" awards, a challenge to see what unpackaged items people could send through the USPS.(I can't remember what the acronym was for) He also enjoyed the challenge,  We would receive on the regular fully inflated beach balls, rubber ducks, whoopie cushions, anything and everything. He held a big one one year for his birthday, and the stakes were high. One person sent him a toilet seat. My Dad won with a computer keyboard, the letters rearranged to say Happy Birthday.

In ancient societies black truffles that grew from the ground were often harvested and used as aphrodisiacs. Unscrupulous vendors would often pick lowly potatoes and try to pass them off as these special black truffles, which created the term ""to truffle"" or swindel someone, which survives today as ""to trifle."" Whoever sent that potato be triflin' mang. This reminds me of a story when I was working in France on a camp site. A friend of mine back in the Netherlands decided that he had to send me a grilled cheese sandwich because I didn't have a toaster in my tent. Too be honest I wasn't really expecting him to actually do it. But, sure enough, after about two weeks I got a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed in one of those bubble wrap envelopes.

First world problem solved.I went to the E.R the other day and while I was puking in the toilet it auto flushed next to my face, loud, like a fucking airplane toilet.  I was startled stood up, and backed into the paper towel dispenser that offered me a towel automatically.  I leaned on the sink laughing uncontrollably. I was a bit disappointed that the water sensor didn't go off.  I can never get those to work right though so I wasnt surprised.

P.S. kidney stones suck.My 4 year old daughter is deathly afraid of auto flush toilets. I wish I could 3D print my way out of that one.Brilliant. Should paint it silver so it looks more like part of the design. Nothing like getting used to sensor faucets everywhere you go, then feeling like an idiot when you hold your hands in front of a 'normal' faucet wondering why it's not working.Now to print something for those ridiculous sink sensor soap dispensers. Half the time the soap doesn't come out and the other half of the time the soap shoots out unexpectedly and hits you on your wrist.Fuck sensor faucets. That is all.Sensors like these operate on voltage signals, so each distance has a different voltage associated with it. Many sensors only turn on if that distance is like 4-7 inches (if I am remembering correctly). If that 3d printed knob works that sensor is really bad.Yee its cool and all, but that 3D printed part is going to become a paradise for germs.

You don't have to touch anything, they're great!My last job just had a pedal underneath the sink you stepped on to get the water going.  Cheaper and more effective than IR.Aren't they designed just so you don't have to be touching a faucet someone else touched right after using the bathroom? Like isn't it to discourage germs spreading?I once convinced someone that it wasn't a sensor, it was a camera, and there was a building full of people in China who would turn the water on and off when someone wanted to use the sink.

This is a UK Native Marine tank. I live right by the beach in Dorset so the water is collected from the sea and the animals from rock pools. I only borrow creatures to observe for a while in the tank then they go back; I've never mixed with store-bought creatures, this makes it safe to release. I made this on a tiny budget. It's a 65 litre tank with a powerful undergravel filter and a pump to create some current that switches on and off. The only unnatural objects in the tank are the sassy duck (couldn't resist) and the gravel (seemed bad to take that from the beach, so I bought and washed some). There is a 1873 pottery manufacturer (Poole Pottery) nearby and in the past they would dump their broken creations into the sea. Over time these get taken by the tide out of Poole, around Brownsea Island and they wash up on a small beach down the coast a bit (Baiter). This has always fascinated me so I've decorated the tank with little bits of broken pottery and smoothed glassware I've found there.

Currently there is also a hermit crab, pagurus prideaux, he usually has a cloak anemone on his shell (together they form a symbiotic relationship), I collect shells from the seafront for him and another small hermit, a 'hairy hermit'. There is also a goby (fish), a common prawn (many more before but I put them back recently), several snails and a few types of anemone including this lovely snakelock.

My SO's father is a marine biologist and they've both given me a lot of help setting this up. I enjoy it as I get to have a little slice of nature in my flat, observe what they do and not experience any of the guilt I always feel when I keep regular pets. This is just a little crabby holiday. If you're tempted to do this, please read up lots first (although there's very limited information available; if it regards the UK, you can pm any me questions) and please never mix caught and store-bought animals - especially if you intend on releasing - you can spread diseases to ecosystem. This only works for me because I'm so close to the sea; I monitor salinity, temperature and how.. happy everyone looks and return animals if the conditions are not right. I love how fascinated visitors to my flat are about the tank!

For anyone concerned: He's a bit pale due to lack of sunlight for his algae, I guess as it is winter so there is even less getting in. Shall invest in daylight bulb or return to the sea :)

 might wanna check your water parameters, your anemone looks unhealthy(white translucent) inverts such as your anemone are very sensitive and if your tank in under a year or two old its not ready to support an anenome. climbing onto the ducks head which is awesome by the way is the anems maybe a way of wanting more light. tanks always cycle even though you pull your water from the ocean there is a cycle time and doesn't necessarily mean that your tank is ready for anemones. CHECK YOUR WATER PARAMETERS ASAP PLS or he might die on ya

I live in Weardale and they use our valley like there training for the death-star run.Reminds me of Independence Day alien craft chase scene.[Jet noises]I know the pic isn't as advertised but I have been in the Lakes and looked down on a fighter jet flying along a valley, really cool. Don't know if it still happens but you used to get planes buzzing Glastonbury Tor from HMS Heron.Didn't know the C-Eagle is still around in Lakenheath AFB. Nice picture.Extremely high shutter speed, eh?what was the shutter speed on your camera & the f stopHaha fucking awesome shot!

Is it just me or is anyone else freaked out by what appears to be a giant black and white border collie in the background?1) Not the late district.

2) It's the mach loop

3) It's in a different country than the lake district.Nothing better then some major thinking he's funny flying 10 feet above your can at 300 miles an hour at 2am. Yup... Good times [deleted]When I was a kid I saw Concord do a similar thing in a valley in Wales. It was banking the other way as it turned away from us. Had a spectacular sequence of views - Nose on approach, close view of underside as it turned, tail view as it left.

Something that amazed me while visiting America as a european was the Fauna. 

In my country the only chance you'll get at seeing a live deer would be to have a house in the countryside, far from roads, wake up at 5 in the morning, find a random spot near a lake to stay at, freeze your ass off waiting for something living to pass by, finally see a deer approach, deer will see you before you see him, it gets immediately startled and runs off.

In america I literally saw a dude in the suburbs, watering his garden  plants, kids running around, fawn in the same garden, close to a tree, with a doe eating the watered grass.

I  saw so many animals, buffalo, deers, elks, wolves, bears I didn't gave a shit anymore, those motherfuckers only blocked the road and wouldn't run off despite me being the top of the food chain !

Edit : thanks to /u/jhnhines I now know buffalo in plural isn't ""buffaloes""I drove through yelowstone.

Was odd for me to see bison up close. Their eye balls bounce with every step they make.

Also I didn't know female bison had horns. I though it was odd when the babies were nursing There were once as many as 30 million of these creatures roaming freely.  One herd witnessed by early pioneers was said to be 10 miles wide by 50 miles long and took 3 days to pass by. About 4,200 bison in 2.2 million acres and they still somehow manage to block the main roads every day. 


P.S. Not that I'm complaining, just some interesting numbers. It was really cool to see scenes like this when I visited the park for the first time a few months back. In the park, we call this a ""bison jam"". As a tour guide, one of my favorite jokes was that I much preferred boysenberry.I bet this makes a great sound.DO THE JINGLE! DO THE JINGLE!This is no joke. I worked there during the summer as a room attendant and frequently would have to wait for Bison to move away from the doors of people's cabins so I could clean them. They also say give yourself an extra 20 minutes of drive time to account for Bison traffic.Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.and there's always that one fucker milling around, blocking the road, no idea where to be.There was a small stampede of about 50 bison when I was there a few years ago. Some guy tried to drive through it; that didn't work so well. That's how I learned bison always have the right of way. I absolutely fucking LOVE Yellowstone.

Favorite place on Earth.I worked in Yellowstone one summer. The best days were when our van would get stuck in a buffalo jam and we'd get paid just to screw around and watch bison and tourists. Holy shit that's terrifying.That's a steaming load of bull right there.Word of advice from someone that has bison on their farm currently. DO NOT FUCK WITH BUFFALO. They are fast as fuck and don't give two shits. My dad is a park ranger at YNP, and one of his regular duties is doing ""bison patrol,"" which the park rangers refer to as ""human patrol"" aka: ""keep the humans from getting too close to the bison."" I like bison...I like fog...not sure if putting them together was nightmare fuel or not...will update.If you've never seen a buffalo up close, let me tell you something.

They're fucking scary.

A few years back my family went camping up in the Badlands in South Dakota. I basically got trapped for a good hour in the general store because a herd of those fuckers decided to make camp right outside, and if anyone went near them, they'd fucking charge. I also got yelled at by an old guy because some random kids decided to approach the buffalo, and apparently I was the only female in range, hence they were my kids.

Fuck buffalo, man.bye son
Looks mythicalBison are fucking badass. They just so casually do whatever the hell they want. Thought they were awesome when I saw some at Yellowstone. There was one that was eating some grass on the side of the highway, and cars were slowing down and carefully going around him. He just gave no fucks, was just like, ""Fuck you, I'm a motherfucking BISON.""Actually, the traffic is behind the camera. It is the 1315 people who pulled over because someone else pulled over to get something out of the trunk and made everyone think he was looking at an animal, so now a half a fuck ton of people are peering into the brush.

Once they see the bison on the road, at least a quarter of the people are going to ignore rules and good sense and get way too close to the bison.[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)","{'Openness': 0.257, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Sadness': 0.043387, 'Anger': 0.856936, 'Extraversion': 0.664, 'Joy': 0.052157, 'Agreeableness': 0.589, 'Emotional_Range': 0.811, 'Tentative': 0.715, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.803737, 'Fear': 0.520477, 'Conscientiousness': 0.111}","{'abstract': 0.354344, 'tree': 0.668188, 'snow': 0.310026, 'curtain': 0.28905, 'winter': 0.377541, 'forest': 0.28905}"

Makes me smile. :) 
Aw fuck my life. Now I gotta go to the pound.I found my dog outside wandering around my apartment complex. I have found several cats as well. But this dog, I was lucky enough to be awake at 2am on the balcony. And I saw this doggy with no collar and asked my boyfriend to go get it. He said no so I called him an asshole, and walked downstairs and got her myself (I've been attacked by stray cats so I'm weary of getting animals by myself...). She came running up to me shaking with happiness, her tail wagging a million miles an hour. She's a great happy little dog. I tried finding owners, no one claimed her. :(  and I couldn't bear leaving miss happy pants in a shelter.

Edit: This is also why I have six cats.Pic One: ""...all right, play it cool, Luke. We'll make it out of this hole. Just don't wag your...goddammit, they're on to us. Look sad. Goddammit, sadder. That's perfect. Now hold"".

OK, I live here in Hong Kong so I can give a little insight here. Hong Kong has the most expensive housing market. To buy a house here you an buy a small mansion in the UK. But to compensate for this, mostly everything else is dirt cheap (public transport, food at the right places and anything else). Here you just have to live with what you've got.More photos of HK apartments by Benny Lam [here](http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/society-for-community-organization-cramped-apartments). The photos were featured alongside others in a 2014 exhibition, called Trapped.

You could buy a mini-Mansion in most states for what he quoted...Whats with the phone? Looks like it's taking up a prime bit of space, and there's a smart phone next to it.Where do you poop? I am HongKonger and I can confirm you there is no exaggeration in this photo. The housing price has been incredibly skyrocketing for last 7 years. It is because HongKong follows the exceptionally low interest rate of USA AND enjoying the influx of China money at the same time!  Chinese governors love to transfer their money to HongKong because it is protected by law in HongKong, and they could get permanent residency by buying properties ( recently canceled though, thank god). How much are they? They bring cash in suitcase and swipe the whole fucking floor at once!! How could the housing price not skyrocketing.   HongKong government has a constant fear that any policy related to China may be considered as an offence to China, therefore they did nothing just watch the things go beyond control. I could not express my anger towards government which do not watch over the welfare of locals but hiding behind the curtain to criticise people being intolerant.

They protect you. They babysit your kids. They miss you when you're gone. They mourn you when you die. They sit with you when you're sick. They have been known to find their way home when lost. They bring you stuff. They lick your face even when you are dirty or smelly. They ride in a car or a boat or a plane with you. They keep old people company. They obey commands. And some will fight to the death to save you. And they'll comfort you when you're down and cuddle up next to you in bed. Dogs, you get all the reddit gold. I just really love this picture. Its so beautiful. 

I met a couple that have raised dogs together probably for at least the last 20 years. They're really active and often go on long walks and hikes around their home (they live in Switzerland). They had this one dog (a mixed Swiss breed) named Cindy they got from a farmer. Cindy had 6 puppies and the couple gave the puppies away to friends and family apart from 1 which they kept and named Calimero or Cali for short. Anyway, Cindy got really sick around 12 years or so and had to be put down. The couple lived on an acre and a half of land and buried the Cindy on their property. Now usually, the couple would let their dogs go out in the evening so they could do their business. They were very well trained and the dogs always came back when they were ready (after about ten minutes or so). Soon after Cindy had passed, the couple noticed that Cali would leave for longer periods of time, at least 30 minutes or so. One night it was lightly snowing so the husband followed Cali's footprints and found Cali at his mom's (Cindy's) grave. He was just walking around the grave sniffing. This picture reminded me of this. Very sweetI regret not taking a picture with my cat when I was younger. Got her when I was 4.

I was 99.9% sure it was abandoned because it was quite a ways from water, only weighed about 1 1/2 lbs and we just had several storms roll through the area. Plus, it came up to me like it was too little to be afraid.

I scooped it up and brought it to an animal rescue. It was confirmed abandoned and they cared for her. 

I of course took lots of pictures of the little cutie that I put on my Facebook. I got to go to work the next day (OB/GYN office) and asked everyone  ""Have you seen my beaver?!""

Thank-you for your attention.I have a pet starling! I found him before he even had feathers. He fell out of his nest onto the concrete and was severely dehydrated, so I took him in and nurtured him back to health.  I've had him for about two years now. He's a great bird! Very intelligent. Very loud...He talks and whistles nonstop. He's whistling the Harry Potter theme song as I type this. Beautiful birds but fucking assholes. They steal anything even if a momma Robin is feeding her baby afucking starling steals that shit from them. They don't care. They're like the honey badgers who don't give a fuck and do what they want.   I have two bird houses for tiny birds. You would think the starlings would be cool and leave it alone.  Fuck no! They pecked the shit out of the holes to make them bigger so they can fit their fat asses in there. Yeah beautiful but assholes.[deleted]Its amazing to think that the iridescence of these animals is derived not from any pigment, but from the structure of the feathers themselves. Microstructures in the feathers interfere with light waves in such a way as to create color where none existed before. Fascinating. Fun fact: starlings, a massively invasive species that cause >$800 million in crop damages per year and once caused a fiery plane crash, are only in the United States because of a single 19th century Shakespeare fanatic.

Long story short: the guy's name was Eugene Schieffelin and he was so obsessed with Shakespeare in the late 1800s that he decided to take every bird mentioned in his plays and introduce them in the United States. Of course, this was before people understood why introducing a new species into a foreign area might be problematic. The Bard mentioned starlings just once -- in Act I, Scene 3 of Henry IV -- but that was enough for Schieffelin.

Nowadays, starlings are a massive invasive species in North America, with numbers in excess of 200 million. They cause massive crop damage, spread disease, kill other birds, and occasionally bring down a jet.

Funny story about the movie, I was watching it at a airport bar, I was using faulty headphones that I just bought but did not work. Like an idiot I was wearing the headphones for about 2 min before I realized only my laptop speaker was playing sound. Well everyone was starring at me thinking I was watching porn as Reese Witherspoon in the opening scene does some crazy grunting and screaming trying to get that boot off.  Closest I could find - https://youtu.be/Wd4qsQXmdRQ?t=1m41s 

~~I can't believe no one has posted a video of the scene~~How did they realize it was from the movie when they found it? I would've assumed someone just unfortunately lost a boot sometime ago and I've seen the film. Still, very neat regardless. Cool, an Astros hat.http://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/reese-witherspoon-wild-boot.gifOn the topic of Reese Witherspoon apparel: My dad was once a limo driver and has a pair of sunglasses she once left behind.This reminds me of a short story in a book I read yeeeears ago where two guys decide to track down where their favorite actor threw a tire iron off of a cliff in a movie he was filming near their town. They track it down, and find it in a cave, and while they're* in there, this cave fills with women, and it's apparently this female cult who's initiation is to have sex with the tire iron so they can basically be having sex with the actor. They take a polaroid of the new girl doing it, and hang it on the wall with everyone else's picture.

I haven't thought about that shit in years, and I can't seem to find the book through google.

(Fixed some typos. It's pretty late, sorry)Did he sniff it?  Park ranger goes out and throws a fresh boot over everyday for hikers to find.Hey, Reese Witherspoon called. She wants her boot back.Another Cinderella story ...Reese Witherspoon? More like Reese WithoutherbootI JUST WATCHED REESE CHUCK THAT BOOT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER!!

I was walking past another and saw the lights were on. I just glanced at it and kept walking. I don't touch anyone's things. But I figured the doors were unlocked. See, we keep the doors unlocked so that thieves just let themselves in, instead of slicing our plastic windows open. So, I spun around on my heels and tried the door. Sure enough, opened right up. As quickly as I could, I snapped the lights off and quietly closed the door. Did I go into someone else's vehicle? Yes :( Did they make it home after class?

Dear students, 

At approximately 9:50 a.m. this morning, an incident occurred in the Criss Library where a student allegedly pulled a pocket knife on another student. 

Reports indicate that the student who pulled the knife was asked to not talk so loudly on his cell phone.

After the student allegedly showed the knife, three students quickly subdued him. The students held him him place, away from the knife, until UNO security appeared on the scene and took control of the situation. OPD was immediately called and is now taking the lead on the investigation.

Counseling was immediately called to the library to serve as a resource to all parties involved, including the students who subdued the student with knife as well as any students in the area.

No students were injured during this incident and the library is open and secure.  Red shorts has a perfect opportunity to tie the perpetrator's shoelaces togetherAlways be the guy by the boots.... its less stabby down thereI've seen more Nebraska related news (on front page) in the past 4 days then all my time on reddit.You're slipping, OP.

Reminds me of the kid who stabbed someone at my high school.

So one day this kid who was regularly in trouble ""stabbed"" another kid at school. Being high school, word got around fast and by the end of the day the rumors made it seem like he [samurai sworded someone's head off](http://i.imgur.com/MHgOmYG.gifv). I think in reality it was just a small slash but still pretty troublesome nonetheless. 

So he went for 2 years at a school for troublemakers, or kids who got expelled. 

Then he got to return to school for our Senior year. God bless this kid, he came into school with a shirt that he made that read ""Stabby is back"" 

Fucking hilarious. I think he made it half the day before they made him change into his gym shirt. [this](https://twitter.com/_dyanrowning/status/596026873735319552)also happened on the same campus today. *just gonna put some jam on this bread for a brain snack while i study*

Back in my day, a college student was happy to have one knife and maybe a handful of bees.Dude in the green sweater is my buddy and is active duty infantry. Poor little knife puller...

EDIT: Yeah it's grey. Colors are hard...

EDIT 2: The backstory is the best. My buddy asked the knife guy to keep it down and that ""no one wants to hear your personal shit, take it out side"". Knife guy proceeds to say ""I'll do what I want, fuck you. I'll kick your ass."" Knife guy stands up and pulls out the knife. My buddy grabs his wrist and twists it while a third guy tries to take the knife. My buddy then throws a quick punch to the face, and gets him to the ground. Knife guy goes for the second knife, which is grabbed and tossed it to the side. The rest is history.

The process that gave us the majority of published sheet music was actually MUCH more labor intensive: published music was engraved by hand as a negative on a metal plate. Handwritten manuscript was used as a source.

Another way of producing music was with photographic reprints.  Engravers would create a page of a score the size of an entire room, photograph it, then shrink it down for a 8.5x11 print.  Hi-res photos before hi-res photos even existed...Looks just about as unintuitive as Finale. Here it is in action:

Apparently they're called ""fairy chimneys"". According to [this site](http://www.cappadociaexclusive.com/geological.html):

>The formation of this strange landscape started during the third geological period, when three volcanoes located on the edges of this region began erupting frequently. The deposits of volcanoes ash, lava and basalt laid the foundations for today's landscape. Earthquakes and ongoing effects of erosion have contributed to form the valleys and the ""fairy chimneys"" that can be seen today.

>As the rock below the top layer of basalt is extremely soft, it can be easily carved. Communities took advantage of this to make their home in the rock pillars and under the ground. Today, these examples of homes, churches and whole cities abound in Cappadocia. 

They even carve houses out of the softer lower rock! [Here's an album of examples!](http://imgur.com/a/LRtTI)

That`s the so-called ""gun that won the west"" and was a super quick cycling rifle due to the toggle-link design.  It had a neat little cover on the top that you could slide over the action to protect it from rain and snow.

That's the gun that's **supposed** to be used in Westerns, the one that would be period correct.  However, in most westerns, including John Wayne movies, the anachronistic Winchester 1892 was used instead, due to availability and I guess it looked more pleasing.  

I'm betting that one is chambered in .44-40.  The gun design was replaced by the 1892 (in you guessed it, 1892) by gun inventor John Moses Browning.  The 1892 never could cycle as fast as the 1873 but it was much stronger with two giant steel lugs that locked into the receiver.  

I have two modern reproduction 1892 rifles in .44 magnum.  Today there are 1873 replicas (made by Uberti in Italy and Miroku of Japan licensed by Winchester).  Compared to other lever guns, they're not strong due to the toggle-link design not having very positive lock-up.  But they're quick so they're used with great success in cowboy-action shooting.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! :)

I bet a billion dollars it's been there less than 133 years.Was a broken tombstone next to it? How about a black and white photo of a blank grave?some rogue probably laid his weapon down there before meeting his maker 130 years ago[deleted]Maybe this is Rockstar doing some very creative marketing for the sequel to Red Dead Redemption. What if it still worked? Imagine what an advertisement for Winchester that would be.He probably went to grab a pint but things didn't just blow overNice little article about it in the Washington Post this morning. I can see the rifle being there for a very long time, especially with the canopy of the tree offering shelter from the elements.

It is a 44-40. Found unloaded leaning against a juniper tree as they were doing some ""what is out here?"" archaeology work.

Juniper have some interesting traits. Whole limbs can die while the rest of tree is fine. The wood can last a very long time in the arid inter-mountain west. Beams found at various ruins have been dated to hundreds of years old using dendrochronology. The amount of wood rot for the butt and stock is really impressive...

OP: What's the back story? Did you find this? If so, where? Have you contacted the local historical society?  
And to quote Dr. Jones: It belongs in a museum.If evolution is real, why hasn't it evolved into a tank yet?That would be so cool if the roots grew around the trigger, and 132 years later it somehow still worked and right as you took this picture it shot youI bet some guy for the longest time was like ""where the fuck is my rifle""Stuff like this gives me chills.  

Assuming that rifle has been leaning against that tree all these years, that means things like the Titanic hadn't even been built yet.  All of WWI and WWII happened, the rise and fall of Hitler.  Hell, atomic tests were happening in Nevada while that rifle ever rested against that tree.  Think of the many days/nights/seasons it sat through.  

Jesse, I done lost my rahful.It almost blends in with the tree!I like to think that years ago some bandit decided he was going to hold up a carriage passing through and hid loaded up weapons around the heist area so he could ride to the nearest one rather than trying to reload his weapons on horse back. Unfortunately the west is a cruel mistress and he was gunned down that day. With it's owner gone, the Winchester stood in wait for it's time to come. 130 years later, battered and aged, it's found.Nevada Native here. I don't know if this is a cultural tradition or just a family tradition, but my family has a ""Family tree."" Out in our favorite hunting zone where when someone passes away, we put their most treasured possession in the tree. We've been doing this since far before I was born with items made since before the 1900's.

I instantly panicked thinking someone found our tree and was going to remove our things, but this isn't the case.Someone needs to ID the tree and see what its growth is like over 132 years. It doesn't seem to be that big and I doubt it's been that size for over 100 years.

Edit: According to my inbox a lot of people don't like my humor. Yes guys I get that the sign came later and the ruts were likely from a vehicle that knocked down the original sign. Also there are probably only two ruts because the car was rear wheel drive and the front tires didn't leave marks whereas the rear tires were spinning out. The tracks are old indentations in the mud.

We start and there is no sign post there, but the base bracket has been installed in the ground, waiting for the sign post. They pull in, roll over the bracket in the ground and stop just after the truck clears it. 

Some dude standing on the back of the pick-up slides the new sign onto the bracket, and the truck pulls away. He may or may not even bother with bolts to attach it or if they are fancy-schmancy, they may have clips inside which lock into place.

Look at the tracks and they are a little straighter just the other side of the sign post. That's where the truck stopped. 

The bracket might be like the one in the picture I provided above, or the piece installed in the ground may go inside the sign post itself, or there may be not a bracket, just a square hole in concrete.

FFS.

Edit: yes i did mean one Simpson. the apostrophe is correct in this context.I wonder how people groomed their nails in olden days.Another fantastic of marble work:
http://viola.bz/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/statue-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-Mary-in-marble-by-Strazza.jpgMichelangelo was around 28 when he sculpted David. please, correct me if Im wrong. I make wood sculptures for a living and can't fathom working with stone like this. One bad chip with a chisel and the piece could be ruined. The patience and artistic ability of these people blows my mind especially since the technology and tools they had is incomparable to today's.It was an incredible moment to turn into the hallway and see the David at the end of the corridor.  The light was shining down upon the statue and I'm not sure I've ever seen anything so beautiful.  As I got closer, to see the detail was really astonishing.  If you get the opportunity to see this awesome work of art, I would highly recommend it!I've spent hours examining the details on his scrotum. Hours. Is this acceptable proof that my throbbing metacarpus vein is not in fact 'weird and scary' It's the look on his face that gets me.  That the mind is our ultimate weapon, no matter how outmatched we are in physical strength.

The whole statue is unbelievably beautiful, though.Does anyone know if the middle finger was broken off? There seems to be a line along the joint, like it's been attached. I was always impressed by the draped marble cloth in this piece at Windsor. The curtains are marble too. http://i.imgur.com/6JaHD5B.jpgPoo fingers That's a lot of detail. This guy should be famous. Are their veins in... anything else? Michelangelo always thought that the figures were trapped in the carrara marble, and all he did was just free them from their marble prison.The first time I saw the David, I wasn't aware that I was walking toward it and was looking on either side instead. Suddenly, I had to stop because I was face-to-foot with David. The detail in the feet immediately blew me away. I think I stared at his feet for a solid 10 minutes before I started looking at the rest of the statue. The entire detail is amazing and to know that a teenage worked on it is astounding. http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/jhm/arch/david/David.htm

I'm pretty sure this was posted on here before, but it's worth reposting for those who haven't seen it. Apparently the current orientation of the statue is incorrect from how it was intended to be viewed. It has a much more intense feel to it when viewed from this perspective. It helps to put it into the context of David's battle with Goliath. I got to go to Italy some years ago and see it in person. I wasn't aware of this before hand but it wouldn't have mattered too much since this article says there's a pillar blocking the view to this angle.  When seeing David in-person it's impressive how big the statue is. It's 14 feet tall without the stand. For some reason I always thought David was just normal size. Pictures in a book don't begin to do it justice. David is blow-you-away impressive!Pieta is one of my favorite sculptors of his.

My cousin called the neighbors over and they scared it off back into the woods. Nobody got hurt and they haven't seen any signs of it coming back yet. They've lived out there for a while now and they know to keep an eye out for it.

This is how Americans cue for the train:

http://i.imgur.com/T0K6Ep2.pngI've seen similar on the Beijing subway. That is until some people just walk straight to the front and start pushing those queuing suckers to the side.

We have a similar issue here in the Philippines, so called VIP drivers who think they're the most important person on the road. Imagine a 4 lane road, 2 going one way and 2 going the other. 2 lanes are full of cars queuing, waiting for the light to turn green. The VIP driver will simply travel the wrong way down one of the other lanes and drive straight to the front of the queue, often causing more traffic on the other side by driving down it the wrong way. It's the most frustrating thing ever when you miss the lights by 1 car because that idiot jumped the queue. And here's [Caracas, Venezuela](https://youtu.be/t5M3hUDHQfE) EDIT: to be fair isn't always that way, here's [another example](https://youtu.be/IrHx5oEMcWI)Here are two more queuing examples in Japan:

I have a very close japanese friend that explained me they are educated like this from the very beginning at home and at school.

They are taught that the country has very limited resources, so everybody must cooperate in order for them to survive and improve their quality of life. When you see somebody using a mask in in the streets it's because that person is sick and she doesn't want to spread it any further.To be fair, I saw the same thing happen in Shenzhen.How have we not adapted this technique in the USA? I live in a small town but my public transit experiences in my visits to NYC/DC/Boston could be described by the phrase 'free-for-all'The idea of the queue is one of the greatest successes of civilization.A strange phenomena I observed while visiting China was that ppl will stand in a perfect queue waiting for the bus. However, at the moment the bus appears, they will leave the queue and storm to the bus. Confusing times. I must have trust issues because I would never stand out front because I fear someone might push me onto the tracksHave lived in Nagoya for ~7 years now.  Pretty much normal.  I don't think the U.S. is much worse though, in Japan they make markers on the floor and such usually to help form the line.  I have never seen tape marking lines or anything back stateside... so it doesn't drive people to line up as much.

2 years ago, a British Airways, Boeing 747's wing hit a building in South Africa. Because the 747's are reaching the end of their economical lifespans, it was scrapped.

[Here's a reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/333sd4/remember_the_ba_747_that_took_a_wrong_turn_in/) about it from /r/aviation last week.[My god, shields, SHIELDS!](https://youtu.be/lDKmSxJkOWA)Looks like my buttholeDamage to airplanes is *ridiculously* expensive to fix, no matter how insignificant.

This makes me cry... Not only the radome, the structure under, the windows... Oh God. Not to mention the leading edge on the wings...Just a radome, come off with a few bolts. 

Edit: The nose radome is made of substantially weaker materials than the rest of the aircraft. They're usually a fiberglass material, so the radar inside of them can penetrate it with ease. especially if it hits your wind screen.

*sorry, turbinesWhen your going through hell, keep going. What the hail were those pilots thinking? That is the expensive radar part that got hit too. I'm honestly more interested in what if any damage occurred to the engines and flight surfaces. Jet engines are surprisingly fragile.Through Jessica's mind flashed all the warning about such storms - that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones.  She felt the buffering of dust-blanketed wind.  It twisted them as Paul fought the control.  She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck.  The metal around them hissed and trembled.  
  
""Sand!""  Jessica shouted.  
  
She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel.  ""Not much sand this high.""  
  
But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.  
  
Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain.  He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.  
  
The sound of their passage diminished.  
  
The 'thopter began rolling off to the left.  Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.  
  
Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion was external.  A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.  
  
*Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour*, she thought.  Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her.  *I must not fear*, she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany.  *Fear is the mind-killer*.  
  
Slowly her years of training prevailed.  
  
Calmness returned.  
  
""We have the tiger by the tail,"" Paul whispered.  ""We can't go down, can't land... and I don't think I can lift us out of this.  We'll have to ride it out.""  
  
Calmness drained out of her.  Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together.  Then she heard Paul's voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:  
  
""Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear's path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain.""

I'm a little salty about parking tickets.This should be on r/shittydesign. Both signs should be on the same pole. I lived in SF for about 4 years and had a couple of motorcycles. I worked downtown and easily found free parking for my bike. There were even motorcycle metered spots that only costed 5 cents an hour. Two quarters you were good for the day. 

If my ex wife and I went out to a busy spot for dinner, I would take a bike and just park it on the sidewalk. The fine was around $30, and over 3 years I only got a couple of tickets.

SF is very motorcycle friendly and the cool weather allowed you to wear a leather jacket year round.And that's how you fucking do that.Must be a lawyer. Fucking loopholes. They'll find them. Following the letter of the law, not necessarily the spirit.There used to be a spot on Armitage and Lincoln like this, but you could actually put a full-size car there.  My roommates and I always competed for this sneaky spot.  I've moved but I'm pretty sure they've since corrected it.  Of course this is in ChicagoYep...I do this every day. I always feel like I am giving the city parking enforcement people a massive giant middle finger. Been parking like this since 2004...not a single ticket. 

It is especially gratifying when all of loop and river north and west loop have been purposefully made so that there are less parking spaces at every intersection corners...look it up. All the corners are now Tow Zones where there used to be an extra parking spot. By corners I mean the first parking space at an intersection is now Tow ZoneReminds me of a scene from [5 Centimeters per Second](http://i.imgur.com/wqX1bkU.jpg).

Pinky out, drinking tea, talking about the Monarchy One of the prisoners of the Sumatran Railway Death Camps was 'Judy', the only animal prisoner of war in WW2. An English Pointer, she was a mascot for the Royal Navy aboard a gunboat before the war broke out. She was used as the ships early warning system- she would bark before anyone could hear the planes approaching. She survived two shipwrecks and helped the survivors find fresh water on a deserted island before they were picked up and transported to Sumatra and imprisoned.

Fuck yeah man, it's awesome that he's doing that with kids.  Talk about a  ballsy move for the community.  Good on him.

I hope this is real.  I choose to believe that this is super real.He already knows how to swim. In pussy.He can't drown because he is too tall to ever be in the deep end.I love how open he is about it.

I'm starting to suspect that I never learnt to do it properly when I was a kid.Good on Brandon Bass, swimming is a skill that people of all ages should have.I took a roller skating class with a bunch of children.  The parents thought I was crazy, but I said they really should be skating too so that they can have bonding time with their children (most of them didn't skate so could have used lessons).  Since I started late, the instructor had the children teach me the things they learned to catch me up.  They were great kids and were very cool about helping an adult learn to skate. :-)   Would take classes with children again.Every human being in earth should learn how to swim.

Learning to swim is out of the question.

Yes, this IS irrational.  Yes, there are other people who share these fears.I think swimming is a basic skill everyone should learn. You don't have to be good at it, but just well enough so if you were to fall in water, you'd be able to keep yourself afloat or able to swim a small distance for help.You would not believe the amount of people who joined the Navy that couldn't swim.

We've been using hawks and falcons to clean up cities for a very long time. Why can't they have a few resident hawks, eagles, or raptors in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy?  The entire square was overflowing with 10,000's of pigeons and made it disgusting with guano everywhere. ""Humans, I have left you. I am gone hunting. Do not try to find me; I am on the wind.

http://bringatrailer.com/2009/01/23/bat-exclusive-amazing-1971-toyota-celica/I had a 2005 Celica GTS for about 6 years. I loved that car. drove great, hardly used gas, had enough power to overtake or merge.  it was incredibly reliable.  

a drunk driver turned it into a tin can on my way home from work.  the entire car was smashed and destroyed... I was pulled out by the Police, without one mark or scratch on me.  they said the car saved my life (I had my seat belt on)

I miss that Celica every day.  it was just such a solid car... never once had a problem.  

oh and the drunk driver civilly sued me and so did her husband under common law...  obviously my Travelers lawyer smashed them, but what a funny country America is...Such a beauty, I lusted after one of these back in the day. The one I really like was the fastback coupe. 

http://gomotors.net/pics/Toyota/toyota-celica-fastback-03.jpgI drove a [1984 Celica](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/997/941/2490470002_large.jpg) in high school, that car was an absloute POS but got me some nice lookin ladies.And now it's a car my girlfriend drives.By todays standards this is a gorgeous looking car but I wonder what the reaction to it was back in 1970 when muscle cars were still being produced in full swing. I have my 94 5 gear Celica and love the hell out of it with almost 250,000 milesSuch a gorgeous car. I remember being 11 in like '93 and going to a Toyota dealership in Denver with my sister to look at a 4-Runner they had. In the showroom they had a brand spanking new White '93 Supra, hood popped open sexiness abound with a crowd of people looking at it. But just behind it was a brand new, yes BRAND NEW [Gold '70 Celica GT](http://assets.blog.hemmings.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/10/ToyotaCelica_700.jpg), it had 75 miles on it, just from driving between the showroom and the service bays every 6 months for 18 years. It caught my eye, I abandoned the Supra, and was gawking at this pristine tiny muscle car looking Toyota. The dealership owner walked up and said why aren't you looking at the Supra like everyone else? I said the Supra was cool I guess, but the Celica was cooler. He smirked. I asked him how much it was, he laughed and said it wasn't for sale, but if it was he'd let it go for $50,000. I wonder if he still has it. The photographer is Dylan Leff and he deserves some credit too: https://www.flickr.com/photos/mojocoggo/  

He makes some fantastic pictures IMO.*Shakes an angry fist*

Slow Down! This is a neighborhood!My 3rd car was a '96 Celica. Best car I've ever had.

I have a Skoda now :(I had a 1978 Celica for a few years in good condition and it was a lot of fun and turned some heads.  A lot of people did mistake it as a weird looking Mustang.

[pic](http://i.imgur.com/N8jFbDD.jpg)I just want to say that's one motherfucking impressive photo.Always loved that specific car.

Always thought [my Corona wagon](http://i.imgur.com/xgnjq.jpg) looked like the Celica's nerdy older brother.Wow. Nice lines. I had no idea. My first car was an '84 celica GT. Actually my dad bought it a couple months before i was legal. When i hit 16 i managed to get him to let me take it out with my friends. I totaled it. He came to tow it - i was certain he would total me. He silently hitched it up. On the way home he finally says, ""so, what do you think of the car you just bought."" He charged me 1500 for it, more than my savings, and gave me 30 days to deal with the wreck. I never got on with my gearhead dad. He offered to rebuild it with me. Short story, at the age of 16 i reluctantly tore an '84 celica down to the block, learned a ton about mechanics (and body work), and finally had a way to communicate with my dad. Funny thing. I know there is no way he planed something like this, of course. And without this event, i can't see how we would have ever related. (He's an engineer, im an English professor)Modern cars are a little depressing.Mmmmm dem Advan Oni wheels.

You are correct with the less than 40 left statement, but do you know how far off you were? There are between 19 and 26 left alive, their natural habitat is all of the Koreas, and some of south-eastern China. (Yes, that includes North Korea. I know, surprising that something actually can leave at will)
The species is estimated to go extinct within the next 10-20 years.Fewer than 40 remain. IIRC they mostly exist in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.2 of them at my zoo locally. A male and a female, who happen to have very loud, disturbing sex all the time. Sadly I think they are not part of a breeding program, so no babies forthcoming.

I personally recommend [International Anti-Poaching Foundation](http://www.iapf.org/en/)  ;-)This is a really amazing picture. I've never seen one with a horn so big. I didn't even know they got to looking like that. Thank you. what's this type of rhino called?

i've not seen one with that type of horn beforeI like his little bird friends.**Solution**: Flood the market with a fake ""Rhino based male vigor powder"" that actually causes impotency or worse. Word gets out, the market crashes?

Repeat with other endangered species, which all seem to center around getting boners.Feel like I'm qualified for this thread, I spent 2 weeks on Mankwe game reserve in South Africa that had about 12 White Rhinos. They are ridiculously passionate about anti-poaching, 60% of the entire reserve's resources go to it. 

Someone mentioned if the rhino was tastier it would be farmed intensively (like the buffalo) and the numbers would recover. A much simpler solution I heard out there would simply be to make the rhino horn legal to trade. This would create a boon in trade for reserve managers who can now make a huge income by harmlessly cutting off the horns. You'd still get poaching but not nearly as much with the demand in China and the Middle East satisfied.

An interesting problem reserve managers have is when a rhino dies naturally. Great, you've protected it and it's lived into old age but now you have $300 000 sitting on the ground and it's very difficult to get rid of it:


**Keep it in you house?**Someone will break into you house, kill you and take it. There are so many poor people living on the edge in Africa, if someone knows you have a horn in your house they won't hesitate.


**Bury it with the rhino?** If rumours spread there's a dead rhino lying around someone will either try to track you to where you buried it and dig it up or force you at gunpoint to tell them.


**Just burn it?** The authorities keep tabs on rhinos in the area. If they find out the horn is gone they'll assume you sold it to poachers and you'll be charged.


**Give it to the authorities?** The reserve owner (Dougal) told a story about this: another reserve owner was flipping his shit, thinking he was going to be robbed any second so he gave the horn to the local police station. The station was mysteriously ""robbed"" a few days later and the horn taken. Authorities can be pretty corrupt.


I never got a straight answer on dealing with rhino horns, I don't think they wanted to tell a bunch of students. I suspect they fudged the law a bit in some way, not selling it to poachers but something else, they wouldn't tell us.

Bit of a ramble but hope you appreciate some background on the poaching situation. Got a few more anecdotes, I saw a poacher while I was there and Dougal once threatened a poacher at gunpoint. A few snake stories: one reserve manager was feet away from a Black Mamba crawling through a bush and another had a spitting cobra slide over his legs at night. Yell if anyone wants me to elaborate.If only they were good to eat, then there'd be millions of them, giant factory farms full of rhinos ready to be turned into tasty rhino burgers. 

Worked for Bison That horn would really fuck up your day Ah, the majestic grey unicorn. 

Edit: counting is really hard. Bicorn. My bad...and guess what, China: his powdered-up horn **still** won't give you a 12"" dick.It is horrible that it doesn't look natural to me with a fully grown hornWarning: when photographing these or other beautiful wild beasts make sure to remove the EXIF data or disable location stamps so that poachers don't get a treasure map! Imgur removes it automatically but other services may not!I was expecting to see Jim Carrey crawl out of its ass.Fuck the people that kill these. One of these days we'll be sat around, telling our grandchildren about majestic giant grey creatures which roamed the savannah, and gigantic bears big enough to climb over icebergs on the north pole, and they'll sit in wonderment and wonder if the stories are true, or just grans old tales she likes to make up. Those birds are going to have a strange empty feeling they won't be able to explain once the rhinos are gone... kind of like my life...Assholes in China driving demand for Rhino horns. 
Hope this guy is in a well protected area.

Who would kill this beautiful creature? Honestly I've never seen an animal as fascinating as the rhino, from the armor like plates to the ivory horn. Amazing creature, I'm glad I was able to live in a time before they are all wiped away. Save the RhydonOnce those birds developed a taste for rhino meat, it was all but inevitable.Biceratops?Why are we killing these things when we could be riding them into battle?!Very interesting read from Wikipedia:

> In 2011 the Rhino Rescue Project, organized by Ed and Lorinda Hern of the Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve in Krugersdorp South Africa, began a horn-trade control method consisting of infusing the horns (while on the animal) with a mixture of a pink dye and an acaricide (to kill ticks) which is safe for rhinos but toxic to humans. After sedating the animal, holes are drilled into the horns, fittings added, and the cavity connected with rubber hoses to a 2 foot by 4 inch diameter metal container of the liquid mixture which is then pressurized. The infusion takes less than 20 minutes of the 45 minutes of anesthesia; because of the effect of the mass of the animals on their internal organs, they are rolled every 7 minutes while sedated. The procedure also includes inserting three RFID identification chips and taking DNA samples.

>Because of the fibrous nature of rhino horn, the pressurized dye infuses the interior of the horn but does not color the surface or affect rhino behavior. The acaricide is expected to cause nausea, stomach-ache and diarrhea, or convulsions for anyone consuming the horn in Traditional Chinese Medicine, depending on the quantity, but would not be fatal; the primary deterrent being the knowledge that the treatment has been applied, communicated by signs posted at the refuges. The original idea grew out of research looking into using the horn as a reservoir for one-time tick treatments, and the acaricide is selected to be safe for the rhino, oxpeckers, vultures, and other animals in the preserve's ecosystem. It was reported that only one out of 150 rhinos treated did not survive the anesthesia.

>It was claimed that the dye can not be successfully removed from horns, and would remain visible on x-ray scanners even when the horn is ground to a fine powder.

I don't know about this particular bug, but the iridescence for lots of insects is the result of complex light interference produced by microstructures in their shells. It's not just due to coloration.[Beetleborgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUwM_mKS4c)Those are pretty cool.I've never seen a more gorgeous bug in my life.I thought it was painted fingernails from the *thumbnail*.  The amount of species diversity on our planet always amazes me. Our planet is so unique and awesome. Wow, those are absolutely beautiful. Awe! They're so cute!So, I've always been interested in insects but I was too dumb to become a scientist. Are there ways to...I dunno...volunteer to collect or identify bugs or help entomologists in my part of the world (aka western Pennsylvania)? I tried googling everything I could think of, but to no avail. Don't care how pretty they are. I wouldn't be letting them crawl on me. All I can think is that they will all turn around and race up my sleeve full-speed. they're like jewels. Isn't there some instance of people attaching them with dainty little manacles to crawl around as a clothing decoration? It'd be worth it to keep them fed and healthy.

I remember thinking as a kid that my cat and dog would always get cold during the winters so I would always try to force them into bed with me so I can cover them with my blankets.

edit... holy crap this exploded

edit 2. Thank you kind person for the month of gold! My first gilded commentdamn that's a cold ass huskyNeighbor - ""It's too cold for your dog to be outside!""

You - ""Yeah, that's how my Grandmother died.""

Neighbor - ""From being left out in the cold?""

You - ""No, from not minding her own fucking business.""Last winter I tied my Siberian husky with about thirty feet of line to a tree in my front yard while I shoveled the driveway. My neighbors did this really passive aggressive bullshit where they stood by their door almost out of earshot and said things like ""he better not be leaving that dog out there tied up in the snow"". 

She's only tied up because if I don't, it's a two hour marathon chasing her around the yard in the snow, because she will refuse to go inside. If I leave her in while I'm outside in the snow she sits at the front window and cries.

But out of all that, what baffles me the most is, it's ok for a human from a moderately hot climate to be outside for hours shoveling snow, but an animal bred in Siberia has to be inside.Do your neighbors bring all of the neighborhood coyotes and raccoons inside to sleep with them?Our Great Pyr is the same way.  Last year during one of the Polar Vortex spells, it got down to -35 degrees - the damn dog STILL refused to come inside.  Your neighbors are idiots... It's not hard to figure out that a SIBERIAN husky likes the cold. I had two huskies growing up. I got an anonymous not in the door one day when I was home from school about how it was ""cruel to have [my] dogs cry and whine in the cold while [I] sat inside a warm house"". That person obviously didn't see the 15 times I let them inside for all of 5 minutes before they started panting, overheating and scratching or whining at the door to be let out. They didn't care about the cold they just wanted to be with me, but fuck me if I was going to spend another 2 hours out in -30C with them.I had a husky/wolf hybrid  when it snowed, he got *so ridiculously happy*.He's not husky he's just big boned. This reminds me of that one ignorant white-knight redditor who stole one of these ""freezing"" dogs.My neighbors have huskies.  I've got not problem with them staying out when it is cold.  I just get kind of annoyed when they are out an it is 100+I had an Akita- German Shepherd mix, she loved the winter, she'd run happily through the snow all day. On the -30 days she'd be just as happy, she used to tease the American bulldog the neighbour had because he didn't like walking through the snow until she padded the snow down enough he could walk through it without it touching him, I sure loved that dog and miss her every day :-( My friends neighbours said the same thing about his husky.  The SPCA came to his house because she complained they were neglecting the dog.  My friend showed them the heated water dish and they laughed it off and played with her for an hour in the snow.Your neighbours are crazy. Dogs are bred for different environments. A husky in the snow is just as natural as a Chihuahua in the heat. Of course within reason for both cases.

True abuse is when you see someone in Fla buy a husky and wonder why it's so lazy. Or an Alaskan with a Chihuahua wonder why their dog shakes so much. Other breeds merely adopted the snow; Huskies are born in it, moulded by it. They don't see the grass until July.snow is an insulator, thats warmer than the concrete We had a Bernese mountain dog and the days when it snowed were the happiest of his life. The colder and windier, the better.   
 I remember one day when it was snowing so much, you could barely see 3m in front of you. He was in the yard and bang on the door, but when someone came to open it he'd run away and jump around in the snow again. We were all sitting in the living room by the fireplace and he'd look at us with ~5cm snow on his head, as if he wanted to say ""Are you crazy sitting near the hot thing? It's fucking *snowing* out here! Come out"". Maybe your dog howls and barks a lot, I hear huskies are pretty noisy dogs. A friendly reminder from the American Veterinary Medical Association:

*Cats and dogs should be kept inside during cold weather. Its a common belief that dogs and cats are more resistant than people to cold weather because of their fur, but its untrue.

I like how the reflection in both eyes match.

Always found that annoying in paintings..Made me smile. ThanksYou create an amazing sense of light and texture in this, well done! Ok I love this picture but everything I see now seems to be digital and not painted by hand with a brush on a canvas (not sure which category this is).  

 Can someone in the industry explain to me why this is not differentiated when presenting work?  

I would prefer to see, for example, ""I digitally painted a bird"" as it gives me a clearer idea of the talent I'm looking at and what kind of work went into the piece.  

Is there something I don't understand? Remember when I sat next to you in high school art? ... Stop being a creeper..  But I'm watching you..

Also, is it cool that I knew you did this even before I glanced at the name If the poster? Good work son.This is really nice, and I just came here to say that it made me smile...

He whispered to me in the same way (I'm a dude though). 

Joe, two of his sons and part of his campaign team were all finishing up dinner at the same restaurant where my then fiancee and I were eating. As we walked out, we waved, and he invited us over. Joe introduced us one-by-one to his entire group, shot the shit with my fiancee and I for a good 10 minutes. Nothing about politics, just shooting the shit. 

After part of it, he pulled me aside and gave me the whisper. ""Your fiancee is much better looking than you.""

Wait, what?

""I'm in the same boat, Jill is way better looking than me. I married up. You need to marry up, OP. Don't let her figure it out.""

When it comes to being a public figure, a real politician, this dude is a fucking PRO. Despite his reputation for putting his foot in his mouth, he's one of the most charming human beings my (now wife, of course) and I have met. For about 15 minutes at some random restaurant in Davenport, Iowa, my wife and I were the center of Joe's attention (and his family/team). He was all but out of the caucus polling at that point, our votes were meaningless to him by then, yet he was gracious and genuine and friendly -- and totally 1000% right about my future wife.

About 3 weeks later I saw him back again and I asked why he was back.  He said ""They found the snake.""  They did.My buddy has one and he randomly escaped one day and he was gone for a month, my buddy expected the worst...then one day there his lizard was, back in his cage like nothing happened.This reminds me of college. 4 of my friends rented a house and one of them had a Tokay Gecko named Keyser Soze, which ended up escaping. 

These 4 guys kept this house in perpetual disaster. In south Ga any home kept in this state would soon become a Joe's Apartment sequel. But for some reason you would never see any roaches or bugs feeding off of trash and partially discarded things.

Nearly a year later, while crashing at their house I went to the fridge for another beer when I saw a blur scurry across the surface of the fridge door. It freaked me out because the kitchen light was out. ""Mice can't do that!....Mice can't do that!"" I shouted out loud. 

I grabbed a flash light and cautiously approached the space between the fridge and the wall. As soon as I turned the flash light on I was greeted by Keyser Soze's satan like hiss. That mean ill tempered fat bastard had been doing just fine while keeping the house pest free. I can imagine your coworker making fun of you. While you slowly become mad, start walking around the shop with a net, talking to yourself. You grow a beard, can't sleep at night. You see the lezard everywhere.The pet shop I used to work at had a lot of escapees. I remember the time 8 feet of Burmese Python fell from the ceiling in front of me when I was playing with a puppy to give it exercise. We had a lizard escape at my house. Didn't see him for an entire year. After a while we got a puppy. One time I couldn't find the dog so I called for him again and again. He finally came over, but there was something in his mouth. It was a completely dried out lizard. My dog solved the mystery. I still have no idea where he found it. There were two leopard geckos that escaped when they were super tiny, as small as petsmart ever carried them. They went under the reptile cage unit and we couldn't get them out.

Lucky for the geckos we we had at least a dozen crickets escape from our bins each day and there were always cockroaches running around.

3yrs later and those two were fat and happy, still with the run of the store. I'd only see them at night after closing and it was always from a few aisles away. Last I heard they'd never been caught but no one has seen them for a couple years now.There was a big albino corn loose in our shop years ago as well.  Every one thought I was nuts and that it surely was dead and gone. But I kept finding shed so I knew. 3 years after it's initial escape I found it basking on our front steps where it had gotten out after we propped the door open. If I were your coworker I would say that lizard is actually my pet lizard I just brought in and let loose to mess with you and ask for it back. Then the next day release it again in the store and get everyone else to ignore any signs of it to make you question your sanity.

Edit: Thanks for the gold benevolent stranger.The pet store near my house has a [Tokay Gecko](http://imgur.com/Q7mVUYj) infestation. They say it's been that way for 20 years or so, and if a kid finds one they are allowed to keep it as long as they buy a terrarium for it. I went to my local shop the other day for some fishies and helped find an escapee! They had the rodent cages ""down for maintenance"" and during checkout I spotted a fancy albino rat. The worker was absolutely horrified to see it, I don't think she liked rats much because he was very obviously a pet rat, not an albino street rat or something. Anyway, kinda nice to know its not just my local store with escapees![Here](http://i.imgur.com/raMd5lx.jpg) he is back in his cage. Waiting...Judging by all the love this post is getting, I guess you should change his name from ""Bigfoot"" to ""Karma Chameleon""...Uhhhh OP I hate to break this to you but there's nothing there that's just an empty netHis feet do actually look quite large. Huh.My snake disappeared and I thought the dog ate him. Turns out he was hiding in my mattress for two weeks.We have a couple dwarf hamsters lost in mine! We have competing theories. I believe they've created a tiny little colony and are living off the food we spill under the cages. Others believe they're just dead. I'm staying optimistic like OP!My suite mate's Savannah Monitor, Charlie Murphy, got loose, and for a month, we assumed he'd left the building or died in one of the heaters.  One day while actually having sex with my real girlfriend, I hear her scream ""CHARLIE MURPHY!""  I jumped out of bed naked, scooped him up, and ran around the house buck naked with him as a victory lap!  

I miss college.  Story time! I used to own a 5ft iguana (Iggy) and I let him roam the house like a dog would. I used a huge jewelery case as his cage and he would go in it to use the bathroom and drink water. Most of the time Iggy would chill out on top of the radiator but during the summer he was especially hyper and would sometimes run out the front door. He would climb the tall bushes in the front yard and scare the shit out of people. Funny enough, the only way to lure him down was with pizza. Iggy sure loved his pizzaWasn't something exactly like this posted almost a month ago or so?I used to work at a pet store back in the day and 2 tokay geckos got loose once. in case you're unaware Tokay Geckos are mean as fuck and will bite the shit out of you for no reason. they also make death rattle like from The Grudge when they are pissed. so for the course of a year or so it was like a horror movie. you never knew when you would stick your hand in the back of a shelf and hear their war cry and you just knew you're about to get the shit bit it out of you. Heard one about a pet shop where their fish kept disappearing from the fishtank every night. So one night the owner stays late, and he hears a splash sound. And a SQUID takes off the lid, crawls into the next tank, eats a fish, and goes back into his own tank. It's only a matter of time before they knock us off our position at the top of the food chain. Squids with machine guns man. That's what's coming.I'd get him checked out for metabolic bone disease. That's a year without calcium/d3 supplements or proper lighting.Toadaso. I fuckin a toadasoWhen I was younger I spent about two years working at petco.  Our store had a fully functioning ecosystem outside of the enclosures. We'd spot snakes, lizards, hamsters, mice, rats...you name it.

Jamie Hyneman's 'Arborist' Quadcopter Test: https://youtu.be/1fe9IDx3vCsThat is the mother fucking saw from Mario Brothers that runs on those goddamn wires. HOLY SHIT! I've seen this thing in action before. I was at my house in Wisconsin and some guys knocked on our door. They told us that we'd have to move to a different location while they cut down some trees nearby our house. A power line runs between our house and the suburb a couple hundred feet over. In comes a helicopter just like this one loudly sawing away at the trees near the power lines. It was in and out in a few minutes.

I just realized I'm bad at telling stories. I thought it was cool to watch though!

> ""Black Hole"" is a series of images, which shows paint modeled by the centripetal force. The setup is very simple: Various shades of acrylic paint are dripped onto a metallic rod, which is connected to a drill. When switched on, the paint starts to move away from the rod, creating these amazing looking structures.
The motion of the paint happens in a blink of an eye, the images you see are taken only millisecond after the drill was turned on. To capture the moment, where the paint forms that distinctive shape, I connected a sensor to the drill, which sends an impulse to the flashes. These specialized units are capable of creating flashes as short as a 1/40000 of a second, freezing the motion of the paint.

It's a cold, snow-covered day in the encampment of our HEROES, a LEGION in the mysterious land of Québec. Winds howl, hockey pucks roll by like tumbleweeds. 

A voice, grizzled and ancient. 

VOICE

(V.O.) 

We never thought we'd find ourselves so far from our homelands. Toronto, Vancouver, Regina... Even Windsor seemed a distant memory. Forgotten by our many full moons and sunrises in this land... The Molson did not help the fog that overtook our past along with time. 

A HAND reaches into the snow. It pulls ice of deadly nature out of scene. The Canadian Legion stretches and yawns to awaken as they march to a Tim Horton's.

A few years ago, a winter storm blew through NE Arkansas and started icing up our dish on the roof. Since I was running the board for a Cardinals baseball game, I had to make sure the ice didn't interfere with the signal. Every hour or so I would go to the roof and smash ice with a $2 mop.

The sadness I just felt for myself can only be cured by a piece of cake.70 rich is 50 regular person.TIL I have the body of a fit 70 year old man.I'm officially done judging those gold digging 20 somethings for their relationships with older men. Is it just me or is that one massive dick?Well one thing that is interesting is that Harrison Ford is an able handyman and carpenter. Early on after he moved to Los angeles to do Radio voice overs he became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two small sons. While working as a carpenter, he became a stagehand for the The Doors. He also built a sun deck for actress Sally Kellerman and a recording studio for Brazilian band leader Sérgio Mendes.

What landed him his big break is funny. In 1972 He was hired to build cabinets at George Lucas's home. who subsequently cast him in a pivotal supporting role in the 1973 film, 'American Graffiti'. Lucas and Ford became good friends after that. In 1975, Lucas hired him to read lines for the actors auditioning for the film Star Wars. It wasn't until he had done line readings for a couple months that George Lucas, with the studio's ok, gave him the role of Han Solo.

Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the behest of local authorities. During his assigned duty time assisting the Teton County Search and Rescue he has aided in two mountain rescues. On one of the rescues Ford recovered a hiker who had become lost and disoriented. The hiker boarded Ford's helicopter and proceded to vomited on him unaware of who the pilot was until much later; The hiker is quoted as saying, ""I can't believe I barfed on Harrison Ford!""

I guess she will have to be her own best friend now.Every time I see Harrison Ford, I get the feeling that we are all bothering him. 

I think it makes me like him more.He chose... WISELY.I can't believe that man is 70.  That's just ridiculous.  I would bang that like a screen door in a hurricane.I think I gayed a little...Argh can't believe he is 70.. So many legends over 70 we better appreciate while they are with us : Freeman , Hackman , Eastwood , Hoffman, Connery , Pacino , Nicholson and finally De Niro who turns 70 in August. Golden generation for sure.I'm wondering if he's on TRT.This man is responsible for so many of my earliest lady boners. Whoa, so in Indiana Jones his dad was played by Sean Connery, who is 82. Only 12 years older. That Calista knows what she's up to. I am 50 and I just retired my earing that I wore for a least 20 years because I realized how ridiculous it must look.....however props to him for staying in great shape. 24 yo here, i'd bang him. the earring kind of ruined it for meHGH.

http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/

Their most famous member is John Dobson, who apparently just died. He invented/popularized the telescope design that the OP's photo shows - it's called a ""Dobsonian"" mount.

There's a documentary about him called A Sidewalk Astronomer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sidewalk_AstronomerSo did you take a look at jupiter?We need more people like this who want to share the amazing parts of the world, just for the satisfaction of opening eyes to new things.Holy shit I would jump all over that.

Where was this?On our honeymoon to Hawaii, my wife and I went to a roof top observatory at our hotel.  There were about 10 other couples for that viewing and not one of them ever stopped talking and half the people didn't look through the fucking telescope.  Here was this super enthusiastic guide with a very expensive telescope and a super dark sky, trying to talk and these fuckers were completely ignoring him while having their own conversations (loudly).  It was $25 a person and absolutely awesome.  To this day I have no idea what the fuck those assholes were up there for.  Really Cool, not at all sad. lots of people have never looked through a telescope, ever. It's really something!!Some people just want to watch the world learn!Except he is blind, and the telescope is pointed at the sun.A couple years ago while camping my kids (12 and 10 at the time) and I set up our good set of binoculars on the tripod to look at Jupiter. While wasn't much more than a bright dot you could also see four of the moons quite clearly.

As we were looking a girl in her early 20's walked by and asked what we were doing. My oldest (a budding astronomer) explained in detail about the planet, the moons, distances etc. Pretty soon we had a line of people wanting to look with my junior astronomer giving lessons. 

People are hungry for this kind of thing. All it takes is giving them an opportunity. 

And my kid learned when to just shut up and nod when some drunk guy started in about some conspiracy about satellites instead of trying to correct him.the old shoe-polish-on-the-lookie-hole gag... *classic*I took this iPhone photo of Saturn through a telescope like that.

https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/166042_163324527169509_914007427_n.jpgPlease explain how it works at day?There's a guy that does this down by the marina in the town I grew up in. He sets up like 3 or 4 scopes for anyone that wants to look. One of them is a big Meade LX series. I think it's the 8 inch. That's a big heavy thing to lug around and set up and he does it like 3 nights a week. He's a real cool dude.This man and his telescope alone could inspire a child to pursue science and astronomy and that would be beautiful. My former neighbor (an astrophysicist) used drop fliers all around the neighborhood inviting people to come join him for skywatching out in front of his house. He'd set up his telescope and enthusiastically talk about the things we were looking at. Unfortunately no one other than my family ever bothered to show up. They didn't know what they were missing!In the tradition of John Dobson.. some good old sidewalk astronomy! :)I think that's awesome that he is so excited about it that he wants to share it with everybody.  Far worse ways to spend your retirement, like feeding coins into a one-armed-bandit.I miss my grandpa. :( This same fellow showed me Saturn outside a dark bar in New York City 20 years ago.  It changed my life forever.A good buddy of mine got his PhD in Astrophysics . . . while he was in his program, he was very involved in outreach.  He sometimes set up telescopes on the streets of Harlem, and told me about a mother who cried when seeing the reaction of her kid as he looked through the telescope. That's damn cool, and perhaps THE most expensive telescope you will ever see in your entire life. That model of telescope costs thousands of dollars.

The only more powerful ""commercial"" scopes available are the types that are ""fold-out"" (look em up - basically what OP posted but with additional tubing/magnification). You will typically ONLY find these the fold-out type available to the public during public dark site meetings. 

Usually the only people who get to use such high powered equipment are those who own them, those who are in the field, and students at universities that attend classes which go to dark sites (AND, those who attend PUBLIC dark-site meetings, which very few know about).

I had the great joy in my life of taking an astronomy class (a great interest of mine, but no where near my degree) in which, for a grade, we had to attend a dark site twice. It was AMAZING. I actually got to see Saturn AND it's rings through one of these ultra powerful type telescopes. I was even able to snap of a picture through the eye port with an old film camera of the rings and when developed you could still make out the rings. 

I strongly recommend you look up local 'dark sites', which is where you will find FREE use of sweet shit like this.

I just hope this comment gets a few views, instead of all the bullshit comments that are at the top.I would of spent as much time as he was willing to give, talking to him. A lot of people see older folks as a nuisance but I love learning and interesting talk so I often talk to older folks. Especially ones with awesome telescopes who probably share the same great interest in space like I do.The man who invented that type of telescope mount, John Dobson, used to do that exact thing.  He'd setup a telescope in public for anyone to look through.  He died this year.I set mine up at the local park during the last eclipse and during the transit of Venus. :)I was reading a post yesterday about awful it is when older people act more arrogant, greedy, and just generally more unpleasant as they age. The consensus was that a lot of these elderly folks simply reach a point where they say ""fuck it,"" and just don't give a shit anymore, which often leads down a negative route of insensitivity and apathy.

This fuckin' boss of an old man, however, has taken the ""fuck it"" attitude and harnessed something truly amazing. He's decided, ""fuck it, am going to take my telescope-in-a-red-suitcase-with-wheels, set up shop in a parking lot, and *give* something to people. A different planet every day. No, every hour. Fuck it, doesn't matter, because I'm the fuckin' guy in charge, and I'm the one who decides which planet my fuckin' interchangeable sign will display.""

It's a closer look at the universe, a glimpse into the past, and a bit of magic all rolled into one.

I ""technically"" helped build it by putting in the point of sale workstations throughout the ship (there are literally over 300 POS terminals on that ship).  I had an AWESOME outside cabin, and made the crossing from Turku to Miami.  I hooked up with a nice voluptuous girl from Wales (great body, bad teeth) and got very drunk very often.  We even had a kickass Halloween for all the contractors.

But after seeing how the crew lives, there's no way in hell I'd live on that thing.  Three months was more than enough time for it to get old, even with all the amenities.  That being said, the food was amazing, the shows were amazing, the Steiners were amazing (those are the insanely hot ""spa chicks"") and the bars (there are 17 on the ship) were kickass.  We tested them all (luxury of being a POS guy).

RCCL is a great company.  They're NOTHING like Carnival. Can't wait to see Titanic II make her trip from Southampton to New York in 2016.

#1: my friend is balding.  The Dalai Lama walked up to him and put his hands on his head and said:  ""I shave my head so I am bald by choice.  You are not so lucky.""

#2: My friend was watching a hallway as the Dalai Lama passed behind him.  As he walked past the Dalai Lama ticked him on the ribs.

#3: The Dalai Lama kept ""pranking"" the direct line to the security people.  ""are you still there?  Just making sure.""

#4: The Dalai Lama called the security people to say ""There's an intruder in my room! ""  So in rushes the security task force to clear the room.  He gleefully pointed to a spider in the room ""There he is, can you get him outside?""funny story: my husband was working security for the dalai lama the week before our wedding. during the trip, his holiness caught a stomach bug, but eventually recovered and my mister returned home with some great stories and photos...and a stomach virus, which hit just in time for our wedding day. BONUS: i got the stomach bug too, on the plane on our way to the honeymoon. I too have worked security for the Dalai Lama. The most memorable part of the experience was not his wisdom, it was his affinity for baseball caps. He said it was because the top of his head was sensitive, but I think he actually gets a kick out of the reactions the hats receive. He changes hats based on where he is. I was at a college in Iowa; he initially wore a plain cap, then switched to a cap from the college. The crowd went wild. ""What a cute and fluffy security you are""[Liar, the Dalai Lama doesn't need security](http://weknowgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dalai-lama-sunglasses-laser-eyes-gif.gif)Security? It doesn't look like he could protect the Dalai Lama from anything more than harmful UV rays or maybe a light drizzle.So, I tell them I'm a pro jock, and who do you think they give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama. The flowing robes, the grace, bald... striking. So, I'm on the first tee with him. I give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks one - big hitter, the Lama - long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this glacier. Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga. So we finish the eighteenth and he's gonna stiff me. And I say, ""Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know."" And he says, ""Oh, uh, there won't be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness."" So I got that goin' for me, which is nice.The Tenth Doctor is the Dalai Lama's security guard???Awesome! The Dalai Lama made fun of your friend's neckbeard!Stroking his neckbeard. Awwwww.Tibetan here.  

Back a half-century ago, my grandpa used to be on the cabinet for the Tibetan government, back when Tibet was independent.

Sorry for the poor quality.""We put liquid paper on a bee, and.. it.. died...""Lots of chumps win the lottery. YOU, my friend, found a white fly. :)I'm not sure that's an albino fly. Albino animals have skin cells that don't produce melanin, the molecule that turns skin 'dark' (and some other mechanisms but that would take us too far).

Insects don't have exterior skin cells, they have an exoskeleton. So the development of 'albino' flies is radically different from that of Tetrapoda. Also, the black colour of chitin, the molecule forming the exoskeleton, is caused by the natural darkening of chitin in reaction to exposure to oxygen. So I think this is just a white fly, not an albino fly.This fly is NOT an albino.  There are over 153,000 different described species of flies in just about any color imaginable, including many which are white.  All that you have found is a different species than you are used to seeing, but that does not make it rare.  This is some type of Calyptrate fly, but in order to determine any further you would need to look at the wing venation and body spines which are not clear in this picture, and I am not a fly specialist.

Source: systematic entomologistOh, hey, we're studying *Drosophila* in my Genetics laboratory. This fly, a male (you can tell by the sprouting thing on the end), appears to have just one mutation I can see. The body has the lack of gene(s) for color, but the eyes show the dominant phenotype, red. It also didn't receive a mutated wing size genotype.It looks like it has just eclosed from the pupae. As it dries and hardens up the colour will become stronger.

argumentum ad auctoritatem: My PhD involved fruit flies.I'm not /u/Unidan , but this fly is most likely not albino.  Arthropods have an exoskeleton and the only way for them to grow is to molt, or shed their exoskeleton.  After they molt, the partially-complete exoskeleton is soft and typically more pale.  I have a Madagascar hissing cockroach, and it turns white when it molts.My uncle once saw an albino polar bear.""Help me!  Help me!  Ahhhhhhh!""Pretty white for a fly, guySeth Brundle was here.

Talked to a family friend that's a bird expert and they explained it to me and told me how to get the bird to stop. You just have to move your car away from that area for about a week and the bird will go away.

Basically, the bird sees its reflection and assumes its another bird encroaching on its territory. So it freaks out at your mirror, basically attacking it, so that the other rival bird will go away. But because it's a bird it doesn't realize that it's a mirror and not another bird. So, if the ""rival"" (aka car mirror) is gone for about a week, the bird will assume the  ""rival"" is gone for good and leave your car alone.

[The more you know!](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-more-you-know.png)I wonder how hard it would be to train a bird to do this.

...hypothetically of course.Ahhh...  The North-American Red-Breasted DoucheBird.""Damn I look good today!!!"" *shits itself*Hang a rubber snake over the mirror, or put one on the console.

Here's how I imagine the bird's personality:

*Bird flies up to mirror*  
""Oh, there you are again.  You're so handsome next to that shiny, spotless car.  ..It'd be a shame if something... happened to it..""  
""What's that?  Your stomach is rumbling?  No. ..No. - You wouldn't dare.  You wouldn't... A....Ahhhh!"" *squirt*  
""You're such a dirty bird.  Such a filthy, dirty, sexy bird.""Kinda reminds me how I spend my days Would you finch me? I would finch me.I had this problem at my house, a robin was leaving poop smears on my car, and guests cars.  Attacking the mirror.  Probably the whole territorial thing.  

I printed out a hawk picture, in attack position (face forward, claws out), black and white,  put it on either side of the car, and within a week it left the cars alone. 

Since it didn't run away immediately, I wasn't sure if it would work or not.  It seemed to slow him down though, then he finally disappeared.Is this bird available for hire? What are his rates?Shit I look good. Or is it: I look good, shitI've seen this before.  It can be fixed by putting a Crown Royal drawstring bag on mirror when you get to work.  Remove it at the end of the day.His name is KanyeThat's a lot of shit.Must be a reincarnation of a former lover. just another day at the office for that little fellaNegatory Watson.  You see while all these other theories for why the bird does this are catchy and obvious... Using the power of deduction we can find the real answer to this mystery.

I have deduced that this picture was taken sometime in the cold seasons from the drying grass in the background.  Now how is this poor bird going to survive in the cold weather?  By staying warm,  and what is more warm than a black car.  Do black colored objects not get the hottest?   Why the mirror?  It's elementary,  notice he reflection of the mirror, it's reflecting the sun right at the bird as you can clearly see by the bright reflection spot on the car;  keeping the bird even warmer in that cold weather...


So although I is counter intuitive,  the best way to keep your car free of bird poop is to park it in the shade, thus preventing the car from warming up and the mirror from reflecting the sun.

Thank you for postingAbsolutely breathtaking. Thank you for sharing38 hours?  Quit horsin around!Awesome picture, what are you pointed at (guessing Orion) and with what kind of telescope? (if you don't mind me asking)Did you color it yourself? This is beautiful, great job. You should put this in /r/Space too!Too bad you got photobombed by a dementor.This could be a stupid question: The Earth rotates. How did you point the telescope/camera at this spot for over 38 hours?Amateur astrophotographer here. The OP doesn't seem to be answering a lot of common questions so here's my go at it.


The way it works is you have a telescope and a very nice equatorial mount that is polar aligned (one axis aligned parallel to the axis of rotation of the Earth). This basically means once you change the declination (how high you point it) you can lock it down and only need to rotate along the polar axis to track the object. This allows for one motor to control the motion/tracking so that the image is very smooth and doesn't end up blurry.


Images are then exposed usually in blocks of time depending on the quality of the sky, object brightness or various other factors. Next you take the image. Basically, the idea is you have a filter that allows you to capture just a particular wavelength of light and you expose that color for a few hours in total, maybe even all night. This could be in one long exposure or several small blocks. Then you do the same for another wavelength using another filter. The object is to gather as many photons you can while not overexposing the whole image. Then, at the end you stack up all the images and viola. 


As far as could an amateur take this photo, the horse head nebula is actually fairly bright for deep sky objects, about 6-7 which means limit of naked eye visibility. This type of picture is within the range of a very nice setup, and some hobbists really do get into this and spend 10s of thousands of dollars on mounts, scopes, and cooled CCDs to take images. 


Edit: Color for really good photos like these is added after. There are CCDs that detect color but the monochrome ones are better. When taking the photo everything looks grey but when you go to the computer later you assign colors to the shots taken under a particular filter. For example, everything from the first filter is green, next is red, etc. also edit: Formatting. WOW!, this is breathtaking!!! New Background!The colour rendering is amazing. Well done!So where do 24,000 downvotes come from on a picture like this?have you posted over at /r/astrophotography The shape in the middle looks like the almighty turtle-god looking from aboveprobably the best thing I've seen on reddit.

Do they have to be consecutive? If yes, doesn't daylight effect it? If no, how do you get the image to be at the exact spot, with the earth moving and all?

Ah yes, one of the most famous vehicles on the planet.  Some little-known facts about this car:

* It was built to commemorate the bi-centennial anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the Americas in 1492.

* The shark after which it was designed was the same shark that nearly sunk the Santa Maria after biting off Christopher Columbus' leg.

* The shark is actually still alive today.  After a meteoric rise to fame in 1692, it sought reclusion off the shores of Martha's Vineyard.  It was featured almost 200 years later in the movie Jaws.

We also had a minimum grade requirement for our employees.  If their grades slipped they had their hours cut back so they could study.

>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

.


^(For context, I was in an argument with a Russian guy that was convinced that the US was to blame for starting the uprising in Ukraine to begin with.)I remember the largest world wide protest in history against the atrocities in Iraq. They stopped that war too.Good for them. I often feel that the Russian people get roped into a stereotype that they have had no control of. Just goes to show that they are on board with the rest of the world, unlike their leadership.To all the people who say Putin doesn't give a fuck about the protestors: Putin DOES give a very huge fuck about the protestors. That's one of the reasons all this shit is going down, because of the 2011-2012 protests in Moscow, which saw Putin's popularity plummet to an all-time low.

These protests disturbed him profoundly. Now imagine the protestors in Kiev overthrew a corrupt leader and actually made things better? What kind of message would that send to his own people? He is trying to show Russians that any ""revolutions"" will only lead to chaos and pain, even if successful.

He has always tried to keep a balance in his cabinet between reformers and hardliners. The Moscow protests of 2012 showed him the hardliners may have been right all along. 

Also, of course, he sees an historic opportunity to seize Crimea, a strategic port, without any retribution. 
And a million marched against Iraq in London. This changes nothing. Democracy is just the label. Contents may vary. Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.While Reddit is surprisingly sane when it comes to this whole crisiscertainly much saner than many Russian commentersthe complexity of this whole issue tends to be massively downplayed.

First of all, the absolute majority of Russians DO NOT want a war with Ukraine (and those who may want a full-blown intervention are just plain and simple loons). There's great kinship between Russians and Ukrainians, and so any such collision would feel like a civil war. The fact that Putin's rating has soared is simply because Russia feels Crimea is rightfully ours. And frankly, the fact that over the past sixty years Ukraine failed to integrate that region culturally, instead doing quite a bit to alienate it, says quite a bit about why there's so much elation in Crimea and Russia about the peninsula possibly becoming our part.

Secondly, what people here need to understand is that Putin is not, and never was, a dictator whom people abhor. The prison population in Russia right now is at something approaching an all-time low, the standard of living, on the other hand, at almost an all-time high. True, quite a few independent media have been brought to heel; nobody likes that. But there are still influential outlets remaining (Vedomosti, RBC, Echo Moskvy) that, the former especially, can be unequivocally critical.

Thirdly and most crucially, the situation in Ukraine is actually far from being an all-singing, all-dancing triumph of democracy. I don't know if anyone here knows about so-called ""friendship trains""; in a nutshell, those are trains full of thugs that the Pravy (Dexter = Right) Sectorwho more or less dominated Maydan, force-wisepromised to send to the East if they felt the Russian-speaking regions were becoming unruly. (Their interviews may still be available online.) As I am writing this, the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior has confirmed that the shooting in Kharkov was perpetrated by the Right Sector activists. Some of the Right Sector people have openly taken part fighting against Russia in Chechnya and then boasted of the actual kills. Many of them are pure Nazis who will willingly tell stories of how they beat up immigrant women and such. Again, hardly a bunch of people who simply went out for a walk and unexpectedly found themselves in the middle of a civil upheaval. These guys are violent as in ready to kill.

Sure, I don't like the fact that my country is seen as an aggressor right now; and above all I don't like it that I cannot understand what Putin's plan is. I hate it that many Ukrainians and generally liberally-minded people are now behaving as if Russia is replaying some sort of a WWII scenario, and I think it really sucks that a lot of my good contacts are posting all sorts of anti-Russian nonsense. All I am saying is, please don't think we're trying to rebuild an empire. It is more complicated than that.

Oh and yes, even though the whole warm water port reasoning is very valid, I personally think we don't need Crimea; I'd much prefer if it was autonomous, able to negotiate with Russia as a separate entity. The way things look right now, we're poised to have a massive economic clusterfuck.

Edit: many edits.

Edit #2: According to the Kharkov Accords about the Black Sea fleet, Russia is allowed to have up to 25 thousand military personnel stationed at naval bases in Crimea, plus certain types of artillery etc.

Edit final: Thanks for the gold, whoever gave it to me. As for all the other comments which seem to imply I'm some sort of a brainwashed pro-government goon: Guys, the last time I watched TV was fifteen years ago; most of my information is from independent or critically-minded sources. You all seriously need to calm down and understand that there can be PoVs different from your own, and that doesn't necessarily mean that whoever holds them is brainwashed. If it is easier for you to think of Russia as a poverty-ridden country that's armed to the teeth and is only waiting to try and recapture her former glory by unleashing a massive warthat's fine, but leave me out of that. I am not a great fan of Putin and I don't like what's happening in Crimea, but I don't think that justifies being hysterical. Thanks.Who's job is ""people counter?""

We celebrated his one year birthday on 6/29/13.  Died two days later of ligature strangulation from sleeping in a car seat at the babysitters.

CPS promised the babysitter ""would go away forever.""  I don't see the point.  My wife and I both let both of our sons sleep in car seats (if they fell asleep en route somewhere, obviously not long term) and the coroner said it probably took about 4 minutes and was completely silent, so it's unlikely the baby monitor even broadcast anything out of the norm.  Obviously if I had to do it over again, I would restrict him from sleeping in car seat, but he could have died under our watch just as easily.  Or any of my relatives.  We all have left him asleep in his car seat for four minutes.  It was a one in a million chance and my son paid for it.  I still send my other son to the same babysitter and invited her to the funeral.  It really pisses me off CPS came off like that, but my wife and I are the only ones apparently.  I understand and am totally fine with trying to find someone or something to blame, but she did nothing that the vast majority of people wouldn't do.  The rest of our family (mostly hers) disagrees and blames us for not caring.

That said, it doesn't make me feel any less guilty.  I could have switched him over to his big boy car seat we already had, but I thought he was a little small, so I just adjusted the straps so he'd have one inch off his chest in his rear facing.  I obviously must have done something wrong.  I am a failure as a parent, and my wife got her tubes tied after Clinton was born.  I don't really want another child, to be honest I don't think I'm a fit parent as is, but for some reason it just feels depressing.

In movies and books you see the parents break down and sob and scream and cry.  My wife and I certainly sobbed and cried, but we didn't break down.  That happens a lot more slowly.  At first you're sure you did everything you could, but then one week you start wondering.  And pretty soon you're sure you could have done something.  So you start retracing your steps and examining every action.  Then your mind starts tricking you into thinking you never spent any time with him, instead preferring his brother.  Then you start wondering about all of the days he was sick and you didn't take off work to comfort him.  Then you're pretty sure you never really cared for him at all and every one knew it.  That feeling can last a few days before you snap out of it, but I feel like it lasts longer and longer every time.  Something eventually snaps me back to lucidity, but I worry that one day it'll last forever.

I think the worst part is I was on drugs for a good chunk of my life.  I sobered up in January of 2009 (five years on the fourth) so I can't even go back to that.  I feel like my mind is frantically building walls of sand to reinforce my sanity, and that one day the tide will wash in and overtake me.  I have never had thoughts of suicide, thanks to years of depression and finally dealing with it, but I do think about moving my family to where no one knows us and we aren't the People With the Dead Kid.

Anyways, I work as a first responder and the weather has meant working twelve hour shifts driving a vehicle alone by yourself.  Not a big deal, I drive 8/24.  Something is different about 48/96 though.  Your stamina just runs out and eventually you stop having things to think about.  

No one talks about death in infants, what is appropriate and what isn't.  I tried to think about our ancestors for a long time.  How people wouldn't name kids until they were a few years old.  How infanticide is in our genes.  God forgive me, but it helped for a while.  Eventually it always comes back around, and I cannot escape it.  I feel selfish feeling this way.  

I have done this terrible thing that has stamped me and branded me and has become my identity.  If I have a bad day, the only questions I get are rhetorically.  Every one already assumes it's because I have a dead son.  I no longer have minor events that upset me or daily occurrences that hinder me.  If I say it was something at work, people almost seem disappointed.  So eventually you just stop complaining.  People expect you to be somehow above it all, to turn in to some wizened survivor that sees the bright side in life.  I want to scream and complain, but I also feel like that's what they want.  Every one wants their Hallmark moment, where they can drop a quote and be a stone in your Path to Recovery.  Like one day you'll make a toast about how hard it is, but it's okay you've survived and beat this dead kid thing and look at them and give them a weary, trusting smile.  But I don't want a Hallmark moment.  I want a Men-in-Black moment, where someone will wave some wand and make me forget for a little while.  Not forever, but just long enough that I can get a cup of coffee or play a game without this sense that something is wrong.  So my wife can be five minutes late and my first thought isn't that she's dead.  So my son can be sick and I'm not worried he'll die in his sleep.  Maybe I'm just overly cynical.

I don't really want to ""get over"" it or ""move on"" or whatever therapy buzzword exists.  I'm not suicidal, I maintain my work, I am a Good Husband and act like a Good Father, I don't drink or do drugs anymore, so why do I have to make steps?  I like spending a few hours a day crying and remembering and looking through pictures.  I like being at events and imagining what Clinton would be doing.  I like Christmas shopping and making a mental list of what I would have gotten Clinton.  I like looking at bunk beds even if we don't need them.  If I like all that stuff and it's not hurting anyone, why do I need to make steps to stop?

Some memories I've skewed.  That was one of the worst moments, when I realized I forgot what I dressed Clinton as for Halloween.  Pumpkin, but I forgot until I looked up pictures.  That's the thing with memories, eventually the colors fade a little and you've got gray, then you start to forget why it was important at all.  Then every once in a while you go to the zoo and in a rush you gain access to some memory you haven't tapped yet.  Or you pick up an ornament and remember clearly Christmas night and your baby has smashed chocolate all over his face, the byproduct of his brother sneaking him a cookie and his gums doing the rest.  I'm scared that some day I'll run out of memories, and there will be no more moments of clarity.  I think that's the ""meaning"" of life.  Make as many memories as you can and never stop creating them.  One day that's all you'll have left, and a picture is just a cheap substitute.  It's the difference between masturbation and making love.  That feeling of connectivity when you remember how his weight felt, what the animals around you smelled like, how you reached back and he held your hand in the car.  I don't know how or why we create these memories.  I feel like I have all the parts to create new memories:  some times, I can remember how his weight felt; some times, I can remember his dimples; some times, I can remember the smell of baby powder and dried milk.  But like some high schooler stuffed into an art class, my vision exceeds my capabilities.

Anyways, I'm just a bit sleep deprived after the emergency operations and have been thinking about him nonstop.  Came home today at the end of my last twelve of the week and this bill was there.  I had forgotten that we'd have to pay for his care.  There's also a $600 ambulance ride I forgot about.  I don't mean to make a statement on national healthcare or insurance or hospital bills or whatever.  It's just the reality of the situation.  Sorry for rambling.

Thanks for reading.  I've uploaded some more pictures of Clinton:

edit at 2130 EST:  I'm truly, deeply touched by each of your messages and posts.  I've been hesitant to kind of reach out because it felt like family members or other people close to it used my son as a conversation piece, and it always made me so mad (in all fairness to them, that's probably in my mind).  I honestly just expected to get a lot of karmawhoreing replies, which would be understandable.

I reread what I wrote (after a few hours of sleep) and I feel kind of, well, dumb.  I have no idea why in your mind your thoughts sound pathetic and weak, but rereading it on ""paper"" makes it seem less intimidating.  It meant so much to hear so many of you felt the same way.  I feel like a horrible person for having those times I just want to forget about it and have some time to myself, but knowing that it's not insane is comforting in a way I can't describe.  I know I need to see a therapist, I guess I just feel like that's the last step before it becomes out there.

It's amazing to me how sharing grief can make it seem so small.  I cannot imagine going through what some of you have mentioned, stillbirths and losing week old children, or losing a preteen or adult child.  I simultaneously think knowing Clinton's smile and laugh, but not knowing his favorite color or subject in school, makes coping easier.  I could not imagine losing a parent, both of whom are rocks to me, or losing any of my siblings.  I don't know exactly what I mean, but I guess this grief is mine and I couldn't imagine dealing with any other kind.

Thank you so much for offers of financial support, pizza, reddit gold, and other sacrifices.  We are fine financially, I guess it was more the bill was a shock that sent me reeling for the first time in a few months.  The holidays were, for whatever reason, not that big a deal.  Just keeping busy I guess.

I also just want to take this space to say this wasn't meant as a PSA for rear facing car seats.  CPS investigated (no neglect/abuse), and the coroner said it was a freak occurrence.  

Thank you so much for your words.As a parent who has had to go through losing my baby girl, I wept in seeing this.
I still receive stupid reminders from her insurance company, and the hospitals reminding me of check ups. I lost her 6 months ago the 12th, and many friends did not know how to act or what to say. And truthfully, nothing does it. :(
I let her be researched on because of her disease, and have recently had to ask my family to filter out mail about her. Stash it away.
Its bitter sweet to see little reminders... because it reminds you your child was real. A person, and no matter how soon you lose them, you love them...Stunning post. I'm not even going to take the time to put this into a coherent flowing response. I'd rather just post some raw impressions in bullets.

* As a parent, one of my greatest fears is what you are going through.
* I don't know you, but it sounds like to me you were/are a damn good parent and your family got a raw, shitty deal.
* It sounds like, to some extent, you are torturing yourself, but it's your right.
* I hope you are careful to make sure that while IT IS your right to remember Clinton, you don't do it to the exclusion of enjoying your son and wife. I hope that came out right.
* Six months is barely a blip - it's no wonder this still weighs so heavily on your soul. I'd love to say it will get better with time, but I've never been through this, so it would just be a platitude. Only the luckiest go through life without experiencing tragedy - mine was a catastrophic car accident that radically altered my mother's life (and my own) and eventually ended it early. All I can say from that experience is you never really get over it - you just find a new reality, a new equilibrium.
* Don't sweat the medical bill if that's even a worry - I have Crohn's Disease so I always have some pending balance with someone (and I have pretty good insurance). If it's even a concern, tell them you will pay them $50 a month and that's all you can do. Most will negotiate.

This was about the rawest, most honest post I've seen on Reddit. I wish you well and hope that someday life will bring you joy again.New dad here, your son smiles like my son. This is the first time I've ever read something on Reddit at work and cried. Im so sorry for your loss, I cant even imagine. You're a strong person, you really are. I would not be able to handle it the way you did. I work for a Women and Children's hospital and when babies die we do not send the family a bill. We bill insurance and write off the patient portion. We also flag the chart so that anyone from the hospital or any affiliated MD offices get a giant flashing warning when they look up the patient. So we don't mail out appointment reminders and things like that. I never really appreciated those policies before but now I wonder why more hospitals don't operate that way...especially nonprofits. Best of luck to you and your family. I feel the pain man, hardcore.  My 5 1/2 yr old died 4 yrs ago, and i still get bereavement letters from the hospital.  Every. six. months.  It sucks losing a child.  He was was diagnosed with a rare seizure disorder on Thanksgiving day at 7 months old, i was the 1st responder the night he died, everything, and i mean everything changes.  I am so deeply sorry, i hope the two of you heal together.As someone whose one year old always naps in her car seat, I am now terrified.  Is this common? Or even at all preventable?Jesus christ.  That newborn picture got me.  What a beautiful smirk.  I'm so sorry.Its no happy ending for you but your son is a hero. There are several other parents out there whose baby is now alive. Again, it is not a perfect ending, but Clinton's senseless loss prevented potentially 7 other senseless losses. Thank you for sharing your story.It does not get any easier with time, I lost my first born and only son to crib death when he was 3 months old to the day, sep 13th - december 13th 1986.

I understand where you're at but don't second guess anything, we all have our time, if it is 3 months or 3 decades.

Find some support from family / friends and deal with it all the best you can.Sometimes, when I hold my son, I think about how his weight feels or I smell his hair. I close my eyes and think about how fleeting life is and I cherish him more in those moments. 
While I'm doing that, I'm hoping I never have to face a reality where those memories are all I have. 

It breaks my heart that you do. I'm so sorry.

Thank you for sharing your experiences and reminding us all not to take for granted what we have. Your voice is sober and your perspective is too real. 

Tl; dr: I cried. I've handed out these medals. I don't know if you will ever read this. But from someone who works in the field of recovery, thank-you.  If you ever need someone to email and chat with contact me. The greatest things we do require the greatest loss.  I was a emt for 10 years. I have never been in your position but I see it everyday. Good luck my internet friend.I'm guessing this means your baby died six months ago, and you donated their organs, but have been sent the bill..? Sorry for your loss :( I stoppped logging in to Reddit a long time ago, lurking seemed just as productive as the stupid things I wanted to say from time to time... But I had to do so, to say that what you wrote was moving, articulate, so well put and very profound. Obviously I am so sorry for this loss and pain you have to go through- but the insight you have and the way you expressed it resonate with me and I'm sure so many others who have experienced senseless tragedies in life. I'm sorry you have to deal with financial bullshit on top of it. Stay strong.  Sorry for your loss. In 2007, my son was still born; it still haunts me to this day. I wouldn't say it gets easier as time goes by, but you do come to accept it more. As hard as that is/was on me, I can't imagine how much harder it would have been had I gotten to know him before his death.

What helped me the most was making a little memorial out of wood. Nothing fancy, it just gave me a way to express my grief. I made it a few months after his death, but still haven't completely finished it, it just feels to me like that would be too final. 

We also still celebrate his birthday, that seems to help my other kids cope with it. Again, it's nothing big, we just talk about how old he would have been.

As others have mentioned, infant death isn't something that is talked about a lot, but a lot of people have gone through it. It can really mess with you, and was a major factor in several big changes in my outlook on life. Best of wished to you and your family.That was the most powerful post I've ever read on Reddit. I can't imagine the depth of your loss. Thank you for sharing your sweet boy with us. I hope you find peace.All of us only have today. 

I hope that your days make more sense in the future.

 Know that you have reminded a whole lot of people to be thankful for the day that they have right nowI have not the ability to express with words how your post has affected me. Tonight I am going to hug my wife a little longer, a little tighter and I will start shedding tears and she won't know why. Tonight, I call my parents and tell them how much I love them, how much I miss them and how much I regret that horrible things I did when I was a child. May you find the peace you seek OP, may your words find their way to those that need to hear them as well. I am extremely moved by your story and I am humbled by your honesty. Please know that your post has touched every one of us. We may be all be anonymous strangers here, but the emotional connection that we now all share amongst ourselves truly binds us together. 
Thank you for sharing your story with us. Bless you my friend.Thank you for sharing the pictures and your story. 

I know you're not asking, but if you would give us your Paypal account name I would be more than happy to donate to the hospital expenses. Again, it's not out of pity. I want to donate something because I feel helpless to offer anything else. I hope the offer doesn't seem shallow. If you were right around the corner, I would do something more tangible, but this his all I can think to offer. It looks like you donated Clinton's organs. I want to thank you for that. I worked for a long time with children who needed transplants. There are children whose lives are better because your son existed. I know that is a tiny consolation and may even feel cruel. I just want you to know that somewhere, people will always appreciate Clinton and your family.I have been lurking on reddit for a year and change....stupid pics...silly posts...something to read while going to the john....this made me join....I never wanted a child....never wanted a wife....I now have both. I have been so lucky in love and life.  We have a beautiful baby girl named Sophia who is quite literally the only thing worthwhile I've ever created in my life....she is 4 and half months old and just fills me to the brim.  I am renewed every morning by her smile. My cynical, myopic mind is overwhelmed with her joy and laughter. The thought of her gone. Of her not being. Is more than I can take. I started crying after the first line here. She sleeps in her car seat all the time. We hope for it as it makes driving less stressful obviously.  I just can't. You my man are truly one of the old breed. To have the compassion towards the babysitter, to have the strength to carry on being a first responder. To not let your other child fall by the way side.... legendary. I hope I can maybe one day be the gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe. To be a father with such heart and strength.  Truly "" we are not worthy"". I would offer other silly things but reddit seems to have signed in, in this moment and nothing further could be said.  You are loved, your sons are loved, your wife is loved. And the really super cool thing is that, at least for me, all this love has touched me and healed me in ways I didn't know I needed.  In ways I didn't know existed. I want to be for hope, to stand for something other than a quick, cynical remark...to matter...and somehow through your compassion and strength I feel as though a little love and hope has grown inside me. My depression lifts and I think hell yea I can be a father, I can be a husband, I can share and spread love and hope. Dude, you have just changed a young mans life.  I thank you and send you love. Keep on keepin on.I never knew there could be any dangers for a baby sleeping in a car seat. My nieces and nephews all did.I can't relate. I've tried, my mom lost a newborn and never recovered. Best I've read was along the lines of, when a small child or baby dies remember that child was essentially happy their entire life.

Seemed like a nice thought to me, but to be fair I can't relate.He's a beautiful child, and I'm so sorry.  I just have no words.  But I do want to share this video that's like a virtual hug and always helps to lift my spirits.  I hope you find peace again.

How much editing was done on this shot? Also great work it's beautiful!Goddamn. Space.So would you say that you are a ... wedding photographer?From one wedding photographer to another, this is absolutely fantastic. People really need to downvote comments quietly and move on, instead of making comments that end up calling FAR more attention to a negative thought than anything they're complaining about. Seeing all those horrible comments is EXACTLY why I'm not having ANYONE take pictures when I get married.

So what, the girl is ""fat,"" who cares.
She found someone who loves her, and can't wait to spend his life with her.
More than some people on this fucking site can say.Jesus christ, the comments on this are godawful. Beautiful pic and beautiful couple!This is such an amazing picture! I'm sure the couple are grateful to have it in their wedding album. Keep up the great work!That is an incredible shot.

Of all the things I've seen on Reddit about what's going on in Turkey, this has pissed me off the most. A man still in his white lab coat and gloves who was only trying to help the wounded - which is what doctors exist for - being reprimanded, and for what? I'm sure he wouldn't have turned down Turkish Police officers who were wounded. Basic human compassion and empathy really need to come into play here. It doesn't matter what side you're on - everyone deserves proper medical care and someone to help them when they need it. Ugh. This disgusts me. Do you have a link to an article?This happened in Bahrain too.Reprehensible.

It is well recognised that medical and nursing personnel of every grade, rank and calibre is obliged to treat without judgement any person who requires their care where circumstances dictate a duty to act. 

Not only are such arrests contrary to the spirit of that notion, but in making them the State withdraws the care that person may provide even for those it deems 'innocents'. At the point of attacking, restricting the operation of, or causing deliberate destruction to hospitals - field or otherwise - the aggressive body loses all moral and ethical legitimacy. 

In the US recently, the Boston Marathon Bomber was treated and saved from his injuries. In the UK two men shot by police after beheading a soldier in the street received the same. In Iraq and Afghanistan, injured enemy combatants are treated with the same level of dedication and compassion as their Coalition counterparts. 

If the Turkish government try to force this issue they will lose.  what the fuck is wrong with the world man. that's so fuckedWhat's wrong with the rulers of this world! Why can't they be more compassionate (or less barbaric)!Correct me if I'm wrong. Isn't it against Hippocratic oath to deny care to a patient?Dear redditors, I am heading to Istanbul tomorrow. I am an American Turk and the people need your/my help. This image is the tip of the iceberg. If there is something you can do that that will be HUGE, is to write your house representatives for a motion to introduce a bill to halt arms sales to Turkey.  The US always reacts late and only when the sh*t hits the fan do they resort to expensive and dramatic actions like sending weapons and no fly zones. EARLY on much more can be done with a few words.

Here are the list of Medics on trial in Bahrain. Amber Lyon formerly of CNN, went to Bahrain and has exposed a lot of what is occurring there.This reminds me of the Quote by the legendary Mexican revolutionary. Emiliano Zapata- ""it's better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees"" That's how the Turkish gov't acts? No wonder those people are protesting.Same thing in Bahrain.  Even worse.  Yet no one is talking about it. This is unfortunately not a unique circumstance. In Bahrain physicians have recieved criminal punishments for treating the wounded. The truth is that physicians have the integrity to testify to the severity and brutality of injuries. Further, they save lives-and dead men tell to tales. When a state is trying to minimize the appearance of violence, to stop the truth from getting out, members of the medical profession are an easy and ready target. Heavily regulated yet well rewarded by society, the state can easily threaten their licensure, their livelihood and secure cooperation. Everyone acts so surprised about this, like turkey is exceptional. But in Pittsburgh at the g20s paramedics were nowhere to be seen; ans so no inpependent witnesses of the entrapping tactics of the police were available; and no one stunned by riot shells was picked up and taken to a hospital, but was instead hauled in and served with bullshit charges to justify their injuries, without access to media or counsel for hours as the authorities brainstormed how to justify their injuries. At occupy oakland, a marine member of Iraq Veterans Against the War was hit in the head with a tear gas cannister and put into a coma. The trajectory of the grenade launcher means that it's physically impossible to not run this risk when firing it into a crowd. But we all act like this is some kind of war crime in Turkey, a democracy just as (dys) functional as our own. State Violence is a symptom of a corrupt, oligarchic state that can define the borders of debate to exclude whatever doesn't benefit the oligarchs.No matter the circumstance, the wounded deserve care. This is ridiculous. This is Turkey. Don't let this EU, feel good, beautiful country bullshit pull the blinds on you. The Turkish government has always been ruthless and they've hidden and denied it. How will they deny it when it's their own people they are killing. They are not only destroying their own people, but letting them die in the streets. 

This is ruthless. This is modernized Turkey. This is the Turkey that wants to be part of the EU. This is everything that gets swept under a rug and will probably be forgotten in a few months. This is Turkey. Civilization, one step forward, two steps back.I think they can say goodbye to any hopes for getting in EU.When the people really set their sights on the police, this shit is going to get fucking insane.  Its already ugly, but it can get so, so much worse.Just once, I would like to see compassion win.What the fuck? It's part of their duty as doctors to help injured people, no matter who they are, those people took an oath and they're being arrested for nobley living up to it? Disgusting.How do we know this is true based on the photo?  Remember the one about the protestors helping the police which turned out to be cropped? that's really a preposterous thing done by Turkish POLICE ..... more than anything else, this fucking pisses me off.  whoever is in power in Turkey has to go. now.

Great pic, BTW.Best dot ever.And here I am, an even smaller dot on than dot, concerned with my ebay.Stupid Cassini.. taking pics in portrait mode instead of landscape.Nice. One of Humanity's rare group photos. Every human alive is in that photo.Conversely, one of the most profound moments of my life came when I looked through a basic telescope from my parents backyard and found this little brown ""butterfly shaped"" object.  It took me over 2 hours to lineup the perfect angle but when I finally got Saturn in my view I was overwhelmed with emotion.  The lens was barely powerful enough to see any detail of the rings, and it looked a bit like a moth or butterfly... but it was without a doubt ...Saturn.  There is something incredibly humbling about seeing other planets with your own eyes.  thats what the rings look like? dayum thats cool.Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.  - Carl Sagan

Hopefully not masturbating. That'd be embarrassing.My fiancee and I are total space nerds. I proposed to her the evening of May 20th on my balcony, while we were admiring Saturn, which was visible to the naked eye at the time. I did not realize it was out so it was just a nice coincidence that the planet with rings was visible while I gave her a ring.

This photo was taken almost exactly 2 months later (July 19th). The timing and dates are very nice to me, as I will always remember this photo and the fact that her and I were admiring this planet and its rings from that blue dot in the background just a few weeks before it was taken.Here are some more images from Cassini [in stunning HD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNce_8WHTGc).Someone three to four lifetimes from now will be looking at this angle in personCan someone elif how this data gets here?

Here is more about the study abroad program for US undergrads:

http://www.stcloudstate.edu/educationabroad/programs/semester/alnwick/

edit MN karma train.

I think they only filmed here for the first Harry Potter movie. If you remember the scene where they learn to fly broom sticks that was this castle. In addition, in the summer they had local/uk actors hired to walk around the grounds and entertain guests - including harry, dumbledore and hagrid.  

A cool experience and castle. If someone is really interested in doing the program above I strongly recommend fall or spring semesters for more time spent abroad and more opportunities for travel. We did a lot of trips around England focusing on the Tudors, but also other notable historic sites like Hadrian's Wall. I remember a group of us got wasted in Newcastle with some locals and this was just after the movie Old School came out. We had a guy in our group that looked like Will Ferrell so while wasted these local guys at the pub were shouting quite drunkenly, ""Frank the Tank! Frank the Tank."" Still wasted we got on a bus back to Alnwick and we had to make the driver stop so we could piss in the bushes. The level of passive aggressive looks from the kind locals reached new levels in history.

Also, in Edinburgh I remember walking out of a hostel to see the most american guy with a brooklyn accent deliver these classic lines to a young attractive woman, ""Show me your tits. Hey, come on, show me your tits."" It was maybe 11am and the woman was on the other side of the street from the american. No tits were shown.Who's the kid to the right of Harry (as you're viewing the picture)?Good ole Alnwick Castle.

Great piece. Keep it up and keep posting. I see that you sell prints, would you be interested in making this a buyable print?

Please give me details on how I can throw money at you as can receive this in a form that can hang on my wall in my apartment. I would give you fifty of my dollars for that woman holding jack Daniels. I'm also willing to haggle. Ok $75.I don't normally upvote art on reddit. Most of it is either nerd-pandering or straight up content stealing. This, however, is really well done. Just the right amount of (or lack thereof) detail to make it perfect.

Still waiting on a crew to remove the debris from the fire. 

I left work 6 hours ago. There are accidents everywhere and people are abandoning their cars on the side of and even IN the road.

I peed into a cup :( I hate today! 



Edit: 

Can't believe I got gold for this! Thank you! It made the whole situation worth it once I got home 8 hours later. 

For everyone asking why I peed in a cup: I don't have a penis and was on an overpass a few hundred feet from where the picture was taken. Popping a squat in the street while visible to three lanes of traffic was not an option. This is with out a doubt the worst three inches of my life. 
But seriously we left work almost 4 hours ago and haven't been able to travel 2 miles. It looks like an episode of Walking Dead.[Every time I see these pictures](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpvgy2DEcM1qhon59o1_500.gif)
Why the hell do cars catch on fire in the south when it snows? Greetings from Atlanta!  See, we aren't the only ones who can't handle a little snow!  I feel vindicated.Took me over 2 hours to get from Southpoint mall to Brier Creek. People were actually driving on the wrong side of the road, making their own roads, etc. Amazing. I will admit though, even if we had more than two plows, they can't get around when we grid lock the whole city. Fingers crossed they close my store tomorrow :) Glad to see they started a fire to keep everyone warm.

Raleigh redditor.  Can confirm.  4.5hrs for 15-mile trip.  Imagine a city of 400,000 people all leaving at once.  Add frozen water.

To the people surprised at the abandoned cars, I left for work with half a tank of gas.  Barely had enough to get home.  I imagine others fared worse.A closer [photo pf the burning car from /u/lerasi](http://i.imgur.com/GiHLyDK.jpg) in [/r/WTF](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1xr3uk/currently_in_raleigh_nc/)My ex girlfriend's aunt lives in Raleigh.  That's probably her car.  Or at least I hope so, that woman was fucking psycho.I live in Raleigh. The storm came faster than I had expected. I had to abandon my truck, and run 2 miles in the snow carrying my case of beer and bag of Hooters wings wearing running shoes and a light sweatshirt. Sure I might be an idiot, but at least I've got wings and beer.I was in this too and 15 minute drive turned into two hours.  I was floored at the amount of traffic, but I think that the speed with which everything was absolutely covered played a big part in all this madness. People waiting too long to head home then everyone left at the same time. However, the roads weren't that bad in the beginning. I didn't see anyone going through intersections, making turns, etc. slipping if they took their time, but it appears it got worse. Again though, the amount of traffic was mind-blowing.  I hope you're safe OP! 

Props for getting the Freds Beds truck in the photo. I realize this isn't going to be seen because I'm late to the party, but here's the deal from someone living here.

This storm was well modeled for days. However, local TV really down played it. Even as recent as Tuesday afternoon they were giving the impression that it would be an inch or two of snow despite models indicating much more snow and most importantly a bunch of ice. Last night they started to pick up on it, but left out the rather huge warning clues from NWS statements.

Now, two weeks ago there was a storm that was forecast to drop around 6 inches of snow. It ended up dropping about 2-3 inches instead. During this, the school district for the county Raleigh is located in canceled schools on a day where no precipitation fell at all. A lot of people made fun of this and then made fun of the fact they stayed closed for 4 total days.

Fast forward to today. The Wake county schools closed again, but in the AM there was no precipitation. It had been forecast to start around noon, so this was expected, but a lot of businesses gave the message of ""you need to be at work as usual"". Just after 12, the snow started falling in the area and in many places (including my parking lot at work), there was easily a half inch down in 10 minutes. 

The road crews had treated some of the major roads, but the fast rate of precipitation basically overtook the brine that was used. The feeder roads into those main roads were untreated.

Once people started to leave, everyone else felt the need to leave as well, and then here we are. The picture is ""funny"" because of the car fire, but the general reason for this was caused (IMHO) by local TV failing to take this seriously and the work-at-all-costs mentality of the area.

Anyway, have a laugh at us, but it's not as simple as people want to make it sound.

All these people are stuck on 440 and I'm just here snowboarding all over NCSU campus.I live in Raleigh. I was born in Philly, lived there as well as north and south NJ and Manhattan. I have been in, walked, played and driven in many snowstorms, blizzards and ice storms up there. I learned that snow down here is handled and experienced MUCH differently. When I moved here 5+ years ago I was managing a company. Snow was predicted for the next day (1 to 3 inches). Everyone was telling/asking (we are closed tomorrow right???). I was like ""Uhh... no. It is only 1 to 3 inches. This is nothing. You should plan to come into work tomorrow but be careful."" But to be safe I told them I would drive in first and then email everyone to let them know how it went. It snowed 1 to 3 inches the next morning. I drove in and then proceeded to call and email everyone.... ""DON'T COME IN!!!"" It was not just the snow that was the issue. It was the people driving and the sheet of ice that came with it as well. Holy Crap was it insane. I drove 5 miles and counted 7 accidents and many cars that just ran off the road. If snow comes in Raleigh... Shut it down! Shut it all down and lock yourselves inside! They don't have the infrastructure for it, the experience to drive in it or the cars conditioned to handle it. This is also the ""ice belt"" in the US. And ice, no matter where the hell you are, is impossible to drive on. I drove less than half a mile today after lunch in an AWD RAV4. Thing handled like a champ but it still took almost 30 minutes to get home. We were warned and prepared but it fell so fast today during lunch hour and nobody was expecting that. During the drive back I passed by another beast of a 4x4. This is what it looked like: http://i.imgur.com/9fV7WAT.jpg

Edit: spelling errorsI live near there. Even the Carolina vs. Duke game is being called off for this, and it's a pretty big rivalry.The fire in the background...

That's something you just can't make up.Yeah, Raleigh! Represent!Not Fred's Beds!

My life is fucking awesome.  So easy to bitch about the mundane.  The photograph comes from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.

Context: ""It is a scene of unimaginable desolation  a crowd of men, women and children stretching as far as the eye can see into the war-devastasted landscape of Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria. This was the queue for aid at a UNRWA distribution point in the capital, Damascus, on 31 January. The UN relief agency has distributed more than 7,000 food parcels in the Palestinian camp, home to about 160,000 people, since 18 January. The UN has reported infant malnutrition in the community, which has been reduced to eating animal feed. As of this week, all aid distributions have been suspended because of security concerns. Chris Gunness, a spokesperson, said UNRWA had received assurances that a deal allowing humanitarian access to Yarmouk would be implemented as soon as possible. He said: They have suffered enough.""Get this: you know how you think about 'ordinary people'? - people that have a life, have a family, have a house, have a job, have a drink? These were ordinary people. This was thrust upon them by armed factions and a government with an iron fist.

Here's Homs in [2011](http://imgur.com/zM5eHJd).

Here's Homs [now](http://imgur.com/ns7as51).

I know that a lot of people get this, but some people just don't seem to. They are overly partisan, they openly lie or spread rumours about either side, they care more about their ideal political system than people.

That's fucked. 

There is no difference between this and something like this happening in New York or Washington DC.Looks apocalyptic. what can we do to help?Just to clarify, Yarmouk Camp was established in 1957 for Palestinians fleeing Palestine/Israel. Before the Syrian Revolution, it was home to hundreds of thousands of Syrian Palestinians. 

Note the utter destruction: apartment blocks completely leveled. 

For some time now, in much of Damascus and elsewhere, the Syrian government has been implementing a ""siege"" strategy in which it incircles opposition sympathetic areas in an attempt to starve out fighters while also 'softening' targets through indiscriminate artillery barrage. 

The result is lines like this. Civilians pay a HUGE price. In fact, this is the point. By engaging in 'collective punishment' (explicitly against the Geneva conventions) the Syrian government wants to make it utterly unbearable for civilians to tolerate the presence of opposition fighters.

This unconscionable approach has been somewhat effective.  
I've followed this uprising and subsequent macabre conflict for 3 years now. One of the ways I try to block out the suffering is to tell myself these people are somehow different, that they're in a different country or a different circumstance

The reality is they aren't. They are suffering as much as you or I would in such a situation

They are caught in the middle of a meat-grinder - a dictator who won't (can't) quit now and an opposition who have become swollen with extremists who do not share the same ideals.. and are intent on turning Syria into the next Afghanistan

One military prison has produced over 10,000 bodies, many with eyes missing, and terrible damage - torture on an almost industrial scale

Politicians in Russia block UN consensus to stand by their ally, and politicians on the other side are haunted by the spectre of Iraq - powerless - all they can do is ""talk"" and throw money at the UNHCR to try to give aid to not thousands, but millions of refugees 

It's easy to criticise, many many good people on all levels, even the highest levels have tried desperately to stop this on a humanitarian level - but hasn't been enough, and we're left with another grim lesson like Rwanda

Whatever we say about our shitty governments, at least we had the opportunity to vote for them, not be saddled with dinosaur autocrats that rather see their country drown in blood before taking one step toward a genuine free/fair election

Very sad stuff
Man, do I take my quality of life for granted.I think I will live in gratitude today. Especially at mealtime. Why is it we hold memorial days for veterans but not the completely innocent victims of war?  There should be an international memorial day to remember all the people who would otherwise be forgotten because they *didn't* fight.  Iv'e been working on this idea for some time, if anyone's interested please message.  those poor soulsHere is a link to donate: [UNRWA Syrian Relief](http://www.unrwa.org/donate)ELI5, what's stopping global powers from coming in to deliver aid?Thats not a queue thats an exodus.This is really the first picture of Syria that has opened my eyes to the struggles they face over there. Stunning photography.When I'm hungry, I pick up the phone and call for delivery. Food in around 30-40 minutes and I'm good to go.

I couldn't begin to imagine not knowing when your next meal will be. Fuck.Wow. Pulitzer right there. Composition, lighting, perspective, not even speaking of dramatic content.

Just wow. I work in a clinic in Canada for newly arrived refugees.  It's unimaginable what these people have been through.  The composition of the photo is something to behold.  There are the obvious symbols:

* the huddled masses struggling to survive
* the war-torn building, nearly falling down on those waiting for sustenance.
* the anguish in so many faces

Then more specifically:

* the man in front is bowing his head as if to say, ""enough, I can't take any more.""
* the man in the glasses up close on the left could be your class mate or a bloke you see in the store.  
* in the middle right is a young boy in a baseball hat.  His Little League season could be starting next week.
* behind him in the distance is a haunting, dark silhouette as if death is queuing up with the hungry

This is easily one of the most haunting photos I've seen in recent memory.If you ever think that you have no reason to smile, realize that there are people in this picture smiling.

We have no context as to why they are smiling... but they are for one reason or another.

Find the good in everything.disgusting and shameful siege warfare on part of the Syrian Army is causing this horror. Palestinian refugees living in their formerly prosperous community have been greeted with rocket, artillery, and barrel bomb barrages while the military blocks all access to food or aid. Even with UN resolutions demanding access to areas like Yarmouk and Homs - they rely on the 'good will' of the parties involved. The ruined streets and buildings are indicative of the 'good will' shown by the SAA and its criminal militias These people had normal lives, normal jobs until one day everything changed. I feel so horrible. :(too much wealth in the world to accept this shit again tomorrowI meet each week with a Syrian refugee family as a volunteer conversation partner.  They were one of the lucky few chosen to get out of Syria and come to the U.S. last summer.  When I'm sitting there with their family, watching the teenage girls on their iPhones, giggling over the boys they have crushes on, complaining about their teachers, acting so typical of every other American teenager.... it's absolutely horrifying to think how close they came to living in the totally different reality shown in this picture.  It was just such a random stroke of luck that they were plucked out of that mess.  Just a random stroke of luck that they're in a cozy home watching Beyonce videos rather than freezing their asses off in a fucking food line.  Their lives here aren't easy, especially for the teenagers who are exhausted from learning English, have to deal with bullying at school, and miss their friends back home.  You can tell the kids are kind of naive to how bad it's gotten over there... but when they talk about missing Syria you look at their parents' faces and you just see this sort of shell-shocked look that says ""I can't believe we were lucky enough to get out of there... thank god my family is safe.""

The camshaft was really soft, check it and replace with a harder one as necessary. They are fun cars! Oh, and another thing, compared to modern cars, the brakes sucked!

I would highly recommend going on the car and pulling the carpet and check the Floor Panels for rust and treat it...Also under the battery tray is usually a good spot to look for rust

First thing I would do tho is upgrade most of the bushing to Urethane since if they haven't already your cars are all rotted...almost 40year old rubber.

If you have the cash get new struts and springs while your at it, if it hasn't been done already...Hope it's a stickGood luck, that poor thing is going to break down on you so much, and the parts are soooo expensive.

I'm sure you'll do just fine though.

Why does no one see this?I love it""And that, my son, is the story of how we traded with the white man, and got a baseball bat in exchange for a bow, an arrow and Botswana.""I bet we're going to see some mature and thought provoking comments here.

/sI like that you can see how confident and grown up each of the boys looks with their own weapon juxtapositioned with their incompetence and childishness when faced with learning the other cultures weapon.  Funny how kindness never really reciprocated from the European colonialists. anyone know if either of these boys are still alive? would be an interesting ama if we could track one of them downI love how innocent and open it all seems. It's like, 

""Wow, this thing is pretty cool! how do you use it? Ok, so I plant my feet like this, and draw back like so? That was pretty nifty! Say, you wanna play baseball with me? You don't know baseball!? it's only the greatest game ever! let me show you"" 

and all 

""You have to point your hips and your leading toe at the thing you want to shoot. Now pull the string back to your ear. Perfect! Now, point the arrow at the wild beast, and let it go! Baseball? I've never heard of it. The greatest game ever? I'd love to learn! So I gab the bat like so?""

Just like making friends at the park.

Of course, white boy may just be trading his knowledge of America's favorite pastime in exchange for bow lessons so that he can murder people and blame it one the tribe, but I try to be an optimist And that's how Africa became such a power in baseball, dominating the sport over traditional powers, USA and Japan.

That's why the sport was removed from the Olympics. The looks on the kids' faces while their teaching each other is incredible.""There are plenty of sticks around here asshole, give me my bow back!""Beautiful ""Try to run to home.""

If you scan these type of films today, you still get better quality than the digitals of today. 48 StarsThis was because it was shot on a large format camera (most likely a 4x5), and at a very low aperture (granting sharp focus all over the image, instead of in a single area) from cameras that had completely manual controls and high quality glass. This was also most likely on positive film (think of slide film) as opposed to color negative film (the kind you see color photos printed on), as the technology for the latter was either highly experimental or just hadn't been created yet. This is also why people mistakenly believe that there were no color photographs from this era; [color film was produced as early as 1902](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_motion_picture_film) but professional photographers thought it was a gimmick (and color film was also incredibly limited and expensive)  and would rather use the black and white film they could actually print from. 

When the US government contracted famous photographers from that day to take photographs for the Farm Security Administration, what resulted were all these masterful black and white photographers going out and creating the iconic Great Depression photos most of you have seen countless times. What is lesser known is that the US Government would provide and also try to get these photographers to use the more experimental color film at the time, which many were reluctant to use, and resulted in gorgeous, jewel-like color slides that were filed away and later discovered by archivists and the like. 

TL/DR: Color film has existed since the early 1900's and the reason they look so good today is that those color images were shot by photographic masters who were accustomed to making high quality black and white negatives for printing. 
I always picture the past in sort of a grainy, low-pixel imagery due to the level of camera technologies. I love these sorts of pictures because it gives me a clearer view of the pastThis is from 1911:

We are just now catching up on film vs. digital quality. pretty incredible if you ask me!Most likely taken on a 4x5 sheet film camera, such as a speed graphic. 4x5 cameras are still in use by professionals today, including myself. A drum scanned 4x5 negative has as much image detail and resolution as a $50,000 - $100,000 digital medium format camera, such as a hasselblad/phase-one/mamiya/leaf.

[Lady in the Water](http://imgur.com/DXRmvLs)

An awesome photo that would probably win awards today, but it's actually from 1947. CRAZY.These are 4x5 Kodachromes.  They get rediscovered every now and then.  Here are some more, posted this week on photo.net:
http://pavel-kosenko.livejournal.com/303194.html?thread=22669914But their faces are always blurred. Why cant I see my ancestors. *why.*It's probably taken on Kodachrome film.  Nothing better for preserving color fidelity over the years, and producing a photo with the least possible grain.

It's a shame no one can develop Kodachrome slide film any more.

Kodak introduced Ektachrome slide film that used stadard C-41 film processing (the same as 35mm color film), and photographers still used Kodachrome, because it produced virtually grain free slides and photos.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KodachromeVery cool pic! Thanks for sharing.High quality photos of the past look futuristic...Film is amazing. It was harder to work with, not very convenient, expensive. But they were doing things with film (and other sorts of analog technologies) that digital still struggles to catch up with.

I believe that eventually there will be a resurgence of analog technology eventually.

EDIT: eventually.Mama don't take my Kodachrome away.

Well played.Wow that was quickOverall, I say the Sochi Olympics was fantastic despite the negativity prior. Gives me hope for the WC in Russia in 201810/10. I like a good sense of humor. I would like to buy a drink for whoever thought that up.As an American who has been living in Russia for 5+ years I can tell you in some ways Russians are just like every person in the planet but in some things they do things that uniquely Russian. One which is that Russians are masters of deadpan, self deprecating, cynical and dark humor. Their humor is often far more subtle and what we are used to. Once you understand that aspect of Russian society you will quickly realize that humor is actually a much more larger part in normal life in Russia than it is in the US and western Europe. 

Below is an example of Russian humor.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were going camping. They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: ""Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you see."" Watson replied: ""I see millions and millions of stars."" Holmes said: ""And what do you deduce from that?"" Watson replied: ""Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, its quite likely there are some planets like Earth out there. And if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life."" And Holmes said: ""Watson, you idiot, it means that somebody stole our tent.""Good for them. No one really thinks less of them for it in the first place, I, for one, think higher of them for poking fun at this non-issue.What's going on?THEY PLANNED IT THE WHOLE TIME

THEY JIMMY KIMMEL'D USYup, if there's something Russia's known for, it's laughing at its own mistakes.[deleted]As an American, I really love Russia. I know that my parent's generation was taught to fear them, but they never passed it on. I'm grateful.

(I was interviewed by Krakauer for the book.) To this day, I have trouble believing the person I knew is the same person who suffered this fate. 

He was my editorial page editor - a position I promoted him into after I had to fire his predecessor. And he was a damned good one. Incredibly smart. Very focused. And someone who wanted to do a good job. He wasn't overly social with the rest of us, but was always friendly and usually had a smile on his face. His interests at the time were in politics - and there was no hint of the tidal personality shift that would later come. Beautiful story, that boy. Stupid, but beautiful.Many of you are missing an important distinction.  ""Alexander Super-Tramp"" was not an idiot---he was ignorant.  

He shunned helped and traditional wisdom on purpose, aware of the inherent risks.  He died as a result.  I would wager he did not intend to become a cultural phenom, and would have agreed with almost all of us, that his death was his own damn fault.  


Alexander Supertramp! ...Aaaand I have an Eddie Vedder song in my head.TIL every Redditor is smarter than Christopher McCandless. When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he [had] had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament. Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.""


If you've read the book, I think you'd agree McCandless felt like he'd already lived out his life in Western civilisation and ventured into the wild completely unequipped to let nature take him. I think he intended to last a lot longer than he did and I wouldn't be surprised if once he got ill he regretted his lack of equipement but at the same time I always felt that he went out there to die. I don't think calling him an idiot accurately sums it up. I watched that movie not realizing it was a true story.  Until the final credits when the photos started.  /gobsmacked.Suddenly everyone on Reddit is survivor man. I've actually hiked out to that bus. Here's proof:

Nice photo. For anyone interested in more backstory: check out the documentary ""[The Call of the Wild](http://www.tifilms.com/wild/call_intro.htm)"".My friend's mother went to prom with Chris McCandliss.Love that movie and book, where in Alaska is this?
I feel bad for Chris's family and friends. Other than that I always felt like he died for nothingI read about chris in a writers magazine in 7th grade. It was a middle school magazine for english classes and when it was downtime I used to read the back issues. I read the whole story in one sitting and it really stuck with me. It had excerpts from his journal and photos from inside the bus, even the damn sleeping bag he was in when they found him. It really haunted me like I couldn't forget it and thought about it often because his journal was so sad. Years later my brother in law mentioned they seen a movie about a guy's life and how he died in a bus in the middle of nowhere.   I haven't watched the movie since I heard about it and I don't want to. It's really sad where some human beings find themselves and I think he knew what he was doing but when he tried to change his mind he couldn't because he was so weak. Don't ever read the journal it's heartwrenching.Seems to me that McCandless idolized Thoreau for his Walden experience, but failed to fully read Walden--never internalizing/realizing the proximity to town Thoreau kept for all 2 years, 2 months and 2 days. Thoreau was well-trained for every aspect but McCandless was only well-trained in the idealism/""romanticism"" of the experience, not in the application.[This guy] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Proenneke) is the anti-McCandless.

I get sucked into the show every time my local PBS station re-airs it during pledge season.A thought -

To those above who criticise the idea of trial by fire, it may be that it takes a very particular type of middle class yuppie to 'get' why you'd want to do trial by fire, but I totally do.

Everyone who met McCandless seemed charmed by him, to an almost unnatural degree. Having things come easy to you like that all the time is unsettling, and it makes you want to push back, and do something that you know people WON'T like.

There's also the fact that Thoreau and such didn't have honed survival skills - they learnt on the job, and the idea of harking back to that time is appealing to a certain type of character. Doing otherwise feels like 'cheating'.

Sure, a lot of people criticise McCandless' actions but I spent most of the book unsettled by how much he reminded me of myself - stubborn, headstrong, undoubtedly tinged with waves of inferiority and self aggrandisement to the extent that it resembles mental illness.

I have a LOT of admiration for McCandless, and I see a certain quiet nobility in his death - he didn't ask for the ensuing media storm, in fact it's probably the exact opposite of what he would've wanted.

As someone who thinks camping is 'roughing it', I hope I find the courage to do something as brave and crazy one day. Hopefully with less death.

Also, yep, the dude's teeth are SUPER white. Glad I'm not alone in noticing that.I worked in Alaska this past summer and lived in a cabin out Stampede Road not 5 miles from that fucking bus. Native Alaskans think CM is a fucking retard. FYI.I haven't read the book, so I don't know what his intents were, but how long was he expecting to stay out there? Was it just like a short term survivalist adventure? Or was he planning on living out there 'off the land' on his own for the rest of forever?

It just seems like a overly romanticized view of a 'primitive' lifestyle. Like he thought, ""oh if the native americans could do it, so could I!""

I've watched it like five times.Would I be right in saying the outer layer is to make them quieter? I swear they took huge influence from the barn owl with that design, or I at least saw something which stated that barn owls are almost silent when they fly because of the way in which their feathers are layered on their body? 

Edit: Kind of the same concept with how those big fluffy things on microphones work.

pls respond[I took a bunch of pics of the DreamLifter yesterday](http://imgur.com/a/8vkvx), if anyone's interested. That plane doesn't have these new designs and holy cow was it loud! It sounded like a rocket, you could feel the sound waves in the chest. Marie would LOVE these!Love that you guys all have *engineering boners* right now, but I see things a little differently. And by that I mean...[this](http://i.imgur.com/UmA82b5.jpg) Are these the new GEnx engines? I really want to peel the plastic off them.So, a typical jet engine works as follows: air enters the engine through a compressor located in the front of the engine. The compressor will increase the air pressure, once out of the compressor the compressed air is mixed with fuel injected into the combustion chamber located in the middle of the engine just above the rotating shaft, then this mixture goes into a turbine located in the back of the engine. The turbine reduces the pressure of the mixture but not as low as that of the surrounding athmosphere, this mixture is then exhausted and white vapor trails will form depending on the moisture. This is where the noise comes from, the shear stress of the exhaust gas against the surrounding athmosphere. Newer jet engies, which is what I'm going to talk about, reduce that shear stress. ""High bypass"" engine means that, after going through the large fan in front of the engine, the ratio of air mass going into the compressor to air mass flowing around the main body of the engine is high. A typical bypass ratio for a General Electric CF6 engine which powers widebodies such as the Boeing 767, the DC-10 and the Airbus A300/A310 is about 5 to 1 or 6 to 1, that means that for every unit mass of air entering the compressor, the mass of air bypassed is five or six times greater. The purpose of designing jet engines with larger cowlings is to reduce the shear stress of the flowing air against the surrounding athmosphere, thus reducing the noise. This is why the Pratt & Whitney JT 3D, 8D and 9D engines which power older Boeing aircrafts such as the 707, 727 and 747-100 respectively are so noisy, that's because the shear stress of exhaust air against the surrounding air is high since there is no air bypassed. One of the great technologies about the Boeing 777 is the high bypass ratio engines, the ratio is 8 to 1 or even 9 to 1 for all three engine types offered, GE-90, PW-4000 and RR Trent 800. This explains why the 777 is so quiet, the exhaust air has almost no shear stress against the surroundings. CFM engines which power the new Boeing 737's, Airbus A320 and A340 are also designed with a high bypass ratio. If you see a large cowling around the main body of the engine, then you know it has a high bypass ratio. If you don't see one, it may or may not have a high bypass ratio depending on whether the engine is thin or not. Engines such as the RR-RB211 or CFM-56 which power the Boeing 757/747-400 or the Airbus A340 respectively don't have an extra cowling but it is noticeable that they are silent because they are wide, the 1st stage fan is much larger than the 2nd stage compressor.

NOW 

what the triangle things do is FURTHER reduce the air differential from the exhaust/bypass ratio into the outside environment by 'mixing' some of it in to the stream...in a sense, you are creating even more 'pseudo-bypass' air in the rear of the engine. This helps reduce noise..albeit by only a little. hope this helps!!!Does it come with purple undercarriage lights, like the car I bought when I was 18?Only 1 step away from Pod Racing now.I didn't know that Boeing was entering for pod racing.As a kid, I thought some big ass muscular dude (brothers watched WWF) was in the belly of the plane and had two straws that he drank the fuel from as he cranked the engines manually to spin them.Megaman's poor arms...","{'Openness': 0.682, 'Analytical': 0.198, 'Sadness': 0.086203, 'Anger': 0.847016, 'Extraversion': 0.313, 'Joy': 0.042418, 'Agreeableness': 0.242, 'Emotional_Range': 0.604, 'Tentative': 0.851, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.131905, 'Fear': 0.072186, 'Conscientiousness': 0.332}","{'motorcycle': 0.942676, 'vehicle': 0.942676}"

Story about this photo:

> After spending a week photographing various areas of the Canadian Rockies, photographer Brian Donovan decided he wanted to focus on getting some interesting train shots against the wintry backdrop. Dovan shared that over the course of two days he endured nearly 13 hours of sitting by the train tracks, where he saw only 6 trains coming from the wrong (less scenic) direction. As the weather rapidly changed from better to worse a final train came roaring around the bend. Donovan quickly setup and captured the engine as it neared and then adjusted for a long exposure of the boxcars rushing by. The train was loaded with several long segments of different colored boxcars, each giving the shot a unique feel, but the red boxcars instantly stood out, resulting in the amazing image you see here.Why have I never seen this done before? It seems so obvious.  Awesome shot.That is a picture of the flash.Tron TrainI've been there!

[a wild pokemon has appeared](http://imgur.com/WV7fdSZ)[that's no train](http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120812051806/spongebob/images/3/34/Sandy_spongebob_and_the_worm.jpg)Government coverup. Actually a high-speed photo of the Flash.How come the clouds appear static but the train is moving? Whhat sort of shutter spped do you imagine?Hey y'all. Here's how Brian would have taken this shot:  

First, he had a lens with focal length of about 35mm on full frame. Compare with [this photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/markblumm/10218371523/meta/) taken on a crop sensor which has an effective focal length of about 60mm.

Taking a photo in bright light like this, the camera would be set to ISO100, F/5.6 for good sharpness, and a shutter speed of around 1/1000. But getting good motion blur on a train means a shutter speed of around 5 seconds, like in [this long exposure](http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahbarnes/7282676596/sizes/l/) which I took myself. The difference between 1/1000 and 5 seconds is 12 1/3 stops, but seeing as the foreground is a bit dimmer than the sky Brian probably could have gotten away with a 10 stop Neutral Density filter. 

The photo has also been blended together from two different shots: one of the background with a fast shutter speed, and one of the foreground with a slower shutter speed. The exposures would have been separated just above the top of the train, [like so](http://i.imgur.com/1RlMhtN.jpg). This is particularly obvious because the ND filter has left a purple cast in the foreground of the image. That's not hard to fix, and I'm a bit surprised Brian didn't correct it himself. I did it for him in Photoshop and you can compare the before and after [here](http://i.imgur.com/eZyxLY8.jpg).

TLDR: Focal length 35mm, Background ISO100 F/5.6 1/1000s, Foreground ISO100 F/5.6 5s ND10. There's nothing complicated about even the best photos.

that's actually fantastic ""I said eggnog, not engage."" Since there are a lot of questions regarding the picture here is what i used. Canon T3i, f/7.1, ISO 100, 1.6 second exposure. I used an 18-55mm lens and snapped the zoom out right after hitting the shutterWhat's crazy is that somebody out there could take those vectors and return with exactly how your camera was positioned and how your hand shook during the zooming.Entering the Christmas Tree Galaxy.

Intro:

Under California law, it's legal to grow marijuana for medicinal purposes if you have a doctor's recommendation. A few years ago, Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman was trying to find a way to deal with the proliferation of marijuana in his county. Allman wanted to spend less time dealing with growers who were growing small, legal amounts, so he could focus on other problems  including criminals who run massive marijuana farms in the Mendocino National Forest. So he came up with a plan to allow the small farmers to grow, if they registered with his office. Growers would pay for little zip-ties they could put around the base of their marijuana plants, and the cops would know to leave them alone. It saved time and generated revenue. Reporter Mary Cuddehe tells the story of how the county and the nation responded to the sheriff's plan. (18 minutes)Drugs  Legal System

Berlin at night

This picture was taken by ESA astronaut André Kuipers from the International
Space Station (ISS) and was first shown at the ISS Symposium 2012 in Berlin.

The former division between East and West Berlin can be seen. The yellow
lights correspond to East Berlin and the greener tones show West Berlin. Over
20 years since the Berlin Wall was dismantled the effects of separating the
city can still be seen from space.

The picture was taken using a new camera aid called NightPod. Nightpod tracks
the Earth automatically as it moves below the Space Station resulting in
images that are sharper and have more detail.

This orangered/periwinkle conflict has deeper roots than I thought.It almost looks like half the city uses Fl.ux and the other doesn't.A question about the split of Germany and Berlin during the Cold War that I've always wanted to know but just haven't asked:

How did German citizens go back and forth between West Germany and West Berlin? The city of Berlin was situated well within the bounds of East Germany, so what travel/trade routes were available between the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall?I love Berlin. I have been nowhere else like it. I love how the scars of history shape the city. It's gritty, real, and cool. It may not be as romantic as Paris or Rome, but it is without a doubt German in the best way possible. I love lamp. I lived in East Berlin for a year as an exchange student (Central, but still East). It's noticable that the street lights are another color, but there's plenty of it. 

Also, it's an amazing city with breathing room in more senses than one; it was built for five million people, but only 3,5m live there. And there's an extremely high tolerance for other subcultures. Not in the clammy embracing way that some Western cities absorb their subcultures (thereby diluting and obscuring them), but in a genuinely, tolerant 'you-do-your-thing-and-I-do-mine-and-it's-okay' way.  [North/South Korea divide still visible from space due to  O__O](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/12/19/C0044096-Korea_at_night,_satellite_image-SPL.jpg)This looks like my wife's iPhone after she dropped it.As someone who is colorblind, I'm lost.Thought I would add to this that on the streets of Berlin, you can also tell if you're in the East or West by the crosswalk signals at intersections. The west side has similar ones to the stick figure men, while the east side has a dude wearing a fedora.Those are some long-lasting light bulbs.Very interesting, I'm doing a History Paper on the Korean DMZ and the Inner German Border, I'm going put this on the cover sheet. :)here is an interesting direct source of the different lamps used in the city of berlin:
 
http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/beleuchtung/de/gaslicht/faq.shtml. 

it's unfortunately in german only (at least i can't find the english page to it), but in this FAQ the development authorities of berlin thoroughly explain that the older, less efficient and more expensive gas lamps are recently replaced in different phases, mainly in the western ""erschliessungsstrassen"", which is a term for the less frequently used streets leading to the main traffic arteries.

 i.e. this involves a lot of street work, so it's done gradually and often in combination with other street maintenance work all over the place.

furthermore, there is obviously concern of the berlin population that the design of the old lamps (which look more nostalgic and ""nice"" than the modern electric lamps) will be lost in this process. this is answered with the fact that most old design street lamps have NOT been replaced in their design but rather changed from gas to LED electric usage within the same, old street lamp design (an example, taken from kreuzberg in the WESTERN part of the city) is shown here: http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/beleuchtung/de/gaslicht/aufsatz_umruestung.shtml) - obviously under consideration of the warm, less ""cooling"" light that modern LED lamps are able to provide.

i think the whole idea of an east/west divide in the lamp light quality of the city even after 20 years of reunion is just an illusion we WANT to see, because it's so nicely a sensation example for a picture taken from the sky. it says more about our fantasies but doesn't hold up to the actual facts of reality down there on the ground - anyone living in the city or visiting it will not find east/west divide in street lighting in the city.Are you saying that Obama could cure our light bulb problem with Communism?East Berlin is best Berlin?What is the difference between the light bulbs?

Any of you seen Rambo III?

http://neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=456340


Anyone who has seen this film particularly within the last decade will have probably noticed what seemingly must be a 'strange' attitude towards the Afghan fighters, or specifically the Mujahideen fighting ""the foreign invasion"". This scene encapsulates this point:

Watch

The irony was not lost on the studio/distributor. Here's a quick movia trivia:
The movie ends with two quotes: ""This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan."" and ""I am like a bullet, filled with lead and made to kill"" However, this was a not the original quote in the movie. Prior to the American war in Afghanistan, the ending quote of the movie read **""This film is dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan**"". This was then edited to read ""people of Afghanistan"" during the post 9/11 era.Osama Bin Laden's recruiting organisation for the Mujahedeen (MAK) was funded by Saudi Arabia and Pakinstan (he did not receive funds from Operation Cyclone, the CIA's funding operation for the Mujahedeen) during the Soviet-Afghan War. This actually became the foundation of his funding and recruiting network for Al-Qaeda.

This is 1993, so four years since the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan and three years before his first Fatwa against the United States. The FBI didn't even open a file on him until that Fatwa, and even then they mostly just considered him a potential funder of terrorism. Seems strange to read, but with the information the Independent would have had, they would have little basis to link him to terrorist activities. 

If anyone's interested in finding more about the history of this, I can't recommend Lawrence Wrights 'The Looming Tower' or 'Ghost Wars' by Steve Coll enough. 

EDIT: This was only intended to contextualise the article with a very, very shallow view of the history of this topic. I tried to keep things based in what are 'known knowns', and even then, some would contest me saying Operation Cyclone did not fund Bin Laden. I am not saying what I wrote is definitive, but I hope it provides a little insight. I strongly believe in Chomsky and his 1991 assertion that a decent proportion of 'Terrorology' acts almost as propaganda to maintain the pejorative nature of the term 'terrorism', rather than it being constructive analysis and discussion of the issues we face. I implore anyone who is interested to read on the topic and make up your own mind. There's some very interesting comments in /r/askhistorians around the collapse of the Ottoman Empire onwards and how it's relevant to Middle Eastern politics and the rise of extremism. Remember, Islamic extremism is a relatively new phenomena which, personally, I would date back to the Seige of Mecca in 1979. Again, this depends on your interpretation.


[Yesterdays warriors, todays terrorists.... yesterdays terrorists, todays warrirors](http://newmexicomercury.com/el_macheteMandela-1.gif)Robert Fisk interviewed Osama Bin Laden on three separate occasions. He wrote about them in a wonderful piece from his incredibly fascinating book, ""The Great War for Civilization: The Conquest of the Middle East."" The one thing that will stay with me whenever this sort of stuff is brought up is when the Taliban took Kabul from Massoud in 1996.

There was little mention of it anywhere in the news, the only one BBC reporter via sat phone from Pakistan. Here is a countries capital falling yet no-one even cares to send a news crew.Syria = Afghanistan 2.0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(intelligence)This is a ridiculous equivocation.

When they were fighting in Afghanistan, it was against an invading army, hitting military targets. They weren't going after civilians or anything like that.

""Terrorism"" is making the population fear what you can do and using that fear to accomplish your goals. Once they started attacking civilian targets and using violence to incite fear to affect American foreign policy, *then* they became terrorists. 

tl;dr: Terrorism is about what methods you're using, not what your organization is.Same with the KLA (UCK) in Kosovo, just reversed...Keep this in mind the next time some ass hat lobbies to arm jihadis in Syria [deleted]So are we at war with Eurasia or East Asia?It goes the other way around too. [Here is Menachem Begin wanted by British authorities for blowing up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem](http://i.imgur.com/EmploNm.jpg). He later went on to become Israel's 6th prime minister.http://imgur.com/52Clfw7

This is Danish politician Lars Løkke Rasmussen visiting anti-Soviet heroes in Afghanistan 1988 to personally hand over a large cash donation to them.

He later went on to become the Prime Minister of Denmark  and in charge of the Danish military fighting those same Taliban guys in Afghanistan.

Oh how the times change..I think he's just today's dead guy at the bottom of the ocean. During the anti-Soviet jihad Bin Laden and his fighters received American and Saudi funding. Some analysts believe Bin Laden himself had [security training](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm) from the CIA.

CIA funding flowed to mujahideen via Pakistan, which fanned the flames of militancy to keep its influence in Afghanistan, and also use these elements against its fight with India. 

These very forces were cause celebre to defeat the Russia, but once the funding dried up these elements had nothing to do. The nexus between Pakistan ISI and Taliban is well documented. The handlers ultimately failed to handle these extremists and now the dance with the devil is affecting Pakistan as well, among others.

Highly recommend reading this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Taliban-Militant-Fundamentalism-Central-Edition/dp/0300163681) on Taliban.Link to the article on The Independent's website - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/antisoviet-warrior-puts-his-army-on-the-road-to-peace-the-saudi-businessman-who-recruited-mujahedin-now-uses-them-for-largescale-building-projects-in-sudan-robert-fisk-met-him-in-almatig-1465715.htmlAh, Britain. In March 1993 the New York Times wasn't describing him flatteringly.

>Yemeni officials contend that Afghanistan veterans in Yemen, financed by Osama Binladen [sic], a wealthy Saudi militant and former Afghan guerrilla now living in Khartoum, Sudan, have been behind a series of attacks, including two bombs in Aden hotels last year that killed an Australian tourist.

This is not one of those occasions. Your Father made a split second decision to help a friend, knowing full well the implications of how it would affect his life, very few people are capable of that. I don't think I am. hugs to your dad!Your Dad's burns look like the ones my Dad sustained back in the '30s. He was plowing a field with a tractor and splashed some gas on its hot manifold when he refueled it. About 40% of his body was first-degree burns. The hospital sent him home to die--well, actually to live, maybe. They said if he stayed in the hospital he'd absolutely get infected and die; if he went home, there was a small possibility he'd live. He survived, but his burn scars looked a lot like your Dad's.I'm glad people like that exist in this world. I hope he enjoys his day today! Person with burn marks

/r/no_sob_story I'm confused. Why was he unable to roll? How do you roll on top of someone in a way that extinguishes fire? your dad is bad ass hope he enjoys fathers day!Your father really is a hero, that's so freakin cool! Give him a happy Father's Day from me and a hi five for just being awesome!Props to PopsYour dad is awesome!You have an awesome father!

Salutes to him!Is the little person in bed behind him you as a toddler?Why does the burn on his arm end so suddenly? Is it just because his shirt was on or did he have special clothes on?Your dad is awesome. Point blank.Was this gas plant fire in the Houston area? I have a question, did you inherit your Dad's massive testicles?9 month recovery, for those burns? My legs were wrecked, I have skin grafts, and I only spent about 5ish months in recovery, and only a month was in the hospital. What degree were the burns?

Edit* Spellingunable to roll...  what a square. He had short sleved FRCs? I guess that explains why we aren't allowed to wear them. Even when it is 90 degrees.I spent three -weeks- in the hospital and my mind started going.

Is this at the NY Public Library exhibit?I actually just posted this in another thread but Winnie the Pooh wasn't based on this bear at all. This is Christopher Robins bear I think but the bear the originally images of Pooh come from was another bear I think called Growler. Who I believe was E.H. Shephard's son's bear. Also interestingly enough Christopher Robins image isn't based on Christopher Robin it's based on Shephard's son Graham. 

This came out in someone's memoir but I forget who's (I was listening to a dramatisation of it on BBC Radio 4)

Edit: Here's a source where it confirms the original inspiration for the bear was in fact Graham's bear called Growler. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4772370.stm)
What da fuck is the one in the top left? That ain't natural!The only Winnie-the-Pooh thing I own is the original VHS tape from before Disney bought it and these are featured in it. If you have not seen it, it is really wonderful, and blends the book into the story beautifully. Didnt the author originally get the idea from a Canadian soldiers pet bear in ww1. The bear was named Winnie after the soldier's home Winnipeg. i feel sad. 

like at the end of Toy Story 3. 

god damn emotions. Must've had a big imagination for character development.My dad used to read the stories of Pooh bear to me when I was a small sprogling.

It's over 100 miles away...hope that guy (or his family, I suppose) doesn't need the card yet.My house used to sit right in the middle of that. I posted in the last thread that this got brought up in, but just for reference this is my drive way http://imgur.com/tpkIuEO. (my moms car included) This looks exactly like it does in Sim City. I always wanted our area to be on the front page for something.. but not this.  Never this.This is my town. We live about 3 miles away from this subdivision. It also hit a street about 2 blocks away. There are about 500 houses destroyed. The cloud came over our backyard but didn't touch down. All the schools are closed, some are being used as shelters. The storm hit 3 other surrounding towns within about  20 miles . There were about 8 different touchdowns in my area within a half an hour. There are multiple families, teachers & principles in the 3 districts who have nothing to come home too. Many residents have no power even if they still have homes. National Guard is here setting a curfew for 6pm-7pm. People are only allowed in if they show residency. Today they haven't let anyone back into town even f you live in the area. However, donations are flooding in & houses are being offered up. We live in a great, & strong community with wonderful people. We will rebuild!
TL;DR WASHINGTON STRONGThe most depressing thing about this kind of damage is the out of season storm.  There's barely time to clean up before the worst of winter hits.  let alone rebuild.  I was repairing a roof today that got smashed by a tree and it took 4 times longer than it normally should have with the wind and the sleet.  I was on tour with my band going through Peoria (right outside of Washington) when the storm hit. We were driving a suburban with a trailer and caught the beginning of the storm. One of the tornados swept across the interstate, picked up our car and rotated it three times. While in mid air, all of the windows shattered and the glass flew in at us with a combination of whatever else was in the air. Our trailer rolled over and we were pulled back to the ground. There were seven of us in the car and none of us were hurt more so than mild scratches and a few cuts. 

I have no idea how we lived through it. Most terrifying moment of my life. 

This is the second time I have ever posted on Reddit, so I'm not sure how to post links. But the LA times interviewed us and a story is online. CBS did as well and the video can be found. 

There is more to the story, but I am finally home in Memphis, Tennessee  and want to kiss the ground and be thankful that I have a home to come to. Go hug your friends and family. I realized today that I should never take the people in my life for granted. In a minute, they could be gone. The news is touting the 6 year old that begged his family into the basement as a hero, that may be, but no one is talking about how wreckless and negligent his mother is. She, her sister, and another kid refused to take cover in the basement until the kid was screaming and pleading for them to please take cover and they finally got fed up and did it to shut him up. The entire house was destroyed moments later. You could say the 6 year old is a hero, but what's sad is he was the most mature person in the home. The mother almost killed the entire family out of lazyness. What a terrible person, she should lose those kids.It's so bizarre seeing the neighborhood I grew up in A.) in that state and B.) getting this much international coverage.Its crazy to see something in my neck of the woods pop up on here. Its a mess here  I heard that the ""Welcome to Washington"" sign got sucked up, and they found it all the way in Streator. 52 miles away.Is it actually possible and affordible to build something tornadesafe? Or are tornados just too strong?This is my hometown, incredibly, only one person died. Estimated 250-500 houses are inhabitable.This is just crazy. That's my hometown. All my friends, coworkers...homes are just gone. I have electricity (as of a few hours ago anyhow), running water, food-- what do they have?


God, I feel so unreasonably guilty.All that is left is a shitload of fuck. 

Damn. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, and fuck you.

What is crazy is that I moved TO Washington il the day this happened. I was moving into my So'S parents house to save money. I lived about 2.5 hours south, the tornado struck while we were driving- but we had no idea. We had to drive separate and the weather was bad so I never checked my phone. When we got closer to town I was thinking to my self- man theses roads are really busy, shouldn't they all be in church? - we came in the back way so we didn't see anything driving in. We pull up to my bf house and his neighbors are outside and some of them were crying. His mom was out side on the phone freaking out because her calls were not going thru. sirens were going off and everything was so chaotic. It was so surreal.

I had the opportunity to visit the Anne Frank house last year. It was the most reverent place I've ever been. A large rowdy crowd before going in, and instantly quiet and somber once inside. It was an incredible experience. 

Edit: I want to add, the hiding spot was not so much if an attic as we think of it. IIRC, there was a main bedroom, a wide hallway that acted as a bedroom, a bathroom, a large kitchen/dining area, and an attic as we imagine it. The toilet was even plumbed and flushable. I'm not at all trying to say it was a pleasurable place (especially with 8 people), but its interesting to see what it is compared to what is imagined. I simply can't fathom how he must feel returning back to that place.He remarried. I was afraid he would just be lonely and sad.Not to take away from the atrocity, but those are damn high ceilings for an attic.The weight of the world is on his shoulders in that photo. In the photo in his [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Frank), I find the utter sadness in his eyes devastating.I'm currently in Amsterdam and I just visited the museum today. 

You can't leave there without tearing up. The fact that Otto lost his wife and both his daughters and survived the death camps...it's just too much. He made it his life's work to make sure Anne's diary got exposure. 

One of the saddest parts of seeing the house is you see the room Anne lived in and shared. It's tiny. She made it her own by pasting up pictures of her favorite movie stars and clippings. It really hits you that she was just an adolescent kid put in overwhelming circumstances. And the fact that all of this happened less than 70 years ago...it's almost too much for your mind to comprehend and it makes you hate everything the nazis stood for that much more. 

This photo conveys a deep sadness I hope I never have to feel ever in my life. How did she die?Having been there, what a beautiful depiction of the power of that place.  A must see for anyone.The Independent [wrote an article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-things-that-anne-was-really-frank-about-1359567.html) about how Otto had edited Anne's diary before publication.  A new, more complete diary, has recently been released by a surviving relative. No one can rightfully blame a father for wanting his daughter to be percieved as a ""good girl"" by the world. However, one can make the arguement that an honest representation of Anne would reveal a greater truth about the life she led, and would be of greater value as a piece of literature.  What do you think? Is it more important that Anne Frank should be immortalized as a symbol of human determination. Or is her story more valuable as a true representation of one Jewish girl's experience surviving Nazi occupation?

edit: a wordDid the scumbag neighbor ever come forward or were they ever identified? I hope they lived a long and miserable life knowing they killed a child by proxy. I hope their children and grandchildren had to read Frank's diary, then talked shit on the low life piece of shit that turned them in.""One day, Justin Bieber will come here and make all this suffering worthwhile,"" said Otto, lost in thought.Pretty ironic that I'm reading Anne Frank Remembered right now, which is Miep Gies' autobiography explaining what everything was like helping the Franks hide from the Germans. Really interesting book, and I'm glad I picked it for my book report. I personally find it fascinating to think about how this was all so recent. Poor Mr. Frank. :/[deleted]If anyone sees this post and you end up in Amsterdam, go to the Anne Frank museum!!! Ignoring places like the London Natural History Museum (and all natural history museums) it is one of the best museums in the world.

An absolutely fantastic and humbling experience, get in line an hour before it opens though because even at opening time in summer you'll have to wait an hour and half to get in (I learnt the hard way).I had no idea that this picture existed, but it moves me beyond words, especially when I see the height markings the children left on that post.I know this photo. It was shown to us in one of my photo classes back in college. I wish I could remember who took it, but I know it was someone famous. If I remember correctly, they went there to do a portrait and this photo was taken while Otto thought the photographer was setting up. This photo was snapped and the photographer just said ""ok, i'm done"". One frame. simple as that.

I'm sure i'm a little off and maybe someone will correct me or add to the story.This picture makes me weep.  I can't even put my emotions into words.  Some rare pictures of Anne. 

http://imgur.com/a/V6eup#0There is a sadness, and a kind of hollowness in this photo.  But those fuckers didnt kill you, Mr. Frank.  Your name and your line will live on.  You won.I wrote this in 7th grade: 

Ode to Otto

Tough decisions he must make

Peoples' lives in his wake

In hiding, he must

Gain his family's trust

The entire world remembers Anne

But, she didn't know the plan

He was very wise

To have such a disguise

But he was found

His family taken

His daughter killed

But no one now knows the story

The suffering, the sacrifice, and the pain

Of Otto Frank
/r/morbidrealityI am very sorry. Great picture, but i will never understand the phenomena of western people about Anna Frank. 

I invite You to Poland. In every village we should have around 50 of such museums, and in Warsaw a whole district turned into one.

Why no one is talking for example about Witold Pilecki, who was really a hero and showed no fear to nazis just to save other people.

There actually is life in the dunes, it just is mostly very small. Fog rolls across every morning, and from this small plants get enough moisture to live (there is less than 1cm of rain per year). Small animals (mostly lizards who burrow into the sand) live off the plants and the few insects that are around.

Is this spot in a no entry zone for what ever reasons?I can think of no more terrifying place from a survival standpoint.I'm amazed how there are no plants adapted to filtering salt and setting roots in the sand.That's funny. Because I've seen what the actual place where the Namib meets the sea looks like and it's called NamDeb (short for Namibia DeBeers) or more specifically, Four Plant, which is the largest coastal diamond mine they have. I've worked on it. They take the whole beach, suck it up, then suck the sand out of the potholes in the bedrock and that's the diamond rich stuff. Then they throw all that sand back where it was. The place looks afterwards exactly the way you'd imagine it looks. Like a beach turned upside down.

They will also drop their leaves starting from top to bottom.  If the entire row is Acer saccharum, there may be a building out of frame to the right, reducing the sunlight those trees closer to the photographer recieve.

That was ballsy. The story about the image is pretty incredible. After three days on a small boat searching for polar bears in Repulse Bay, Nunavut, Canada, Joe got lucky. 

He said, 'We cruised at a distance, so we didn't disturb the bear. Once we were sure it was relaxed with our presence, I slipped quietly into the water with just a mask and fins, attached to the boat by a rope.' 

The polar bear now started to swim towards the boat. It didn't appear to notice Joe, and for 20 minutes he was able to take photographs from the water. But then the bear caught sight of its own reflection in the dome port and swam up to Joe. 

'It's amazing when a huge, powerful animal comes beside you.'

It came so close that its nose touched the housing, startling it. The second after Joe took this shot, the bear reached out and touched the dome with its paw. Then it turned and swam away, leaving Joe with an unforgettable image - symbolic 'of the power and elegance of a wonderful creature struggling to survive in a fast-changing climate'.and that was the last shot he ever got?Polar bears are quite amazing animals. During World War II the Finnish army used many trained polar bears to transport heavy munitions in the most adverse weather conditions.

In fact, polar bears are the fourth most militarily decorated animals, after horses, dogs and pigeons.An hour from now on Facebook:

This polar bear and his entire family drowned from global warming, _like this_  if you want to join the fight against Obama destroying their habitat!He kind of looks like when you have been treading water for a while and you are tired so you are just trying to keep you head floating above water and barely trying to swim. Looks like that polar bear's having nunavut.From looking at his face, it looks like you jacked a bottle of Coca-Cola from him and he's coming to kick your ass.[Not a month ago, an article was posted here describing how a photographer got killed by a bear after venturing into their habitat](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/26/us/alaska-bear-attack). The article mentioned his family, his passion for the environment, his respect for bears...he seemed like a genuinely nice guy.

Everyone here called him a moron who deserved to die.

Now, this guy swims up within arm's reach of an even deadlier bear, and people are commending him on his courage...?

You people are fucking weird.

And before I hear the ""Yeah because Reddit is a singular entity with one mindset pfft""...it really, technically is. One person posts an opinion; another person posts an opposite opinion, and people decide which opinion they agree with. And, overwhelmingly, people trashed the guy who got killed doing what he lived.

There is really no difference between him and the guy who took this shot. They both knew the risks, they both love(d) what they do/did...and yet you people were callous enough to call the other guy a moron months after he died. No respect whatsoever.Am i the only one who thinks this looks like digital art ?/r/bearsPolarBear Ursus Maritimus spent three days swimming looking for photographers in Nunavut and very nearly got the guy behind this camera. So this isn't about the image, it's about how the image came about.

There's no photographic genius/innovation aside from the laudable amount of patience on behalf of the photographer.

This confuses me, in a way that I'm torn between being angry and amazed.R.I.P. Joe Bunni.There is just something so incredibly special about polar bears.I wonder how long he's been swimming?His waterproof camera and bloody camera strap were discovered two weeks after the photo was shot.Enjoy them while we can.

At my parents' house, I always enjoy seeing the hummingbirds fly around. The best is when two or three get into a territory battle over the feeder my mom keeps next to the deck.

You may have just interrupted a flying lesson. 

""Q. I found a baby bird on the ground. What should I do? I don't want it to die.

A. At some point, nearly everyone who spends time outdoors finds a baby birdone that is unable to fly well and seems lost or abandoned. Our first impulse is to adopt the helpless creature, but this often does more harm than goodand in most cases, the young bird doesn't need our help at all.

The first thing to do is to figure out if it's a nestling or a fledgling. If it's sparsely feathered and not capable of hopping, walking, flitting, or gripping tightly to your finger, it's a nestling. If so, the nest is almost certainly nearby. If you can find the nest (it may be well hidden), put the bird back as quickly as possible. Don't worryparent birds do not recognize their young by smell!

If the bird is feathered and capable of hopping or flitting, and its toes can tightly grip your finger or a twig, it's a fledgling. Fledglings are generally adorable, fluffy, with a tiny stub of a tail. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that the bird has been abandoned and needs you. But fledglings need a special diet, and they need to learn about behavior and vocalizations from their parentsthings we can't provide. 

Fortunately, the vast majority of ""abandoned"" baby birds are perfectly healthy fledglings. Their parents are nearby and watching out for them. The parents may be attending to four or five young scattered in different directions, but they will most likely return to care for the one you have found shortly after you leave.

When fledglings leave their nest they rarely return, so even if you see the nest it's not a good idea to put the bird back init will hop right back out. Usually there is no reason to intervene at all beyond putting the bird on a nearby perch out of harm's way. Fledglings produce sounds that their parents recognize, and one of them will return and care for it after you leave.

If you have found both parents dead or are otherwise absolutely certain that the bird was orphaned, then your best course of action is to bring it to a wildlife rehabilitator. A sick, injured or orphaned baby bird may need emergency care until you can get it to a wildlife rehabilitator."" -

Grave of a Catholic woman and her Protestant husband. The Protestant Colonel of Cavalry, JWC of Gorkum married the Catholic damsel JCPH of Aefferden. This ""mixed"" marriage, at that time (the 19th century), would have given them trouble. The wife wanted to be buried next to her husband, but the difference in their denomination would not allow that. So the Colonel was buried in the Protestant part, against the separation wall and his wife was buried on the Catholic side.

http://pinterest.com/pin/35888128251982883/This is cool, but there's no wall separating them under ground. Down there, they're laying side by side.As a Jew who married a Christian, one of the arguments my mother tried to use to get me to reconsider was ""Don't you want to be buried next to your husband?  You know he can't be buried in a Jewish Cemetery with you.""  That's not what's important to me and my life; if that's so, then I won't be buried in one.  Marrying him or not being buried in a Jewish cemetery doesn't make me less of one.How touching. If they weren't allowed to be buried together, then who approved that gigantic and presumably very heavy tombstone to be built and erected in that exact spot, which connects their adjoining plots?""You can't be buried together!""

A friend of mine grew up in rural Midwest US his father was Lutheran (Missouri Synod) and his mother Catholic.  His father's family went way back in the history of their local country church (Lutheran), did lots of work on it over the years, supported financially and attended faithfully.   My friend and his mother went to the Catholic Church AND to the Litheran service on Sundays.   When his mom died of cancer the Lutherans wouldn't allow her to be buried in their cemetery in his dad's family plot like they'd always planned.  The Missouri Synod is still very picky about all of that even today.   Instead they bought a plot in the Catholic cemetery where they could both eventually be buried together.   Say what you will about Catholics, but at least where I am (which is pretty Red conservative) people gave up saying anything about what religion your spouse is or who's buried where a long time ago.

We got married by an Irish boat captain who charged us a bottle of good whiskey... and offers a money-back guarantee on his marriages.that's a recipe for a haunting if i ever saw oneWhen my Catholic grandma married my Protestant grandpa, she had to wear a simple white skirt and jacket instead of a ""real"" wedding dress. I always thought it was prettier than her sisters' dresses who married Catholic.This is one of the most moving things that I've seen on Reddit.This is beautiful!","{'Openness': 0.158, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Sadness': 0.132287, 'Anger': 0.587805, 'Extraversion': 0.89, 'Joy': 0.050481, 'Agreeableness': 0.761, 'Emotional_Range': 0.861, 'Tentative': 0.119, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.054703, 'Fear': 0.283995, 'Conscientiousness': 0.034}",{}

Landing on the moon is something to be proud of, even if you are 40 years late.

Now, who's going to be the first to build a habitable moon base? I've grown tired of people floating around in Earth's sky. I want to see a colony on the moon. Mars is alright, but the moon is a weekend trip.I gotta say, that I'm surprised at how little press this has gotten.  Maybe I'm just so far removed from most media these days, but I wasn't even aware that the Chinese were going there, and in most of my news feeds, its just a passing blurb, if its mentioned at all.It would be awesome if they were able to go to where the original Apollo missions landed and see what happened to the American flag that was planted thereNot sure if new picture is in color, or if it matters, because it's the moon.Many people don't realize that we won't be getting pretty pictures for a few days/weeks.

Struggling to find some better pics! It has only just landed really.BS, that's New Mexico at night.Cheese, Grommit!It would be great if a space race between China and the US started for building a permanent base on the moon. Nothing helps innovation quite like competition. OMG! It looks just like the pictures from the Apollo missions! They must be staging it as well. How far will the moon landing conspiracy go?NICE TRY, KUBRICK!

I swear, 30+ years later and they're still using the same quality backdrop.Harumph. Clearly, another moon conspiracy. Note the lack of stars in the sky.

Nice try, Illuminati.Everyone is like ""LOLOLOL A LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY YA COMMIE"" and I'm just like ""Congrats China, really happy for you""I know this will never happen (I will list the reason I can think of), but I would love to see a rover land at an old Apollo site and send the pictures back to Earth. There is at least one leftover vehicle that (I am told) would just need a fresh battery that might be of use. This would finally put to rest the ""theory"" that the moon landings were faked.

Why it won't happen: 

1) China has no political reason to prove that the US was there

2) We have already done science in the landing areas, so there are better places to land with fresh science 

3) It may be harder than I think to hit such a small area when landing. I'm sure it's a Herculean challenge just to get down in one piece

That's all I can think of for now. I am sure the hivemind will downvote me and list all of the things I am clearly too stupid to think of. Would it mean war if the Chinese rover knocked over our American flag?""We're Whalers on the moon!""Yep, it's still there.Omg, where are the stars? So fake!

Edit: Google saves the day! Yep, Bell still does this: http://www.bellhelmets.com/crash-replacementThis is a good illustration of why part of helmet safety is the helmet being slippery.  A lot of people wonder why those cheap bicycle helmets have foam on the inside and a thin little plastic shell taped to the outside.  That thin little plastic shell is an important safety feature.  It ensures the helmet will slide on impact rather than gripping an rotating (and twisting your neck).Think of this guy's jaw if he'd been wearing a ½ shell or ¾ helmet instead... Full face for the win...My dad was telling me about how when he was riding to a motorcycle convention in Arizona, as soon as his group crossed statelines from CA into AZ, they all took their helmets off.

nope nope nope nope.

1. I get to look like a spaceman.

2. Only way I know of to legally conceal your identity.


Bonus - You don't die or get horribly disfigured if you crash. (You also get to look like a spaceman)
My helmet snapped my collar bone 25mm apart when I landed on my head. 

Dread to think what would have happened if I hadn't been wearing it.On my 17th birthday I was hit by a car driven by a 15y/o that was learning to drive with his mom.

I never had a chance to brake the bike and flew almost 15 meters into the air. Broke my left collarbone and had amnesia for like 8 hours.

My integral FM helmet saved my life. It broke near the maxilar and the scratch left on the pavement was a good 10 meters.

I still keep that helmet.



Edit: Fixed Break for Brake.I think a few have mentioned, but be sure to retire that helmet. It will not protect you again. ATGATTI can agree with that life tip.

I wouldn't even be mad, I'd stand up and clap as she rode off into those plastic flappy things.Something similar happened to me 10 years or so ago at Vancouver, trying to fly back to Toronto for Christmas with Air Canada.

There was one person checking people in for multiple flights, with easily 400+ people in line, and it was such a nightmare that they basically delayed all of their flights to try and give time for everyone to board their respective plane.  Some flights had a 5 hour delay.

I started to take pictures of the line, and an Air Canada ""manager"" asked what I was doing in a very terse and disapproving tone, and I said, ""my cousin is a senior editor for the Globe and Mail [big Canadian newspaper] and I figured he'd be interested in how Air Canada only has one person on staff to deal with the fully expected Christmas rush... there, just emailed them to him"".

He fucked off in a tizzy, but within 30 minutes emergency staff were on hand to help process the passengers.  In one case, a mother brought her two kids in and they sat beside her while she was processing passengers.

Last time I ever flew Air Canada.  Fuck that airline.AMA Request: that woman working at DeltaI've worked in customer service for 7 years now and a recurring nightmare I have is having to deal with lines like this. That poor lady, I would probably be in tears. Is this related to the broken website today? They were selling $25 tickets from LAX to JFK, etc.When I was 19, I worked at McDonald's part time. We were terribly understaffed with only 3 people when two busloads of people empty filling the lobby (the section I was working). We went from anticipating a slow night and therefore sending people home early to having one of the busiest nights they've ever hard. I had to take a moment and told the person next at the register to give me one moment. I walked to the back of the building, into the refridgerator, then the freezer and screamed at the top of my lungs.

My immense sympathy to this lady. I'll never fly Delta for treating not only their customers so poorly, but clearly their employees.My friend had a nightmare of a time with Delta when she was flying back home, internationally. They screwed her over by delaying the flight until the next day and wouldn't work with her to get a seat anywhere else, nor to assist in rebooking her ticket.

She stayed the night in the airport and the next day, the flight was delayed for 4 hours, again! She decided to just buy a different ticket from a different airline (this airline was very accommodating and helpful), and dealt with Delta once she was back home.

Never Delta - never again. Don't people check in online?  How would this happen? As a former Delta employee I feel like that station manager is gonna be in a lot of shit. I wish more people realized that this is a pretty common occurrence in customer service.  

Low end employee is often shafted into a terrible situation, and since there is no one else physically present to blame, most guests/customers will be quite unpleasant to the lone employee.  

Ho hum.Pro tip: As soon as your pilot announces that you will be deplaning, call your airline. Follow everyone else to get in line to be rebooked in case the line is quicker or you absolutely need to talk to someone face-to-face (i.e. checked a bag).Delta customer service is a joke. I took Delta only once, and it was a nightmare. Flight was from Atlanta to New York, scheduled to take off at 5PM. 6PM comes and goes,  then 7, then 8 with no updates other than ""we should be leaving the gate shortly."" Meanwhile the couple behind me has a very young (few months old?) baby with them that was very fussy. They were constantly asking the steward/stewardesses for updates, with no results.

 Finally the guy gets frustrated, and raises his voice a bit and says ""can someone fucking tell me when we'll be taking off? My baby can't take much more of being cooped up like this"". The steward makes some smart-ass response and walks off again. 10 minutes later, two burly security agents come aboard with the same steward, who then order the guy to step off the plane. When asked why, the steward claims the guy had ""physically threatened him, and that he did not feel safe with the guy onboard"". 

Despite surrounding passengers (including me) vouching for the guy and saying he hadn't made any physical or even verbal threats, and was just getting frustrated do to his kid, the security agents refused to listen and gave him the choice of either coming willingly or being cuffed and taken away. The guy had no choice but to go with them, while the mother and child remained onboard stunned.

10 minutes later the captain announces we are finally ready to leave the gate and taxi. The wife jumps up in a panic, asking where her husband was. Staff reply was to shrug, and say ""probably somewhere in the airport. You can get off or stay onboard, but if you disembark now you won't be refunded."" The wife obviously got off to be with her husband.

Sincerely,  
A UPS truck loader in your areaI tried giving my UPS guy a tip but he got awayi spoke with a USPS employee and this year in my area they weren't leaving packages on doorsteps due to 4 reports of stolen goods off porches, all on Xmas eve. WTF people[This is how russians do it.!](http://imgur.com/rnTRsgM)My UPS driver knows my name and stops me when he sees me walking outside to give me my packages. I think I order too much stuff online...

Today he saw me walking outside and stopped me to give me packages. Once realizing they were too big for me to carry back myself, he took the time to drive over and drop them off for me at my door. There are lots of good guy UPS delivery drivers! :)Yeah, we were out of town for Christmas, got back early afternoon the day after. UPS man had stashed late Tuesday deliveries behind the trash can on our porch - invisible from the street. Good guy, UPS man.A lot of UPS/Fedex/Post employees are really cool. You often hear about the really bad apples because people love drama I guess, and those negative situations spread quickly

I know the guys delivering stuff to my house are fantastic. One day I was expecting a delivery for a fairly large, expensive, and most importantly one of a kind unique item, with no signature required. I knew I'd be home for the delivery since I work from home, so all was well. On the day of the delivery, about an hour or so before usual delivery, I get a call asking me to come in to work.

I'm freaking out a bit because while I've never had mail stolen, this is a large package that won't fit in a mailbox. I didn't feel like I had much choice so I wrote a note apologizing profusely for the situation and asking if they could leave it in my backyard shed. I was so happy to come home and see my package neatly placed inside the shed, with the door locked closed. I really didn't expect the delivery man to do that because I know they're by no means obligated to carry stuff to your backyard, and this thing was like 40~ pounds. Complete respect and appreciation to the guy who took the time to read and follow my instructions just to make sure my package got there safely.Ups guy had a blanket in one of those big white envelope type things. He thought he'd just toss it up onto the balcony (Live in a house above a garage) He tossed about 3 ft too high and it went onto the awning, My mom had to hold his legs while he tried to poke it with a broom, while his buddy in the truck told him where to poke.""...and when he opens the door, the shovel handle is going to fall right into his fucking face""[Gaining your trust](http://iwatchseries.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/south-park-season-16-ep-7.png)Your UPS guy is *way* better than [this douche.](http://mefunnysideup.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Douchebag-UPS-Guy.gif)Knowing Amazon, I could believe that there's only a gift card in that box.As an ex-Fedex driver, this is the only creative thing drivers get to do on a daily basis. Kinda sad actually.I think if I delivered packages I would make a challenge out of hiding packages. Then I would likely end up in trouble because I would hide them too well. In Belgium we've got several services like Kiala that basically set up tons of checkpoints all over the city (usually in magazine stores or neighbourhood stores and the likes), and allows delivery services to safely deliver packages to a more secure location. Seems like that might be a good idea to start a company for.I am married to the local Santa, aka UPS man. The job is routine.  He works during extreme heat, snow, cold, etc.  He is not allowed to call off.  My husband has worked with fevers as high as 103.4. He never calls off.  He never, ever has a day under 9.5 hours.  
On the plus side, he is the hardest worker I know  he provides for our family,, and does what he is supposed to do.  In today's society, it is a good job. 
 He does get some candy and some small treats at Christmas.   He does not get money. In our area, people can't afford it. 
Most people who have tried to work there, quit within 2 months. It is a hard job. You have 3 minutes to get in and out of places, regardless of the number of packages.  He tries to hide all of the packages so other people won't steal them.  He really cares about his job and the people he delivers to every day. In all professions, there are jerks..period. He is not one of them. 
He is my hero...it sucks not having him home until 8-9 o'clock every night. He misses so much of our children's lives.  On the other hand, two year ago, with almost 486,000 worth of medical bills, his insurance was incredible.  Just remember, when complaining about someone, chances are that person is someone else's world. He had been a driver for over 25 years.  He even has had two knee replacements. All to take care of us...I am thankful to him and to UPS for a good home to raise my children.

It looks beautiful,...in a creepy sort of way.I can confirm this.
When i was younger i scratched my eye with a piece of wire and had to go to hospital. At the hospital a doctor put a few drops of die in my eye and used a light to see the scratch, as he did this I could see all the blood vessels IN MY OWN EYE! 
This has to be one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had.It's amazing how pattern reoccur every time...

http://gizmodo.com/5872157/freakythis-simple-trick-lets-you-see-the-blood-vessels-in-your-eyeFor some reason this photo reminded me of the story where a guy who checked into a hotel looked through the lockhole of a supposedly haunted room to see a lady in white standing in the corner of the room. Empty room, carpeted floor, red curtains, just the lady in the corner. 

The next day he peeped through the lockhole but all he saw was red. Perplexed, he asked the receptionist about the hauntings in the room.

If this were a picture of a civilian child after a missile strike I guarantee no one in this thread would be cracking jokes.

Amsterdam is a beautiful place.From my time living in Holland a number of years ago, I still remember the saying ""You live in Rotterdam, you work in Den Hague, and you party in Amsterdam.""  
  
That said, there's so much more to the country than Amsterdam. If you're actually interested in the Dutch, I'm not sure how accurate the picture is from Amsterdam. I think it's akin to basing every judgement about Americans on Las Vegas.  
  
And the thing that really struck me the most about this city is just how diverse it is. You can leave the train station and walk past all the coffee shops, past the Red Light District, and within a short walking distance you can visit the Anne Frank House or Van Gogh museum. It's definitely worth a visit. What the fuck are those people doing inside their houses?Maybe this was the photographers interpretation of the city. I mean, c'mon, it's Amsterdam.

[nice, but it seemed to be missing something...](http://i.imgur.com/atfvu6s.jpg)Are you the Doctor?Cromag portals from Sliders***IT'S A BOY!***It has a Georgia O'Keeffe vibe.This photo was taken with a Digital SLR camera.  Probably with a normal (50 mm) lens.   It's hard to know what the camera settings were, as we don't know how fast the train was going, how much light is in the tunnel, etc. But it's a safe assumption that the shutter was open for some time...probably between 1-4 seconds. Then, assuming not much light in the tunnel, you open the aperture all the way up (f/4.5 or so), and set the ISO up as needed...possibly this is at ISO 800- ISO 1600, I would guess.

Then, you have to stabilize the camera. For this, we can assume that he used the inside of the train to steady the camera, probably by pushing the side of the camera against a stable surface inside the train.

My family rented a house at the beach (Sandbridge, VA) when I was 13 or 14. My brothers and I spent the entire day building a ""sand fort"", which was essentially a 3-foot hole in the ground big enough for 3 kids to sit in. When the day was over we planted a few beach chairs around it to make sure nobody stumbled into it by accident.

Well, that's exactly what happened anyways. The next morning police knocked on the door and asked if we were responsible for the hole on the beach. Turns out a random guy was running on the beach in the pitch dark and fell into it, breaking his ankle. 

15 years later and we still haven't lived that story down. http://i.imgur.com/4KFKQxM.jpgI feel like my feet would get really cold in that trenchIt's sort of like an inverted fire pit.And these castles made of sand, slip into the sea, eventually...How far we have comeDragonstone is actually pretty chill when Melisandre is away.Dig out the chair part and put benches/adirondack/lawn chairs there. That will collapse so easily.That's totally me in my dorm back in the school daze.  
  
Except instead of sand, I had a shag rug.  
  
And instead of a fire, I had Rush on the stereo.  
  
Perhaps not surprisingly, I did have the same number of guests. aaaaand it's time to go home.This reminds me of the fort they built in Rocket power.This motivates me to have a bombfire and do this. But laws here in LA about bombfires suck ass, so nvm.I've done things similar to this at the beach before but not quite to this level. If we have a few guys going we'll bring a few shovels with us and dig sand couches out of the embankments going down to the water or up further on the beach so the tide doesn't destroy it. The only problem with not doing it on an embankment is you don't get a good view of the beach and water when sitting because your eye level is so low to the ground. However, if you dig it out of the embankment it's basically like putting a couch on the downslope to the water so you just sit, relax and watch the beach and waves. It gets destroyed with the incoming tide but those few hours are worth it. 

Side note: we once dug a wrap-around couch up on the beach that could sit about 5-6 people comfortably and 8 if you squeezed tight, that's the largest I've ever done. imagine this guy did this during the period in which humans were discovering earth, he would be the party god. sacrifices and strange mushrooms for everyone!This is what pledges are foruntil high tide...Also, probably illegal.It's great until someone accidentally kicks the inner wall, collapsing it, and dumping burning coals into everyone. That is really a great idea!Now just one solid high tide...(evil laugh)Shame he has no one to share it withNow, if he had made the entrance on the other side as the tide comes in it will make a little moat for him soak his feet before being completely washed away.","{'Openness': 0.357, 'Analytical': 0.061, 'Sadness': 0.122011, 'Anger': 0.609059, 'Extraversion': 0.67, 'Joy': 0.044962, 'Agreeableness': 0.727, 'Emotional_Range': 0.651, 'Tentative': 0.304, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.24054, 'Fear': 0.293103, 'Conscientiousness': 0.243}",{}

It's irony, probably every single person in that picture has lost a loved one to the civil war that is raging in that country, and not a single american politician seems to give a shit. 

Don't thank them for their condolences, a thousand Syrians have died for every victim of the Boston Bombings. Their lives are worth just as much as yours. We should be supporting them, that's the message of the sign. 

edit: I'm sorry I can't reply to everyone, I simply don't have the time. The Syrian rebels have links to Al Qaeda. If/when they eventually kill Syria's president Al-Assad, Syria will go downhill just like Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan... And others.The bombers are connected with the same line of ""rebels"" that come out of Chechnya and fight along side these ""freedom fighters"".  Last report had the rebels at 90% foreign nationals, which by my counts doesn't constitute a popular revolution.

Holy shit, what a cesspool. It's like I walked into a high school cafeteria. Thank God for the unsubscribe feature.Why does everyone seem to think America should be helping everyone?

What about Germany, Britain, Sweden, China, Japan, etc?

The US has gotten a reputation that won't fall off where people expect us to help or expect us to stop helping. 

IMO, we should be helping anywhere we can - but no one should see the US as the bad guys if they do or dont help someone when there are so many others sitting in the background doing nothing. Last I checked it was mother russia not US.Translation: We're sorry that you had a bad day.  We know what that's like because WE HAVE BAD ENTIRE LIVES.[deleted]Isn't Russia and China the ones that are blocking the U.S. and others from intervening with the Syrian conflict?

Also the freedom fighters are fighting against a legitimate government that is recognized on the world scene. It's all about perspective. Thanks for the support, Syrians.The reason that Boston resonates more with anyone in North America, or affected by Western culture is the phenomenon of cultural proximity. Make a checklist of sports teams, schools, celebrities, musicians, historical events and figures that are connected to Boston. I did, went on wikipedia as well to find out more and was shocked about how much has come out of that city. 

Now do the same with Syria. Or Kandahar. Or Iran. Unless you have a personal connection I'm going to guess your list is short. 

That is not to say these people's suffering is any less. We just feel more for what we know more about. It probably has it's roots in the Ice Age where we had to look out for our tribe and turn off feelings for others. The fact that I can have empathy for those in Boston and never been there is a pretty big step for humanity. It will take an alien invasion probably for us all of us to feel for the whole world, but there will always be someone saying 'oh what about the pod people and their tentacles' 

Boston's suffering is valid, people feeling bad about it is ok.

A few folks below have commented that spherical shaped shrapnel seems like it would make more sense than cube shaped (which, purely based on flight characteristics and penetration for a given weight of material, would probably be true).

In reality there are a lot of factors here besides just the shape of the projectile - the engineers who built this also considered weight, density of packing and (most important in the decision making process here) ease of manufacture.  The key thing to realize here is that those little square shapes you see are in fact the notched surface of long coiled wire running around the inner surface of the grenade, rather than individually placed cubes.  This technically makes them [pre-formed fragmentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_\(weaponry\)), rather than [shrapnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell).

So to start, this is an [M26A1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M26_grenade) grenade (edit: or possibly a later variant within the M26 family).  The hollow area was filled with just under 6oz of Composition B, (one of the most common explosive fillers for decades) a mix of TNT and RDX.  It was developed as a replacement for the TNT-filled [mkII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_2_grenade) ""pineapple"" grenade based on studies done on fragmentation characteristics and design considerations to improve them.  Also for comparison, check out this cutaway of the much more crudely built [mk II](http://www.bocn.co.uk/vbforum/attachments/DSCI0004b.jpg).

Either one of these fillers (TNT and Comp B) has high enough [brisance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisance) to easily shatter the simple, brittle, cast-iron shell of the mkII into small slivers and chunks, which are then propelled outwards as deadly fragmentation.  The groves in the mkII shell were intended to improve the grip of the thrower, but later study revealed the fragmentation characteristics of this design were less than ideal.  Some parts of the grenade would separate in large iron chunks, which would greatly damage anything they hit but lower the probability of hitting anything as the distance from the blast increased.  Other portions of the shell would shatter into small shards traveling at extremely high velocities - these had a high likelihood of hitting nearby objects, but suffered from inadequate penetration and slowed quickly with distance.  The result was that the product was less consistent than desired; an ideal grenade would reliably incapacitate any enemy within a certain radius by casting an even spread of similarly sized fragments with velocity and mass high enough to meet the wounding requirements.  Fragments larger than this threshold may be more deadly, but reduce the total number of fragments available from a given mass of fragment material, potentially lowering overall grenade efficiency since any projectile exceeding the size/velocity needed to meet the wounding requirement is a waste of material.  Fragment shape is also a big issue for aerodynamics and penetration, since shattering produces chunks of all different shapes, often jagged shards and splinters that don't perform as well as more consolidated chunks like cubes or spheres.

So when they went back to the drawing board to design the next generation of grenade, the engineers needed to figure out a way to get more consistent fragmentation than a cast iron shell offered, which would meet the lethality requirements and spread out in a consistent pattern no matter which way the grenade was oriented, while continuing to be simple enough in design to manufacture in mass.  The original M26 was designed with this in mind and was built by winding a coil of notched cylindrical wire within the shell of the grenade, so that fragmentation size and distribution would be predetermined according the spacing between the notches.  This was much easier to manufacture than individually forming and arranging shrapnel balls in the casing, since the cord could be rapidly wrapped from one end to the other.  The next revision of the design (M26A1) switched from cylindrical wire to square-cross-section wire to maximize the packing characteristics of the material being used to line the walls of the grenade.  

If you use cylindrical wire you will need to either space the notches further apart or use thicker wire in order to get fragments equal to the mass of a square-shaped wire, but will then be able to wrap it fewer times around the inner shell of the grenade.  In other words, once you come up with the ideal mass of each fragment, you will get a greater number of fragments across a given surface area by using cube shaped fragments than sphere or cylinder (the math works out to around 12.8% more projectiles with a square cross section design).

**Edit:**  I reworded some bits to make it more sensible.  This is fascinating stuff... thanks for obliging my nerding out here.  

**Edit 2:  Thanks for the gold!  Woohoo!**

**Edit 3:** For those that asked; I studied as a mechanical/aerospace engineer at uni, worked on a range of projects involving turbojet design and construction and contributed to a NASA-commissioned feasibility study for a radiation shielding project which may be implemented should we ever go to Mars.  Then when I reached the point where I would have to choose an career path and get a job, and all the most interesting ones were in the defense sector.  I've had a natural curiosity of things that roar and boom my whole life, but ultimately the ethical issues of actually designing weapons that could one day be used on people were too big for me, so I changed careers and am now in tech.  But that doesn't mean I'm not still fascinated by all of this.

I can't work it out it seems like a very complex machine for a simple fuse.More on the M26. http://inert-ord.net/usa03a/usa3/m61/index.html

I used the M67, the current grenade issued in the US Army. It was neat to throw, but it didn't produce the giant fireballs and explosions like they show on TV and movies. In the open, they do alright. Throw in a room or closed space, now that's something to see. More info:

My grandfather worked on fuzes throughout his career, this one is designed to explode immediately if it is picked up again after its been thrown. 

He worked on fuzes ranging from this grenade to the Davy Crockett and everything in between. I always thought there was more explosives than that.

Said he was the real deal and just about the nicest guy  ever met. One of my prized possessions is a signed copy of one of his books that my Uncle asked him for specifically for me.

Mr Carter and I likely disagree on a few items, but he's a good man.He looks like a young Sci-Fi actor who has been artificially aged using prosthetics.Jimmy created both the Department of Energy and Department of Education. He tried to convert us to the metric system. Since retiring he has worked tirelessly as a humanitarian. He is perhaps the most ethical person to have ever held the Presidential Office, and continues to serve his nation and humanity just because it is the right thing to do. God bless him. We were all Republican voters in Alabama.  That's why it surprised me about 12 years ago when my mother-in-law gave me Jimmy Carter's book about his childhood, ""An Hour Before Daybreak"" as a Christmas Gift. I read it.  I told her later that it turned out to be one of the best gifts I've ever been given. A surprise, and a treasure.

I could not wait to vote against that redneck peanut farmer when I was a prick of a young man, 19 in 1976, and I voted for the incumbent, Gerald R. Ford that year.

It was one of the worst decisions I ever made. My own mother, incidentally, supported Jimmy Carter, against the wishes of my father. I remember her insisting that we should turn our thermostat down to 68 degrees and wear sweaters and sock in the house because ""the President has asked us to sacrifice because there is an energy crisis.""

And I laughed at her, and I laughed at President Carter.

I was only a kid.  I am no longer that kid.  Jimmy Carter was the ONLY principled US President of my lifetime.
[deleted][deleted]This shows two things:

1. A good man has a tough time in Washington, dealing with the imbedded dirtbags.  It makes me sad for our country that people who actually want to make things better have to fight both parties and all the corporate lobbyists. 

2. Hearing Donald Trump bad-mouth this man just shows what a complete douche-bag ass-hat Trump is.

As a lame a president he was, this man really is a good human being. Even as the OPEC imposed embargo, and the US hit severely by it as well as its own peak in production of oil, he had these words to say,

Seeing how we don't even have hills where I live this scenery was out of this world for me. My friend from Calgary took me here to go up Sulfur mountain and it was well worth it. If you have the time and are capable I would recommend hiking up the mountain instead of taking the cable cars. I was pretty hungover when I did this but still enjoyed the hike up.

I will always remember that bridge as the place where, when arriving in town, I pulled up next to a transit bus that had been vinyl-wrapped with wildlife pictures of elk, one of which was right next to my passenger window and had on display a larger-than-life set of elk testicles so close that my wife could almost reach out and stroke them.

Great experience. 

I only found out the day before that I'd be doing it.  I was thinking maybe we'd have a 20% chance of seeing some from a distance, but no, those lovable humpbacked bastards were basically swarming the boat for hours to do their own people-watching, diving under the boat and turning around to make another pass to look at us, just like we were looking at them. 

Occasionally the captain would say that this particular pod was getting boring, so we'd go and look at another pod a few hundred metres away. They were everywhere.

The guys who ran the ship said that they have really good eyesight, and that's a big part of how they navigate. So they get above water to see where the land is. Hence OP's photo.

There was one 4-6 week old baby humpback which was breaching every time it came up to breathe. Every minute or perhaps 45 seconds  it would jump out of the water, twist, and fall on its back. It didn't come close to investigate us like the bigger ones were. 

It's a pretty cool thing really. Apparently their numbers in that region were down to around 300 in the late 1960s when hunting stopped, but now there's around 17000 of them coming down the coast of Eastern Australia every year. Most of them just swim nonstop down to Antarctica, but around 5000 of them stop off in Hervey Bay to relax for a bit and people-watch.

Apparently the really big ones (the ones that sing) come through later in the season. The captain kept referring to ""when the really big adult males come through in October"".See a video of it [here:](http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/rare-white-humpback-whale-spotted-near-norway.html#mkcpgn=fbsci1)...

Everyone in the film had some grand learning experience. Coach Irving reinvigorated his passion in the sport after years of absense, Derice learns the skill of leadership and representing his country rather than copying the professionals, Yul learns to be a team player, and Junior learns to stand up to his dad and be a man. But Sanka doesn't go through any significant change, he doesn't even learn how to deal with the cold. But that doesn't matter, because he's the rock that doesn't change, and he carries an unbroken Jamaican spirit with him, which everyone else forgot about, which was ultimately the key to their performance. Sanka is the real hero of the movie, and I think from this we can learn a lot about pride in our identity and walking into the unknown waving your banners high.

So you can't use it unless you are having a tour of the SLC :P Still very pretty to look at especially at night when it is all lit up!Black FlagThat one Octodad partI've been there! The elevator ride was pretty cool but the attached aquarium was awful. Admission for an adult was 18 and, in my opinion, the experience was not worth it. There was a massive fiberglass model of a shark over the doorway and many more inside but no sharks over a couple feet were shown.  There was randomly a hall of mirrors in the middle of the aquarium which didn't seem to fit at all. There was not many other types of sea life and the whole thing was pretty lame. Overall the admission was much too high for the quality of exhibits. The Berlin Zoo had a terrific aquarium though!

TL;DR: Go to Berlin Zoo's aquarium instead of this one!I live in Berlin and didn't even know that this is a thing. I used to work at an aquarium company, and did a little research about this tank years ago. Here's what I remember:

The cylinder was built by a company called Reynolds. It is the largest cylindrical aquarium in the world (or was when I was looking. We used to get our cylinders from them, but the biggest we ever built was 12 ft. 

The tank is built from acrylic. It was most likely done by fusing two or even four (or more!) sections of curved plastic. The glue used for aquariums is cyanide based and creates a chemical bond that makes the seams the strongest points. It consists of an outer cylinder, and an inner cylinder which houses the elevators. 

The hotel has a group of divers to continuously clean the tank. They have one diver in it at all times (one diver out, one diver in). 

I cannot recall if it was a live reef or artificial. My guess is artificial, because when it was built the light requirements for a live reef tank that tall would be ridiculous.

Although, so is a giant cylinder aquarium with elevators inside. 

Also, in case no one has mentioned it, from the fishes perspective, they have a cylinder human terrarium inside their aquarium. Abstergo's HQ in Germany?Creepy!

I have never seen this photo nor did I know this place existed, but I've had a reoccurring dream for YEARS about going with several friends somewhere overseas (I live in the US) and in the hotel lobby is THIS elevator (there's also an expensive jewelry/diamond/glass souvenir shop and a few other shops).  

As soon as I clicked on this picture I got goosebumps and instantly thought of that dream (which I haven't had in a while)!  

...just thought I'd share that.Assassins creed elevator!Now we need a video of someone inside it.  [Found it!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e9PHtUxKHs)This is just Assassins Creed 4 on PC or something Aquadom! I never went up that thing during my three months in Berlin. The 10 charge didn't seem worth it as a poor college student. Instead I probably spent that money on 10 liters of beer.I'm afraid of height, and being underwater. This is paradise :DI was curious how thick the glass (acrylic) was. Found some info on it. Blame Google translate for any weirdness in the text:

* Habitat for more than 1,500 tropical fish and over 50 different species, such as the lever and the wrasse, Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), puffer fish (Tetraodontidae), surgeonfish (Myripristinae), soldier fish (Tetraodontidae), schooling fish such as king mackerel (Scomberomorus regalis) and monos (Monodactylus argenteus)

* Height of the Aqua dome, 25 meters

* The tank consists of acrylic sheets having a wall thickness from top to bottom of 16 cm to 22 cm

* Height of the acrylic cylinder, 16 meters

* Water column, 14 meters

* Diameter, 11.50 m

* Water ring, 3 meters

* 1 million liters of Berlin Water enriched with 33 tons of sea salt (salt content 3.3%)

* Water pressure is 2.4 bar

* The water is circulated every hour complete (7 Filter / 2 circulators promote each 600 cubic meters per hour - almost the content of the aquarium)
Special Details is the two-story glass elevator inside the Aqua dome (lift height 5 meters / Weight 25 ton / capacity of 48 persons including elevator operator)

All that titanium. Thank you Russia.This will probably get buried, but when I was younger I was fascinated with the SR-71 Blackbird. My godfather was retired Air Force and personally knew many of the pilots, so for one Christmas he got me a Blackbird painting signed by nine pilots. [Here it is in my living room](http://imgur.com/ZeQWlJE). 

My godfather passed away suddenly about 10 years ago, and this is one of the last memories I have of him, so this post hits home for me. The painting is named ""Above and Beyond,"" and it definitely has a dual purpose, as he didn't have any kids, but he treated me like his own. I miss him.ground_speed_check_story.txtThey look like they could be star ships. Heck i could imagine them screaming through space launching missles at star destroyers.Would have been a really cool place to work, but you could not tell anyone on the outside how cool it was.Damn, I can't imagine the diligence and organization when putting these things together. My Favorite SR-71 Story:


There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.


It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.


I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.
Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.


We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""


Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.


Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""
And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.


Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""
I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""
For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""
It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.That's because [SR-71](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird.jpg) is basically [Y-Wing](http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100523084706/starwars/cs/images/c/cf/Y-wing.jpg)If there are any maintainers looking at this, I know y'all saw the mandatory FOD sign in the backOn Jan. 25, 1966, Pilot Bill Weaver was **flying at Mach 3.18 at 78,800 ft when his SR-71 broke apart around him. He didn't eject, the plane literally disintegrated around him.** He survived but Jim Zwayer, a Lockheed flight-test specialist, perished. Here is his amazing story, great read, hope you enjoy! http://www.thedigitalaviator.com/blog/?p=504

Here are a few pictures of SR-71, 61-7952 (the one in the story above). This SR-71 did the first-ever SR-71 inflight refueling on April 29, 1965. http://www.habu.org/sr-71/17952.htmlMy favourite SR-71 fact is the official procedure they had for if the pilot was attacked by a ground-air missile: accelerate. It flew faster than any missile. I demand little robots be installed on all major aircraft. I don't care about their uses; I just want them to have snarky personalities with only a series of beeping and whistles for communication. Any engineers here working on this?If you squint your eyes it almost looks like there's R2 units in them :PGotta love the big FOD KILLS poster in the background. :)Shameless copy of one of my precious posts:

I heard this story when I was in the Swedish navy. According to the legend (things are a bit hush hush still in the Swedish military) the base that got the radar lock got a postcard a few days later with one word on it: ""congratulations"". It was stamped in the US.

The story I heard was that the Blackbird would usually take the same route at about the same time so the Swedish Air Force had plenty of time to prepare. Sweden also had good computers in the planes so the ground radars could relay the radar lock to the plane that was already in place.

Unrelated: The Swedish navy today is counted to the worlds elite, having performed very well in international exercises:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotland_class_submarine

I also wanted to share a funny story that I heard but haven't been able to verify. HMS Carlskrona is our biggest ship and going into a US naval base we radioed ahead saying our biggest ship was on the way. The US move two hangar ships to make room and when HMS Carlskrona show up the US Navy asks ""Where's the ship?"", thinking it was an escort vessel.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSwMS_Carlskrona_(M04)Dem engines...More like a hanger deck on a battlestar.I just finished reading Skunk Works by Ben Rich, which is a book that's all about the SR-71, F-117A, and other stealth technology. Pretty cool!IMO the Blackbird is way cooler looking than rebel x-wing fighters.

Just let the stuff melt, you're gonna have to warm up the car anyway, right?

If I applied a liberal coat of RainX to the window before the storm, would: a)ice even be able to form or would the water roll off before it froze? And b) if ice did form would the RainX allow the window to open?

I live in GA so my chances to test are few and far between.I think the window is probably opened behind the sheet of ice.

It's just begging to be done.10 years later: ""Dad, why do I have a 4 point scar in my back?""Does bringing a child into the world automatically bestow a person with perfect balance? Seriously. I see moms/dads balancing a baby in one hand at my job, and groceries + a toddler in the other, like no big deal. I can't even carry a full cup of coffee. WHAT IS THE DEAL, PARENTS.Wait till she has croup and the only thing to stop her screaming is rocking her back and forth for *hours*. 

One daddy to another: please consider investing in a good rocking chair, and put that rocking chair in front of a TV. Both my kids had bad croup, and I'd cradle them while rocking them back and forth and watching episode after episode of Star Trek or The Wire. It's the only way my wife could get any sleep. 

If you have a recliner that vibrates, it's almost as good. The motion and sound calms screaming babies. 

Also: take naps whenever the opportunity presents itself. When the baby falls asleep, you should be asleep if possible, or at least in bed relaxing. Like soldiers in combat, never give up a chance to grab 15 or 20 minutes' rest. 

After a few weeks, sleep deprivation will cause both of you to become short tempered with each other. *Do not take it personally*, it's just exhaustion and hormones talking. You or your wife may say things you regret. Pretend it didn't happen and move on with your lives is my advice. 

Make sure you have infant Tylenol, baby powder (EDIT: see end), moisturizer, and Mylicon on hand at all times. Those four things are like the WD40 and duct tape of infants, they will fix 95% of all problems. In a couple months, add Orajel to the list. Seriously, have these things in your pockets *at all times* when you leave the house with the baby. 

You will smell like formula for the next six months. Deal with it. 

Keep a cloth diaper close at hand at all times, and use it, especially if you are going to be within six feet of the baby and you are already dressed for work. If you are going to be holding the baby, put the diaper over your shoulder before putting the baby down. Basically, treat the diaper as a tarp and your baby as a leaky engine. Spread the tarp first so your engine doesn't spit up formula all over your nice clean driveway. 

And remember, this will all be worth it. Having kids is the best thing ever. Nothing else you do in your personal or professional life will ever be as important as being a good daddy. 

I hope this post doesn't come across as condescending. This is all just stuff I wish I'd known when I first had kids.

EDIT: I see a few Redditors pointing out that pediatricians are no longer recommending baby powder. Therefore, strike that and replace it with a good rash cream. I recommend Boudreaux's Butt Paste, which is the best rash cream I've ever used and is also lots of fun to say. Also, when you bust it out, make sure to tell your spouse/partner ""<name of baby> has a rash on his/her ash"", because saying the same exact joke every single time a given situation arises is a natural part of being a daddy and you might as well get used to it now. id be scared shitless of dropping the baby, trying to catch it, forgetting i was holding a fork, and then stabbing the baby mid drop.A little bit of Velcro and you're ready for an infomercial.[deleted]My daughter used to be like this. Sleeping like a lazy leopard puts pressure on her tummy and lets the wind out. Try burping her for a bit longer after a feed, or massage her tummy, 20 circular rubs (clockwise to help digestion).

Also, I once saw a woman breastfeed both of her twins at once, whilst chowing down on a big ham sandwich. I was very impressed!I usually carry them the opposite way (because head is heavier than butt and it simply feels safer). http://imgur.com/f3Lt5I'm a Mom/Baby nurse.  The first week is definitely the worst.  Baby is programmed to eat every hour or two, mom's milk supply isn't entirely in yet, and you are so sleep-deprived you'd smack your mama in the face to get a 2-hour nap.  It will get better.  I admire your ingenuity.And people say men can't multitask!Try eating with a 32lb 1.5 year old on your left arm, and a 36 lb 3.5 year old on your right arm.  You have to depend on them to feed you properly, in this case.  So once they stop fighting each other, maybe they'll feed daddy.  

BTW, how do you fathers of multiple children deal with , say one is 1.5 years old, barely understanding things, but quite feisty.  Doesn't understand that the 3.5 year old has his toys that she cant touch.  But she doesn't understand this yet.  She only knows to give it back to him when he starts crying for it.  But he gets impatient and starts sacking her, at that point she will refuse to give it back and fight back.... how do I end this????  should i?  should I make him share? 

I've been telling my older son to give her one of her own toys whenever she wants to take one of his.  Or to trade for something he's not using doesn't want..  But he's still very possessive of his own toys.  Glad you weren't hungry for hot soup.My son is the same, only fall a sleep when i carry him on my arm.
Pro tip: Turn the baby around. Keep her shoulder as high up on your arm as you can (by the elbow, where her bum is now in the picture, or even higher up). 
This will be easier for you as all her weight is really in her head, and when she gets heavier you will feel the difference. 
Also it's safer (in my opinion). You can hold her thigh real easy with your hand. Instead of her head, so if she moves you won't have to stress her neck. 
Check this image: http://i.imgur.com/U3tm5.png
See how he holds the thigh? thats the secret to it beeing really comfortable, since you can have your other hand kinda free.
It's recommended that you put your other hand ontop of the child any way, but when you feel you got the hang of it. Youll notice how good it feels.Have you thought of swaddling? works like a charm for little babies. I had preemie twins and it was a life saver.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSYPqGtFBYQDon't let her get used to that bro, she'll end up one of those girls you can eat sushi off of...Man, I haven't laughed at a photo like that in the longest time. She looks like an awesome little chipmunk and I'm sure she'll appreciate you rocking that pic at her 21st birthday party. Congrats man.

A real man is not defined by macho bull shit.  A real man is a man who puts the needs of his children and family before his own.  The sacrificial man. I didn't figure this out until I had children of my own.

It is the innocence of children that forges a mans true strength. But I didn't need to say it. It is clear from the photo that you already understand.

Dude was chill as fuck I miss him. Your filth has attracted a foul bachelor frog. Congratulations.Day 45: Human still thinks i'm soap.Where does he poop and pee?I like this. Please give him a name and continue your symbiotic relationship. It fills me with a tremendous sense a well being knowing that this is happening somewhere in the world. Frogs are always cool. Just like in Dead Like Me~~Its~~ It's judging you.
Pervert frog is watching you.[deleted]I never would have guessed that a cute picture of a frog could hide such a shitstorm of OP-hating and drama. I wish I had an awesome shower frog :/He keeps the bugs down. I like it.Oh man, frogs are kickass. I remember when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old, me and a friend made some traps out of plastic bottles. We caught around 20 frogs and one trout in a single day. Ended up digging an old aquarium out of the basement and putting them in that. Made a lot of land space with aquarium sand, had a little watery bit and put the trout in there. Only problem was that my room didn't have enough space, so I had to put it in my 3 year old sisters room. Turns out frogs can jump *(Who knew)*, and will do so if put in a shitty aquarium. I awoke to the sound of my little sister laughing like a maniac and my mother flipping shit. Ran in to see the room, including my little sisters crib fucking covered in frogs. God damn that was hilarious. Then my mother found the trout. More shit was flipped, and I had to set the frogs, and the god damn motherfucking trout free in our garden. **I released a motherfucking trout into the natural fucking habitat of my god damn front lawn!** He had it coming though, that trout was a dick. Smug bastard. Watching 20 something frogs, and one trout jump around on the lawn was good fun. Me and that friend ended up having a lot of fun with frogs and trouts that summer.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, take good care of that frog, he might very well save your life one day. Oh, and trouts are dicks.He has licked your toothbrushI have never seen a group of people so concerned on the states of someone's else's shower in which they will never be. I think it's really cool that you have a little amphibian buddy in there, but the people who are bothered by him being near your toothbrush are right - frogs can carry salmonella and other germs that you don't want to get in your mouth.I like frogs a lot, he's pretty cute.  I can't help thinking he'd be happier outside.He doesn't bother you, but I bet he bothers all over your toothbrush.Frogs, like other reptiles and amphibians, can have salmonella on their skin.  Right next to your toothbrush *might* not be be the safest place to let him chill.I've got quite a few of this same species of frog living on my property (like OP, I'm also in Florida) and about two years ago we had a record breaking cold winter night. It pretty much devastated all of my tropical plants and killed dozens of these little guys. They were strewn about my property like little frozen frogsicles.

Anyway, that same morning I woke up to a frog swimming around my toilet. I had no idea how it got in there, but I calmly escorted him out of the house. On my way back in my wife shrieked, ""there's a frog in the toilet!"" To which I replied that I already got him out. But clearly I didn't because, sure enough, there was a frog in the toilet. And then another and another and another...

All told, there were around 20 frogs in the toilet itself and the pipes leading to it. According to the plumber who was hired to get them out, they crawled in there for warmth (and probably did so through the vent). It was one of the most bizarre things I'd ever experienced but the plumber disagreed, ""Nothing peculiar about it. Just got some frogs in your toilet.""

Gotta love Florida.you're gonna be pissed as fuck when he turns out to be a she and shits frog spawn all over your shower. Pissed As Fuck.
Who cares if the room is covered in lime? People shit in there anyway. There's a difference between being dirty and being old and lived in. Sorry we can't all live in the four seasons. All you people bitching about filth need to take the aerator off of your bathroom faucets and if it's not full of nasty junk I will eat my shoe. I would like to say that even though people are enraged by my shower, I made it to the front page.

Edit: Just realized this was on frontpage so you've probably seen it.Fuck I love me some good advertising.This actually gave me chills. Absolutely beautiful.I know that all Olympians work hard to get there, but Paralympians are fucking badass.What a powerful message on just one image.Note: ""Paralympics"" derives from ""Parallel Olympics,"" not ""Paralyzed Olympics."" This poster does such a good job at making a handicap seem badass that I almost want to cut my own leg off. Well done, well done indeed. It's hard to promote something like this without evoking pity, and they did it. Am I the only one who thinks paralympics is much more enjoyable to watch than normal olympics?

Just look at this list of sports they have in paralympics:

* wheelchair basketball
* wheelchair tennis
* wheelchair rugby
* 100m running, for amputees
* swimming
* etc.

I watch paralympics and end up being more impressed of them than the 'normal' participants. Major respect to the participants :)

Also, sledge icehockey is frickin awesome!Poor little tink tinkGo Emi, go!**Here is the video for it** : http://vimeo.com/35638808A picture paints a thousand words.....

Why isn't all advertising this good?  It's nice to see advertizing I want to share with other people.Very well done!This is wicked, really gives a different perspective to the paralympics games. Really well done!I've honestly never stopped and thought about what being a paralympian entailed before. It's incredible that a single image can completely put everything in perspective.One day the Paralympics will out preform the all-human Olympics. Canada <3

Ha. Ha ha. Ha ha ha. HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAA!All you have to do is keep 120 pallets lying around.  You know, in case of an emergency.

Or, build a shed you can use right now.If that house can be built in a day imagine what you could build with a stack of 2x4's and some sheets of plywood...

Building it out of proper materials would be faster, more stable, more insulating, and easier to get than the number of pallets you would need for this.What kind of situation would you be in where your current real house gets destroyed to the point of being unlivable, yet your pallet house is okay? 

Or, if it isn't built yet, your pallet cache, and necessary tools, are okay?[deleted]I'd be afraid a forklift would haul away my pallet house in the middle of the night.Splinters, splinters fucking everywhere.Pallets are made from the waste wood of the lumber industry which is discarded for a reason. It comes from the cambium area of the tree and is not adequately dense (structurally inferior and vulnerable to decomposition).As somebody who's seen a lot of pallets, those are the nicest pallets I've ever seen.

Usually I'm happy if they don't try to take my arm off when I pick one up.And, apparently, you have a spot to choke a baby and no one will see. Yes. And house plants. Because when you need a house so badly that you'll make one out of pallets, houseplants are also a huge priority.That's an art project. In what emergency would you happen to have 20 pallets on hand from which to build a house? If your house blows down, but you can drive to the local home center to steal their pallets, you probably should just go to a motel. >You can also upgraded it in time with insulation, AC, smoke detectors and anything else you would like.

No shit.

You could also upgrade it with... I don't know... a proper house?If you need plans to build a tiny house out of wooden pallets, you should use the $75 to [buy a tent.](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dsporting&field-keywords=tent) Judging by my attempts at putting together furniture from Ikea and my disatrous phase where I tried my hand at Airfix models, I would probably end up killing myself and/or others trying to assemble this.This would make a lot more sense if it was planed for Euro Pallets (120x80). Charging for the plans invalidates the humanitarian purposes!I can't think of an emergency that would require me to build a pallet house that would not also destroy my apparently large stock of pallets.one day my assAll I can think of is pokémon..Fatal oversight. If you have this many pallets to build the structure there is probably a more sturdy structure nearby housing all the goods that came in on these pallets. In case you have never worked in a warehouse environment, pallets are usually fucking disgusting; covered in dust, goo and other crap and usually don't make it to their final destination in one piece.  They also aren't exactly cheap, I work in trucking and lots of places that do 'pallet exchange' charge upwards of $5 a pallet, you could probably afford a couple 2x4s for that amount of money.  Unless you are prepared to buy all new pallets for this endeavor it seems kind of dumb.  Why not just use normal building supplies and methods if you are gonna buy new wood/materials anyways...I think Les Stroud should invest in one of these.So you're telling me there is a house behind every walmart?

Yosemite National Park RangerThat is adorableI love how there's ""accidentally brought"" in adult handwriting! Kids are cute.I just wanted to say congratulations on being a park ranger.  This was one of my first choices in a profession but I never went forward because I know how hard it is to get the position.  A friend of mine waited a decade to become a park ranger and when the offer came through she picked up and moved across country for it.  I love nature but didn't want to go through the same thing so I choose a different path.  Thank you for caring for what few care about anymore. :-)At first glance it looked like a man with awful handwriting sent a park ranger two blunts.  When my daughter was 4 she picked a trillium (provincial flower of Ontario). A family friend mentioned that it was against the law to do so, and for the whole summer that poor kid worried that the police would come and put her in jail.Lawful Good as fuck.  Kid will make a hell of a paladin some day.I hope you sent him a court summons in return.  Kids these days have no respect for nature.Hey! I was a ranger in Yosemite. I assume you're in the visitor center? 

I was on bear team for a couple years, 3 years backProduct of federal budget cuts in National Park Security.I put those sticks in nature. Sticks love nature.""Take only pictures, leave only footprints""But... won't the parents reject the sticks now that they have human scent on them? Surely this is just dooming them to a slow death :(Result of parenting done right.And those sticks were picked up by a baby beaver who added them to his family's dam, and it was that little bit of extra strength that allowed the dam to survive a flash flood, thus preventing the roaring water from killing a disabled wolf crossing the river downstream, so that wolf was alive to contract rabies the following spring and bite a visiting Junior Park Ranger named Evie, thus completing the Great Circle of Life.Dear Evie, 

Nature is full. The sticks have been euthanized.

You're a smart one. People are going to steal this idea.Dude, that's... that's some Don Draper level shit right there, man.Oh fuck that's clever.

I really like this one. It probably has effect because it's a side we forget to look at.you are indian arnt you? naukri means job in hindiI had a bunch of images opened in a bunch of tabs. I looked at this picture and didn't realise what the title was.

It was a very heartwarming moment.

Then I realised it wasn't real, just an advertisement, which was disappointing but just goes to show how effective this was!What was the response you got?Very clever. Good job.Thats some pretty amazing stuff... 
Where is this in India and when did you do it? What was the response from your tutor and friends? 

EDIT: Out of curiosity, I zoomed into the ripped off ads in the background realizing its for the IT tutor centre (NIIT) and from the address I could make out (Fatehsagar complex) I found that this picture is probably from area of Vadodara, Gujarat in India..  atleast one of my questions answered.. :)Was he hiding a wifi hotspot under that blanket?Can you get a job if you don't have a home?I work in marketing. Congrats on being a creative individual! Unfortunately all those lazy classmates of yours are going to become coworkers, bosses, etc in the future. I was creative too, until I got in the field. Great ideas are shit on in favor of crappy ideas. Higher ups are afraid of trying something new or spending money. Don't stop until you find the right company to work for. I made the mistake of working for a crappy company and now all my creativity and passion for the field is basically gone.It does imply that homelessness is solved by a job which is usually not the case. Often simply not having a home will prevent taking up a job offer and issues such as mental and physical health problems are usually key factors rather than finding the right advert. A major company would probably not use this advert as it oversimplifies and demeans a serious issue.TIL homeless people who live on the streets have internet access.I'm in the biz.  While I'm not familiar with the India market where this might not have any issues, I'd have concerns if someone presented this to me and I ran a job site in the US.

First, it would bring all the homeless support groups out in arms against the Client and agency.  Now, some might argue that any press is good press, but that is the kind of shit that gets an agency fired when the Client tries to distance itself from the situation.

Beyond that, it also would cause me branding concerns for the job site in question.  When people think of the homeless, like it or not, there are negative assumptions made about them, and also the level of job they are qualified for.  This could cause the site to lose interest from those posting higher-quality jobs as they might think ""well, they are targeting the lower end of the market, we are best off posting this elsewhere so we don't get that kind of applicant.""  Again, like it or not, that's the reality of perception.

Then there is the flip-side...the job seekers that would use the site.  If they are middle-class, they might see this and think the job site does not contain the kinds of jobs they would want to apply to, and thus cross it off their list.  They don't want to be compared to a homeless person--they want to be viewed as a confident professional who has a temporary setback and is using it to plot the next step in their successful career.First of all, I would like to say I love your ad and think it's very original.

What I'm going to say next is not directed at OP whatsoever, but is related to the OP's ad and I want to take this opportunity to get it out.  First, people somehow seem to associate a homeless person getting a job as an instant, magical transformation to living in a home.  Obviously, that is not the case.  A homeless person getting a job means they're going to have a home in X amount of weeks or months, provided they keep the job.

Second, do you realize how difficult it would be to GET a job as a homeless person?  Think about that for a second.  Let's assume you have no home, no car, no access to a shower (at least consistently), food is an issue, deodorant is an issue, clean clothing is an issue...and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  You have no address, so unless you lie on your application and the employer doesn't do a background check you're screwed.  You presumably have little to no money, and so you're balancing feeding yourself with keeping just clean/presentable enough to actually keep the job you just miraculously got.  Taking it one step at a time, you slowly buy the things you need to maintain your job and work toward saving enough money to get an apartment.  If you're lucky, eventually you persevere and ride off into the sunset in your brand new rented apartment.

Can it be done?  Of course it can.  But simply shouting ""Get a job!"" out of your car window at the bum lying on the pavement is fucking ignorant.  Thinking to yourself, ""Why don't they just get a job?"" is ignorant, too.  Because it's not that easy.  Far from it.  There's a whole list of obstacles and shit they have to deal with that I haven't even mentioned, and more likely than not they will have to do it step by step, succeeding at every one.

Most homeless people are ultimately responsible for the position they're in, that's undeniable.  But once they're there, it can be incredibly hard for them to dig themselves out, no matter how hard they try.  I don't think many people realize that.This is demeans the problem of homelessness. Yes some people are homeless and pull themselves up by their mystical bootstraps into poverty level income for awhile and then maybe *maybe* out of poverty. Other people are homeless veterans who can't get a job because they are scarred by war. One in four homeless people are veterans. They had a job, but come back home and find that they can't get the treatment they need or they can't find work to support themselves or their families because employers would rather hire the guy with all of his limbs intact. And then substance abuse becomes an issue largely because the support system that we have for returning veterans is not working. And then there are all the people sleeping on the street with mental disorders like schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder. Genetic conditions that require long term care. This whole ""get a job you homeless bum"" doesn't really pan out for them. 
This is in India. I get haunted by those java/j2ee tutor centers everywhereYeah, this ad is really gross.Wait...

My personal favourite at a marathon this year, from the husband of a runner: ""Jane, your blackberry is flashing"".I just spent a minute trying to figure out what ""para de"" was. I feel dumbOne of my brother's is an avid marathon runner (he's done over 10, I don't remember the exact number) but me and my other brother will often follow the route with a variety of signs including:

""I'm proud of you complete stranger!""

""Only 3 miles to go!"" (we would hold this one up at around the 5 mile mark)

""You're halfway there!"" (we would hold this one up at around the 24 mile mark)

""Don't look now, but I think somebody is following you!""

When I hold up a sign at a marathon it says Beer.  And I'm standing next to a table full of cups with beer in them.  I ran this marathon, the Half Moon Bay International Marathon! Those two were awesome. It was my first marathon, and the volunteers really make the experience so much better. There was a guy playing the bagpipes around mile 20, which was also cool. the kid biting the top of the sign is adorable for some reasonI read ""Parade"" as ""Padre"" and I thought he was saying his dad was the worst! I was thinking he was an awful child for a minute. Worst  
Kern ing  
EVER!I saw someone at a half marathon a few months ago holding a sign that said ""good news, Charlie Sheen thinks you're winning"".

I also liked ""If you're feeling bad, don't worry, that will change. If you're feeling good, don't worry, that will change"".""Worst parade ever!""  Freakin funny!!When I ran my marathon last year, the mile marker 25 was missing. It was severely depressing because I was like, ""THIS IS THE LONGEST MILE OF MY LIFE AND I WANT TO DIE.""""Worst Parade Ever"" for the win!I quit lurking to comment on this. That's my sister and nephew. What a surprise to see this!I like the way the little boy is clearly eating his sign out of sheer boredom.[The Beer Every Mile Half Marathon](http://exercisingwhileintoxicated.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/the-beer-every-mile-sf-half-marathon-13-beers-in-13-miles/)Last marathon I ran someone was holding a sign that said ""Chuck Norris never ran a marathon"".Looks like they have fun as a family. 

That said...this may have been risky.

probably from the Scottsdale marathon, I have run a few marathons but not this one.  My best friend held up a sign for me that said, ""Sssshhhh, we told her it was a 5k."" So sweet.I'm with the guy who remembered after two minutes that he'd forgotten he was too fat to run.

My parents are from a small town about a hour away from Porto. The last time I was able to go to Portugal was when my grandmother passed about a year ago. I was only there a few days but I was lucky enough that we had enough times for me to go to porto for the first time. 

 From my first impression of the city I thought it was pretty spectacular. The people we encountered were very polite and well spoken. The people in the city also seemed fairly happy from what I could tell based off of body language, facial expressions, and just plain choice of words.

 But what really amazed me was the city itself as it left a everlasting impression on me. When I'm in Portugal I always feel much more inner peace and just a sense of home there, but seeing and walking through Porto was really just something else. It's a beautiful city to me and I love the styles of architecture. Although there are buildings that are abandoned and falling apart (due mostly to children of previous owners of the properties having no interest at all in them from what I wars told), I feel that it only adds character. The look of the city resembles to me a fighter who gets beat up good, but remains on his feet through the blows.

 Last but not least if you ever send up there. Visit the city Gaia across the river and take a tour through a mock port wine cellar where they show you how port wine is made and at the end of the you you're given samples of almost any year you want to try with bottles to purchase as well after they explain the differences in the age. The view is also amazing from that side of the river.

TL;DR: havn't been to this place, but I can verify first hand that Porto is a beautiful city.

I think, for me, it reminds me of when things were slightly less complicated. I was in high school at the time and there was no war on terror going on. The economy was awesome and you could get gas for about a buck a gallon. All of this added up to having an awesome time, most of the time, and a pretty good feeling about the future. Austin Powers tapped into that all-around good feeling and rode the wave. I think if they were to try to put those same movies out today, they would not do nearly as well. In light of a decade of global war, economic recession and an  unprecedented stripping of civil liberties, people are just more cynical.

He had to have a ton of reconstructive surgeries just to be able to breathe properly. After he was able to survive on his own, they started the process of getting him a new face. Eventually they found a donor and were able to put the new face on. For a while his face was essentially useless except for making him look normal, as he couldn't move it properly and it wasn't fully integrated to his body yet, but the doctors said that eventually everything would attach correctly and even change with his body. By the looks of it, now, his face is attaching quite well.

Isn't medical science amazing? Let's not get into a pissing contest of ""And just hink how far we'll be if the fundies allowed stem cell research!"" or whatever. Just think about right *now*. Right *now* you can get an entire *face* from somebody else. You can get a new *heart* from someone else. Even prosthetics are getting better all the time. I think it's incredible, and good on this guy for getting a new face.That is amazing!

I mean not just the face transplant. But a new tongue. A new TONGUE!!!I like how the donor is anonymous.....BUT I CAN SEE HIS FACE RIGHT THERE!Wooo! University of Maryland!

There's a second shipwreck called The City of Grand Rapids next to this one that's mostly burned down but some of its ribs are actually sticking out of the water. My family owns a cottage that's in this picture and we visit it every summer for about a month. We used to own all of the land in this harbor back in the days of my dad's grandfather and he built cottages to rent out to tourists. It's an amazing place, the entire Niagara Escarpment is really beautiful. If you ever get the chance I would highly recommend visiting this area. Never thought I'd see it on the front page of reddit.  

edit: Yes you can dive this wreck but not go underneath the deck, and yes I have done it. You can dive down into the square holes in the duck, but not go underneath the deck because it's fenced off so divers don't drown if it did collapse (I think that's why the fence is there, or it would be so that divers can't damage the structural integrity of the ship, it's over 100 years old.)

The cottages are private and shared by my family and relatives.The rest that my great-grandfather built have been bought and demolished and new cottages have been built.

Edit: I'm glad you guys are watching this and it's getting some notice.  I think it's incredibly touching to see such honor and love come from something so sad.After our 15 month tour in Baghdad (May '03 - Jul '04) two of my Army buddies and I decided to ""road trip"" Europe for 30 days as we were stationed in Germany. Early in our trip we toured the beaches of Normandy and wound up in a bar in Caen later that night.  My buddy went to take a piss and inadvertently told the guy standing next to him at the urinal that we were U.S. soldiers 10 days removed from Iraq. This was just a few weeks after the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasion and word got out that there were American soldiers in the bar..... My buddies and I didn't pay for a drink the rest of the night! Vive la France!

And, a [better picture](http://halifax346et347.canalblog.com/archives/crash_sur_la_piste_d_elvington/index.html) of him from [this page](http://halifax346et347.canalblog.com/archives/crash_sur_la_piste_d_elvington/index.html)
I'm American; and my very first trip to Paris; my gf and I are taking the Metro (subway) and while she's French, it had been some time since she was in Paris and we were very lost.

This old well-dressed Frenchman heard us speaking American English; and asked if I was. He reached into his wallet, pulled out a tattered piece of blue material and told me a story that put tears in both our eyes.

That blue faded tiny material was from an American GI soldier who gave him a new pair of jeans in 1944 . He wore them until they fell apart, but kept a tiny piece of it.

He spoke about Nazis in Paris. 

He spoke about American solders in Paris.

He asked if my father was in the war, and when I stated he was US Navy and earned one of his Purple Hearts at D-Day.

He said, do me the honor of letting me thank your Father by helping his Son (me)

Let me be your guide the entire day as a thank you to him.

And he did. All day he showed us the real Paris, knowing people along the way, ending in dinner at a street bistro having wine.

I cannot begin to express what an amazingly charming suave man he was.

In my mental list of ""100 people I shall never forget""
I've just done some digging around and I think I've found some info on someone who *might* be Jean's father. It seems he flew in a [Handley Page Halifax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Halifax) in [No. 357 Squadron RAF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._347_Squadron_RAF) (a Free French squadron) at [RAF Elvington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Elvington) (as mentioned in the letter).

It looks like his plane was [H7-L ""L for Love""](http://p.v.free.fr/l_for_love/index.htm) ([same drawing different site](http://p.v.free.fr/l_for_love/raf_codes.htm)).

Finally [this](http://p9.storage.canalblog.com/90/68/520014/40484101.jpg) appears be a picture of Captain François Veauvy himself. And to top it off RAF Elvington is less than an hours drive from my hometown and I really need sleep now...That is awesome.

My experience with French people abroad is that they are friendly and classy as hell.

French people in France are another matter.I was traveling in France during the whole ""freedom fries"" nonsense after the start of the Iraq invasion, and while on a train my mother started talking to an old French man, as her French is much better than mine. She said something about how he must get annoyed by Americans sometimes and he responded by saying how he will always love Americans. He went on talking about how when he was a little boy his town was occupied by the nazis and when they were liberated by American soldiers it was the happiest day of his young life. 

tl;dr. The whole America/France spat is only perpetuated by those with no actual experience with the otherThere is a famous picture of a B-17 That was dropping food during operation chowhound which was food drops in The Netherlands. After a lot of searching they found the pilot of that plane and his crew. It was my grandfather. They flew him out to on the 50th anniversary, threw parades in his honor paid for everything. He went back a few times. He never mentioned he was coming. Somehow the government would find out, they provided limos, put him up in luxury hotels and never let him pay for a meal.

He passed away a couple of years ago. They have the picture up at the national air museum. It's huge. A documentary film maker donated his interviews with my grandpa and they play them there. We just called then up last week and offered them my grandpa's uniform which is in perfect condition. The old lady on the phone began to cry when she learned he had died and accepted his uniform to be paved in the front lobby on permanent display.

They called back a couple days ago. They are commissioning a bust of him as well. 
The thing is, my grandpa didn't seek to be a hero. To him the food drops where just a bright spot in a career he struggled with and the death he rained down on guilty and innocent alike. 

In the end it mattered more to the Netherlands than he ever realized. As a History teacher, I can honestly say that this is the first Reddit post that gave me goosebumps. I'll be sharing this with my students. History is a very real and meaningful thing. Thank you, sincerely, for posting this. 1. Classy paper
2. Penmanship is truly a dying art[deleted]The summer before going to college, I was roaming around Paris and I was trying to reach the Arc De Triomphe. But there was a large roundabout without about 5 lanes preventing me from reaching this Arc.

So I politely turn to a Parisian and I ask him how one goes about crossing this roundabout. I remember this word for word, he says ""Since you are American, you should try to run through these lanes.""

I look to him, he's dead serious not joking at all, so I step forward and I look at the cars coming around this roundabout and think damn this is going to be tricky. I then turn back and say, ""I'm pretty fast, but this looks dangerous.""

To which he replies, ""Of course it is, that's why most people realize there is probably a better way to do it, such as a tunnel.""



I'll never forget bicycling solo through Paris to Calais twenty years ago and for miles white crosses. I wept for miles. Thanks Teroc.Back in 2010 I met a very old, WWII veteran celebrating his 92nd birthday in Ruby Tuesday in the town where I grew up. He had a $108 beer tab and I paid for it anonymously. I hope he had a good night and is still alive. I have a lot of respect for people who went through war times to defend the freedom of many people. Such a selfless act.I have a similar story:

My father was in Paris some years ago and forgot the adaptor for his phone charger. He stopped by a store to pick up a new one and the old guy behind the counter recognized him as a foreigner. He asked my father if he was American and if his father (my grandfather) had fought in WWII. My father answered yes to both and the old man said, ""I was a boy when the Americans liberated Paris, for you it is free."" So much for all the French being assholes.Some times it seems like we need an alien invasion or something so we can make the world pull together in one direction for once... But we'd probably lose in a week and be forced into sexual slavery for the Procyons, and I really treasure my anal virginity...Such an amazing thing!

Just ignore those articles about the floods, we're on top of all that, no need to worry.Tears. What a wonderful tribute. =)Felt like I needed to chime in.  My grandmother and grandfather lived through NAZI occupation in the Netherlands.  Their brothers and sisters remained in the Netherlands after my grandparents became US citizens.  

On a visit to the Netherlands I was told I had to go to the Netherlands American Memorial in Margraten by my relatives.  I was taken to the memorial and my family explained that this land belonged to the US in memorial to the troops that died liberating the land.  

In a countryside where farmland is so vital that homes are built in tiny footprints there resides a 65 acre memorial and cemetery. 

I was already sufficiently blown away with the gesture when my uncle directed me to a grave.  That grave was important to our family... as a way of giving thanks our family pays to upkeep the grave and visits regularly to present flowers, flags, etc.  

Here it was approximately 60 years later and my family was still honoring a man they never knew who was shot down flying a bomber while trying to reclaim their land.  

They viewed what they did as such a great honor... I must confess dry air at the memorial caused a tear or two. No joke, reddit, I got tears in my eyes reading this message (and related story). It is the highest honor, when the son of the figher remembers the good fight, and honors, in his turn, the memory of his dad's fellow combatants. 

Monsieur Veauvy  Jr, you are a cut above others - chapeau!I used to hate on the French a lot when I was younger but don't anymore. As an American (as in citizen of the United States), I'm grateful for what France has done for the USA. The help they gave during the Revolutionary War was invaluable and they gifted us with one of our most endearing symbols: the Statue of Liberty. My mother tells me that the people of France were very kind to my grandfather while he was stationed in France during WWII.

Props to France and her people, and Vive la Liberté.It amazes me how every time something friendly is said about France, there is always some asshole from Butfuck Indiana, here to tell us all about how rude the French are and horrible Paris is.Just look at the way the French treat the Allied war graves. Some dickhead vandalises them, and basically everyone in France goes apeshit.

:0 I opened up this photo the exact moment I drove by it (I'm the passenger) It's shit like this that baffles me. Makes me want to think its more than chance, but I can't succumb to magic. The just put those in all the high schools in my city. Hopefully that helps the school budget crises. I used to have 3 8'X4' solar panels on my roof.  They all generated around 100W a piece on a clear sunny day.  At a continous rate they provided plenty of power to my fridge, A/C, and TV on a good day.  Unfortunatley my dumb ass installed them wrong and caused my roof to leak, so I had to take them down.  If I have a chance to do it again right, I totally will.Virginia Tech's parking garage does:

http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2012/02/020712-tcs-solarpanels.htmlWhere I live there are currently 12 of these parking lots installed within a 10 mile radius.  It is city law that any new parking lot be required to have solar panels!!!I bet that's Phoenix. We have those things everywhere. Not just for the power, but shade technology. We try to shade everything.My school William Paterson University does this.  For a brief time we had the largest solar panel field on any college campus.

http://cpronline.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/solarpanels.pngThe best side-effect of those panels would be sitting in a cool car instead of a super hot oven with molten wine-gums all over the place.Provided you're somewhere where the cost/benefit breakdown of large-scale solar power implementation is feasible. Case in point: St. John's, NL receives close to 2500 hours of fog per year, as well as snow, rain, overcast, etc. Leas viable. 

However, I agree with the sentiment. All ""wasted space"" like parking lots could be utilised to a greater purpose. Maybe a wind farm in lieu of a solar farm. But as a species, we need to concentrate on making cleaner energy sources more viable. The Cincinnati Zoo uses solar arrays to shade it's parking lot as well.  If i recall correctly that generates a significant percent of the power used by the zoo.

    arch like trees first planted
    then pulled up from
    their roots...

**Another glorious victory for mankind!**I met Lonesome George when I visited the Galapagos in 2007. Amazing experience.  At the time, they were trying to get him o mate with a couple of lady tortoises who were a very close species to his.  He was not having it. He was the equivalent of Walter Matthau shoved in a shell. Wow.  For some reason I never really thought he would die.  I always thought I would get to meet him.  Breaks my heart knowing that a subspecies just went extinct.  R.I.P George.  We'll miss you.Subspecies.Well that's freaking sad, I would have been his friend, and hung out with him... he'd be called happy george then.... ohgawdwhygood thing he probably lacks the capability of realizing how sad he should be. i can't imagine being the last of something; to never find a mate, possibly always looking for something just like you, but you're the last one and will die aloneCharles Darwin thought them to be marvelous creatures, and the observable differences between tortoises of different islands helped develop his theory of natural selection.

He also describes how his crew relentlessly slaughtered the animals to use as food. The continued hunt, in combination with human-planted goats eating their food led to them eventually being phased out.

Natural selection. Kind of a bittersweet irony.I was really hoping he'd keep kicking. At least make it to 150. Oh well. I saw we brush up on the cloning thing.

And everyone in the shop has concluded that that is one incredibly well built mold. Why do I have the impression that this piece of metal is worth more than me ?That'll do mold, that'll do.Recently, while walking through Target's toy section, I wondered 'Why is Lego so expensive?  It's plastic.'

Right.  Multiple precision-made, imported plastic bricks, with licensed brand names of popular movie franchises.Fellow person who worked in a mold shop. The small inserts I'm sure were CNC cut, but the real works comes after that as they need to be polished by hand by people who know WTF they are doing. 

Those brass pieces on the side of the mold are for cooling lines to quickly cool the mold so the pieces can form and can be ejected as quick as possible to start the process over. There are special brass baffles that help flow the coolant for better cooling. You'll also notice plugs on the side because two cooling lines had to meet using a drill, probably to make a loop around in and out of the mold.

The left half of the mold you'll notice two ejector pins on each lego insert in the middle. These pins are to eject the part after it has cooled. The pins are connected to an ejector plate which the molding machines controls and ejects the parts at the correct time. You will also notice there is a number stamp on each half of the mold. This is obviously to keep the two halves mated and not mix them up, they are built and fitted to mate with each other. Should a different half of a twin mold try to be mated together bad things would happen.

It looks like there are a couple alignment pins on the face as well as the leader pins.

The lego inserts themselves I'm sure are a different hardness and steel type to promote longevity of the mold.

You can see remnants of a white grease where the leader pins go in. This is a white lithium grease common to keep things lubed. 

It looks like most of the mold has been mirror polished, this is not typical and done just for show and presentation.

I've been out of the mold shop game for a while, my guess on the cost of the mold would probably be $50-60,000.

I assume the trajectories for Venus and the Sun would be fairly predictable, but, cool. I'm surprised at how profoundly I've been affected by viewing the transit. I thought it would just be sort of cool, but instead it provided me with a tangible sense of space wrt to the inner solar system. For the first time I really directly perceived (vs just knowing) that these are objects with distance between them rather than just points of light in a flat looking sky. I really feel like I saw Venus ""in front of"" the sun, or rather ""between us and the sun"" in a 3D sense, and I also got a sense of their relative sizes (I realize the distances distort that of course) that usually only comes from looking at pictures, but this time, came from looking at them directly.

http://i.imgur.com/7ICQd.jpgIn case anyone was interested, I spent most of my young life quite active yet got distracted and lazy towards the end of high school. When i was 19 I went in for a routine half-day surgery and ended up bleeding internally, requiring an iron infusion amongst other complications. At this point i weighed approximately 214 KG (470 lbs).

It was my wake up call, I decided to get fit. Three years later, I've completed a Double Degree in Marketing and Human Resource, Lived in the USA for (almost) a year (from Australia), traveled throughout Europe/Asia/USA twice and am the happiest I've ever been!

At my lightest in that period I got down to 71 KG (156 lbs), but currently weigh 110 KG (240 lbs) as I have been focusing on 'bulking' up. Unfortunately the 'latest' photos I have are from a few months ago, since then I've gained a substantial amount of muscle (photos to come, once taken).

edit: sorry my photos aren't the best, i was afraid of cameras for a long time - for legitimate reasons as you can see!

Still 5 hp left bitches![Video](http://www.flotrack.org/speaker/10571-Alicia-Follmar) [trip happens at 1:47]This happened a few years ago at Penn Relays in the DMR (distance medley relay) and was pretty crazy (especaily the fact that she still managed to beat a lot of people at what is considered one of the most prestigous meets in the country). She went to high school in my league and was kind of a ""legend"" in our area (high school state champion in California which is ridiculously difficult). In high school, she used to often run 4 distance events in one meet (mile, 800, 2 mile, and 4x400.. I believe sometimes she even high jumped!) just to get points for her team (something which may not have been so wise, but just showed how tough she was nevertheless). 

I remember talking to her a few months after this incident and she said that she didn't even ""feel"" the cuts/think about how bad it was, the adrenaline just made her get up and claw her way back to the finish. It got a decent amount of attention on the various running messageboards at the time and she was really humble about it, and said ""it was what anyone would do"", etc. Pretty cool.

For anyone interested in the video of the race: http://www.flotrack.org/coverage/250-2008-Penn-Relays/video/13687-W-DMR-H01-Event-58

edit: The funny thing is, in this very same league was another runner, Tori Tyler, who was also known for being really tough and who ran against Follmar quite a few times in high school and college (and was also a California state champion). At Division 2 nationals a few years ago, Tyler was near the front but after they came out of a wooded, icy area (it was snowing at the time of the race), she had fallen back a few places. She still managed to pass people and got 13th. Well, it turned out that when they went into that wooded area, she was tripped and fell and broke one of her ribs (and I think maybe her foot as well..) but got back up to finish and place pretty high. I've heard another story about how in high school, she would often run with the boys varsity team. One time she joined them for the usual 10 miler leading the group but was clearly in some unusual pain at the end of the run - turns out she had gotten her wisdom teeth out that morning..

edit: I saw that some people were also interested in what she was doing now (since this race was a few years ago), she is finishing up her studies at Harvard Dental school :)I just imagined her muttering ""fuck you, and you, and you, and all three of you motherfuckers"" etc. as she passed the other runners.Clearly practicing for a zombie run.If you think this is impressive wait until you read about the 2012 Olympics relay runner [Manteo Mitchell who ran half his stretch with a broken leg](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/09/london-2012-usa-relay-broken-leg).I really do wonder what went through her mind as she fell, and when she crossed the finish line in third place.I decided not to work out today because I hurt my elbow banging it against my door. dat determination[Original.](http://i.imgur.com/x0tA7.jpg)She went to my high school, shes a beastLooks like it could be a still from the Wadiyan Games.[deleted]What a fucking boss.You gotta wonder what the other racers who trampled her must be thinking.

**I summarised a lot of the [weekend's events on my HK blog](http://hongwrong.com/hk-handover/) and offered [an analysis for outsiders here.](http://hongwrong.com/july-1st/).**

I think a lot of folks would be shocked at the [record-breaking poverty gap] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-27/leung-faces-record-hong-kong-wealth-gap-as-city-s-new-leader.html) that has unfolded since 1997 in what is celebrated as the 'world's freest economy'. The WTO, Milton Friedman et al believe the city to be a model for everyone else but even the outgoing leader, Donald Tsang, admitted that trickle-down theory has failed the poor.

It was very hot out but [up to 400,000](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/30adabde-c364-11e1-ad80-00144feabdc0.html) people were clearly very angry today - I saw more colonial flags than on any previous [July 1st pro-democracy march.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1_July_marches)The best scene from the protests?

edit: This comment is a joke. The comment by the OP with more pictures and details about the protests isn't. They should have more upvotes. Looks like Hong Kong on any other regular day.HKSAR Establishment Day and Canada Day are the same day?You know what goes great with democracy? An ice cold Tsingtao.The Hong Kong police said that the number of people in the park at the beginning of the march had been 55,000. Organizers said that 400,000 people had participated in the march, including many who joined along the nearly two-mile route.

Surely this has no chance of success, right? Even with Hong Kong being one of the few places in China that could survive it alone. I love you, Hong Kong.I'm from Hong Kong and I was there this afternoon. This is just our annual protest on 1st July. But i would say not all people is asking for democracy. some ask for better policy for the disabled, some ask for better housing policy, some ask for the new chief executive to step down, some even ask for hong kong independency. today is just the day when everybody want to voice out their frustrationsGood luck Hongkongers! Hope you win your demand for democracy.This doesn't make any sense. The PRC reports that everyone there is happy and content...[deleted]They were outvoted by the millions that stayed at home.Where will the Chinese government put all the bodies?I've really appreciated your comments, you're obviously very passionate about HK's politics & its future. My wife is from HK, she left in 97 so I've always been aware of the drama of that time, & I've always found HK an extraordinary & fascinating place. 
Of course when I first went there 25 years ago it resembled in my mind a part re-creation of Bladerunner .. it had so much character, so much that was utterly fantastic & much that was chaotic - but exotic to me. Coming from a very middle class society it was strange knowing that for every Porsche-driving man there were many dozens of families living cheek by jowl in harsh cramped conditions. 
That's the way it seemed anyway but I never lost my fascination for its dynamism & it's ambitious people. 
The downside of the English rule was that many talented local people were often totally disregarded in the job market; the cushiest jobs going to English cliquish types & their heavy drinking mates. This was blatant discrimination & arrogance which caused a great deal of resentment. 
Now, goodness ..  you need to be a graduate, highly fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese & English .. in speech & writing. So that's a fair turnaround, but I guess the market is flooded with high achieving local graduates as well. 
I hope that HK will not be mired in China's crony capitalism & the influence of the well connected Princelings of Beijing .. but it's going to have to fight like Hell for that freedom. 
Best wishes for the future! 
That building looks like a giant WiiHong Kong doesn't have democracy?As someone who used to live in Hong Kong (in hong kong right now for summer vacation), and studies in Saskatoon, Canada (born in Edmonton) , 1st of July is an emotional day. But, even with that being said, I really really really think there should be a ""Vancouver burning their city over losing Hockey"" joke in here compare to the somewhat-not-so-violent-over-400-thousand-people protest in Hong Kong today which was actually for a serious cause. lots on remnants of Colonialism in this picture.

Mine look like mold.Every project is different but it is fair to say around $150/sf.  This includes full maintenance for a year.  Price/sf tends to go up the smaller the wall.  I know this sounds crazy expensive to us normal folk but it is cheaper than most and I think it looks pretty good.Do spaces with living walls tend to be quieter? due to the plants dampening effect; or noisier? due to the water recirculating.This one is using two layers of a non-woven industrial felt.  They are built in place and the water proofing is done with expanded PVC board.  The system recirculates and filters water and water is only added to replenish evaporative loss.Current civil engineering student here, I've been considering getting into green roof design once I'm done with school.

I've never seen any like that.Thats beautiful, have you made any living walls using common edible plants? when this hits the front page will you please do an AMA? It would make me happy and you would get more karma which technically makes it a win/win.What can $3,000 create for me?Awesome! I know some buildings have living walls as a 'sustainable' feature, for cleaner air or something. How do the sustainability benefits weigh against the impacts of what I imagine are high-powered electric lights? In other words... Living Walls: greening OR greenwashing?For a living.","{'Openness': 0.233, 'Analytical': 0.28, 'Sadness': 0.035501, 'Anger': 0.625134, 'Extraversion': 0.471, 'Joy': 0.17758, 'Agreeableness': 0.608, 'Emotional_Range': 0.848, 'Tentative': 0.613, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.16289, 'Fear': 0.291917, 'Conscientiousness': 0.153}",{'vegetation': 0.549834}

You mean you don't have to take a long journey on camelback through the desert to reach them? There go my childhood dreams.[Another Interesting Perspective](http://i.imgur.com/0OXJeDD.jpg)Imagine the unearthed ancient ruins under that city. There is an estimated  7 pyramids and over 200 more structures yet to be discovered in the surrounding area. I feel so ignorant when I see pictures like this. I can't believe I genuinely thought they were just out in the middle of desert somewhere.Let's just go ahead and ruin Stonehenge while we're at it.   http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/stonehenge_air.jpgHoly fuck they are hugeaaah fond memories of eating lunch on the Nile and seeing a dead horse float past.[deleted]Is that a golf course on the far left in the middle? Another thing they don't show you is in the desert just to the right of the smallest pyramid the ground is littered with dead horse carcasses.  They run horseback tours nightly through that strip of desert on basically half dead horses.  If they die on the trip they leave them there. The Transformers movie lied to me... I don't... my world is shaken right now...Its like the present impeding on the past, with no telling of whats to come in the future.From the pictures they usually show, [I always thought the pyramids were all the same size.](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mkw5102/GizaPyramids1.jpg)  I didn't realize one was much smaller.I can't believe i'm just now seeing this for the first time.  I'm amazed.I never knew it was like this. That is insane.Seeing them from that angle is really cool.At least we can still enjoy this. 

[Chichen Itza!](http://www.tri-statediving.com/Gallery/InternationalDiving/Cozumel/1997Cozumel/images/81%20Chichen%20Itza%20from%20the%20air.jpg)This is nuts. Talk about perspective being key, I had no idea at all that these pyramids were so close to a town. Why is this never mentioned by anyone, ever? Not like I ever would have cared, but, I honestly believed that this was far out into the desert and would have to take like a long bus ride from Cairo to get there. It actually makes me want to go there more, now that I know it's so close to the city.*poof* The magic is now gone. Good one OP.Speaking of history and commerce colliding:
I went to Egypt in 2000 and went all over the country. All of the monuments/pyramids/temples/tourist visitor places have gate areas you enter to go into them. Just outside the gates it is packed with people selling you all kinds of a trinkets, film, water, snacks, clothes. 

At the Great Pyramids (from this picture) there are kids that will wonder around and try to get in front of you when you take a picture then they will want you to tip them for being in your picture. Others will lead a camel over to you and offer to take your picture standing next to a camel in front of the pyramids.

I took the camel/pyramid pic because I thought it was cool, but I got annoyed when the kids kept trying to get in front of me when I was taking pictures.It looks so peaceful and clean in the photos. Go there and you will get raped in seconds. As soon as you enter the Pyramids area you will find camel/horse guys who will hustle you to buy a ride. Then, people will come to hustle you aggressively to take a tour with them. At the gates the policemen will ask for some grease on their hands. The ticket man will ask for some extra money in your pockets. When, you enter the pyramids area you will find everyone asking for tips. The same camel/horse story you got outside will be repeated for ten times. If you want to buy water or juice you will pay 10X the normal price. You won't orgasm. A few years back I was curious about this. I decided to pull up [Google maps](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=great+pyramid&hl=en&ll=29.981219,31.140146&spn=0.011096,0.019183&safe=off&hq=great+pyramid&radius=15000&t=h&z=16).

I didn't not expect the reality to be that I could hit one of the pyramids with a golfball, from a a golf course, with a solid swing.Has Cairo stopped growing? Or will it eventually flow around them?Yeah...I've been to the pyramids and have seen the reality there and it's pretty bleak. The pyramids are amazing, as expected, but Cairo is an absolute kip full of extremely poor people, people trying to prey on you or people out to harass you. 

This gets worse the closer you get to the pyramids.","{'Openness': 0.191, 'Analytical': 0.064, 'Sadness': 0.055206, 'Anger': 0.911492, 'Extraversion': 0.777, 'Joy': 0.044534, 'Agreeableness': 0.707, 'Emotional_Range': 0.631, 'Tentative': 0.636, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.473481, 'Fear': 0.158426, 'Conscientiousness': 0.159}","{'nature': 0.28905, 'ancient history': 0.937027, 'middle east': 0.942676, 'near east': 0.710949, 'levant': 0.710949, 'archaeology': 0.475021, 'desert': 0.310026}"

How is that even possible? That is carved out of marble? I wish I could see the process. There's a sculpture to this effect at the Minneapolis institute of arts also.As a sculptor this shit is incredible.  I sculpt in clay and can have it casted in bronze, the skill to turn stone into something like this is amazing.

One of my favorite's of all time, [stone to flesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Rape_of_Proserpina_1_-_Bernini_-_1622_-_Galleria_Borghese,_Rome.jpg) 

Bernini's Rape of Proserpina. Here is a similar one: [""The Veiled Rebecca""](http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/p/m/21ec9d/) by Benzoni, from Salar Jung Museum, Hyderabad, India.Speaking of awesome sculptors, my favorite was always [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini).

He's famous for making the marble ""come alive."" He's famous for doing the statues on top of the Vatican and is lesser known for some of his other famous pieces like [Apollo and Daphne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnEt-2xx-gY) and [The Ecstasy of St. Teresa](http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Bernini-Teresa-in-Ecstasy.jpg). The latter is absolutely my favorite. It's in a little church in the middle of Rome close to the train station. I'm not terribly into art but it is absolutely stunning the detail and the emotion that it invokes. Anyway, if you like this sculpture of The Veiled Virgin, definitely look into Bernini's work. He's amazing.[Took this at the Detroit Institute of Arts a couple weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/V1mV5YF.jpg)

She's not veiled, but the detail in her dress (the folds, the bow, the pattern along the hem) blew my mind.Fun fact from your crazy auntie Burlapin: Marble has a low index of refractive properties, very much like that of human skin- that's why human statues made of marble can seem to luminesce in the same way a person would.  

The surface plays with light the same way our skin does (and that's why it looks flippin' amazing to make humans out of).

Edit: holy shit, over half my total karma on the same commentRecently I have been renovating an office building, in particular the crawl space below the building removing duct work with a sawzall. This spot used to be a day care. When im down in the crawl space, which is pitch black aside from the flashlight I have, I imagine looking to my side and seeing a baby. My own imagination is starting to scare me down there, I think before we are done I am going to plant a baby doll peaking around a corner.

Just, the amount of shit that would be collected in my pants would be unreal if I saw this in my house.I did something similar to this once, on a very drunken night long ago I woke up with a parking meter in my bed.  Apparently after a night out with friends at a bar I had wandered off and walked home and somewhere along the way stolen a parking meter.  I kept it for a while and when it was time to move I decided I would hide it somewhere within the walls of the house.  There was a maintenance hatch in the bathroom that led into a little crawlspace, very tight and very dark.  So I decided to hide the parking meter inside there.  Now mind you parking meters have on board batteries that last for a very long time, I would pay very good money to see the face of the electrician who opens that hatch and sees the red ""expired"" light blinking back at him in the abyss.Don't tell me what to do floor!

He wildly opened the closet and then threw himself on the floor and looked under the bed.

I found out the next day when I had my glasses on that some former inhabitant had written on the ceiling in glow in the dark paint ""I AM UNDER THE BED""---coincidentally directly above where he had placed his bed, in some fucking scary ass horror movie style writing.

This reminds me of what happened in my subdivision a few years ago. A house exploded a couple of blocks away from mine. That was one crazy day but it got even crazier when it was revealed that the owners were also entrepreneurs in the sex toy industry. Tons of dildos were found in the debris. They were actually setting up for an adult convention about a hour away when it happened. 

Then of course, we found out the house was being foreclosed on and the owners did it on purpose. Thanks for raining dildos down on us.

-NeighborsCoke + Mentos. Never again.Does anyone know if the gas company has a way of monitoring gas usage within homes for emergency purposes?

For example, in a home my friend bought, the water company shut off the water because they were able to determine an irregular amount was being used when it was being shown off by realtors. Likely, someone came to view the home, turned on a faucet, and left it running when they left for some reason.

If a neighbor just opens the gas valve inside their house and leaves it running, can the gas company detect irregular usage? Or would it be too late before it mattered? Like I imagine some people use the burners on their stove for maybe an hour or two at a time if they are doing heavy cooking. Would that be enough time to fill up a house with gas, but at the same time, not be enough time for the gas company to notice something is wrong?Drone strike.

Then some bitch slapped me on the ass and I spent the rest of the day wrapped up in a blanket.  It was a good day.I feel like that's the true embodiment of America. Not the fat stupid arrogant image we have today. A foreigner, loving the country and what it is about coming here and become one of us. That's been America's history forever and I think images like this really capture what America is about. 

It gives me the smiles. This guy is more American than most of the natural born citizens. A man who values his citizenship, the look on his face says it all. You are the man Arnold.

The guy should be allowed to run.I don't care what people say about Arnold... being a ~~shitty~~ super duper governor or fathering illegitimate children... he's still pretty much at the top of the list of badasses.  I mean even as a ~~shitty~~ super duper  governor, he still managed to pull it off with little political experience and didn't completely destroy the state.   And even though he cheated on his wife, he didn't toss that lady to the curb, he paid to raise the kid and didn't go on denying it was his to the point of paternity tests and all that shit.  

He made action what action is today and still never took himself too seriously.  Arnold's just a pretty cool guy despite his flaws.""Aye loaf dis corn tree!"" -ArnoldMy new desktop background.The best part of this story is that the epic asshole known as Karl Rove told him he couldn't become governor of California.  Rove wanted to put Condoleezza Rice in the governor's mansion.

Clearly, Arnold disagreed with this line of thinking.

That right there gives me hope that there are no all powerful super villains in American politics.

I hope this gets big I hope one day I can celebrate this day - been wanting this since I was 11 .... I am 26 now, and I tried so many things, yet - still hasn't worked out. Turning 27 in about 3 weeks. Gah. I wanna make it before I die :) Good Luck to everyone who loves America. And GO OBAMA :) Needs more flag.This is exactly how my job acted when it went to Mexico.My mom did the same thing.  We had the gaudiest american party ever.It makes sense why Arnold would be into his maid, Mildred, over his wife Maria. Arnold is an immigrant. Mildred is an immigrant. Arnold has an accent. Mildred has an accent. Arnold had to work hard to get to where he is, literally doing the heavy lifting, day in, day out. Mildred likewise had to work hard with her hands, she scrubbed toilets on her hands and knees all the way to the governor's mansion.

Maria Shriver, on the other hand, never had to lift iron that would callous her hands. She never had to scrub someone else's filth. At face value, it would seem like the woman named Maria would suck a better dick, but Arnold knew that Mildred knew the value of hard work. He knew they shared the immigrant experience, he knew that they shared so much more than he did with his own kids. Dare I say, Arnold could have loved Mildred.

Having watched a number of old Arnold Scwarzenegger movies, I can confirm that frequently the female lead opposite to him would be Latina. In Total Recall, he leaves Sharon Stone for Melina. In Predator, he protects a Latina woman when he tells her to ""Get to de choppah!"" And finally in The Running Man, who does he star opposite but Maria Conchita Alonso? I believe he's always had a thing for Latina women, and found a kindred spirit in Mildred.  

However, in the end Arnold begged for forgiveness and wants Maria to take him back. His legitimate kids think he's a loser, while his illegitimate son may ironically come to respect and model himself after him. He started the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, a kind-of Clinton Global Initiative-like maneuver. In short, he picked power and ambition over the potential for love. He might have glimpsed true happiness in the dark, hushed, pumping against the kitchen counter for an instant, but he gave it up because in the end, he cares more about what people think.  

TL;DR Don't be like Arnold, go after your Mildred.would you fuck me?

A child was recently removed from his home due to abusive parents and placed with other family members.  They visited him, gave him a phone he could use to call them if he got scared or needed to talk, and then they camped out on the front lawn in a big group so he could rest easy knowing his parents wouldn't be able to get to him.Bikers Against Child Abuse started in Utah and is now international, and in most states in america. 

You can find a state listing here: http://bacaworld.org/chapters/united-states/

The mission statement with full information on what they do and don't do is here: http://bacaworld.org/mission/

If you know of a child who is suferring from abuse or who is going through the court system, please contact a local chapter of BACA.From their ""contact"" page:

Awesome. I want Slambo on my side.That is beyond awesome.In Sacramento there's a biker gang that blasts smooth jazz. I encountered them last night.I've always found bikers to be pretty decent guys, I just wouldn't want to owe them any money.When my counselor told me about this, I cried. I have a friend who's family is one of the chapters in Texas. It's awesome. 

Idk if anyone else has mentioned it yet, but they'll have someone drive up and down your street all night if you're afraid your abuser is going to come and hurt you etc., and can't sleep at night because of that and the like. Another chapter of the same group comes into my work often (a bike shop). They told me they often attend hearings and just stand there to look foreboding; just to support the kids help them feel like they have some protection.  More images: http://imgur.com/a/nxaUB#0

EDIT: To the responses about how they are not a biker ""gang"", I am well aware of that. However, the local media here called them a gang to catch the attention of the people and to make them look more tough. I am aware that they are a motorcycle club, which is why I put ""biker gang"" not biker gang. They are an  international organization and completely amazing. I was fortunate enough to volunteer at one of their events. Nothing like seeing those ""big scary bikers"" just melt into the kindest people you would ever meet. I made a reddit account simply because I saw this post. Yay or no longer being a lurker.
I am currently becoming a member of BACA. Thanks for the support of BACA!B.A.C.A is an international [organization](http://bacaworld.org/chapters/) They do amazing work for people. They don't only do stuff with child abuse, they also will protest the westboro babtist church and and rev their [engines loudly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_vouoE-DhE) so that the funeral goers don't have to hear their insults.I think I'm going to cry a little.according to Handkerchief code that guy likes Fisting.This part from the article is where the onions started getting shredded:

Pipes recalls going to court with an 8-year-old boy, and how tiny he looked on the witness stand, his feet dangling a foot off the floor.

""It's scary enough for an adult to go to court,"" he says. ""We're not going to let one of our little wounded kids go alone.""

In court that day, the judge asked the boy, ""Are you afraid?"" No, the boy said.

Pipes says the judge seemed surprised, and asked, ""Why not?""

The boy glanced at Pipes and the other bikers sitting in the front row, two more standing on each side of the courtroom door, and told the judge, ""Because my friends are scarier than he is.""

My uncle was in this! He now gives speeches at elementary schools about staying safe and speaking up if they are abused! I love BACA and my amazing uncle. I think he still has the jacket, at least he did when I last saw him like 3 years ago.Two of my good friends are BACA members, one is of fairly high-rank in our state chapter. Maybe I could finagle an AMA out of one of them?

EDIT: I think I have piqued their interest. Updates to follow. My boyfriend met them and is an unofficial member. They gave him a cross made out of two small stakes and said ""come back when you have a bike."" He has it hanging in his car. I love that there are people out there who will take stand for those who cannot.A throwaway account of course. I am a patch member of a motorcycle club possibly in Utah. The guys at BACA are some very decent people. There was a member of another club here in town that his daughter had been molested by her grandfather for years. She finally came out to her father. There was a court battle against the grandfather where BACA fully supported, and paid for the attorny. They also of course attended the court hearings as did 60~ members of various clubs in town. The support was immense.

Not all motorcycle clubs are bad. You just have to show them respect and you will get it in return. If you ever meet a patched member, there are a couple things you should know.

*Treat them with the utmost respect.

*Ask them if you may call them by their club name or real name.

*Never touch one of them without permission.

*Do not touch, or sit on their bike without permission.

*If you ant a picture with them, or their bike, ask first.

And to some people here, loud pipes really do save lives. We don't make our bikes loud just because. One of the reasons is that most people do not watch out for us on the road. The louder your bike is, the more noticeable you are. So on the highway if you have stock pipes on your bike, people cannot hear you. So if they didn't notice you were there, they can't hear you are there and can swerve right into you.Level 1 Intervention

Will consist of the organization deploying a ride, uniting as many BACA members as are able to attend. We will ride as a group to the childs house where the parent(s) / Guardians will be present to assist us in presenting the child with a patch, stickers, and a photograph of the child with his/her new biker family. If the child is afraid, it is our hope the child will use the photograph as a comfort to convey the message I am not alone, and you dont want to mess with my family.

chain_divider

Level 2 Intervention

If Level one is not sufficient to deter further abuse or harassment, several BACA members will be sent for further exposure. This group of BACA members will create a presence at the home of the child, being visible at times when the family might be the most vulnerable. The purpose of BACAs presence is to deter further abuse and to protect the children and the family, if necessary.

chain_divider

Level 3 Intervention

If the physical presence of our BACA members at the residence of the childs home does not deter the abuser, a formal letter will be drafted by the Chapter President or Vice-President in the area in which the abuser lives. This letter will be written on BACA letterhead. The substance of the letter will be to explain to the perpetrator that we are prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to become the obstacle to further abuse.

chain_divider

Level 4 Intervention

While it is against the purpose of BACA to purposely engage a perpetrator, we will ask for the general geographical location of the offender, and conduct a Neighborhood Awareness Ride in which we will ride to the general location given to us and go door to door letting people know who we are, hand out stickers to kids, and distribute our literature regarding our mission and how we function. If the location or address of the perpetrator becomes known to any BACA Member, we will immediately withdraw our physical presence to avoid any contact. BACA does not condone, support or participate in the use of aggression, violence or physical force in any manner. If, however, ANY person should seek to inflict harm on one of our BACA Members, we will respond with commitment and loyalty to protect our Member.

chain_divider

Our Court Appearances

We also attend court with our wounded friends. The sole purpose for our physical presence is to assist the child in being less intimidated and frightened, and subsequently give an accurate testimony regarding his/her abuse. If the child requests our presence in the courtroom, the parent or guardian for the child must petition the childs attorney, who then will intercede on behalf of the child to the presiding Judge. Absolutely no physical confrontation of the perpetrator will be tolerated by BACA, and anyone acting in such a manner will be acting outside of the scope of BACA and will be held completely and solely accountable for his/her actions. When possible, the two bikers assigned to the child as his/her primary contacts should be in attendance. Given that it is not always possible for the primary contact bikers to be in attendance, a petition may be made to the general membership for their attendance and support. A listing of the court dates and times will be kept and updated on the BACA hotline at all times.










Sooooo much awesome..OP left out the best part.  That photo is from a super long, super awesome article about the group.

I encountered them last night.holy shit why is the logo a big fucking fist coming at the viewer?

""when the kids see this logo, i want them to think about getting punched.""

LOLI don't know why but this has me crying like a baby. [I love this post!](http://imgur.com/IbLml)My dad was a biker. I was always amazed people thought all bikers were tough and mean, because my dad and all the bikers I met through him were kind, gentle, great people. Most of the people in his group were married and had children of their own, and they never showed me or anyone else in my family any less than the utmost respect. My dad used to go on toy rides where they'd deliver Christmas toys to needy children and other charity rides for people in the community. 

When my dad died last summer, many his biker friends rode hundreds of miles to attend his memorial service and gave us a beautiful flower arrangement. They also raised $3,500 to help us with his final expenses. I will never forget their kindness; it was truly amazing.

The majority of bikers aren't like the Hell's Angels, they're just people who like to ride, and their motorcycles give them a common bond that makes them friends in a way unlike many other groups.","{'Openness': 0.224, 'Analytical': 0.362, 'Sadness': 0.058575, 'Anger': 0.995624, 'Extraversion': 0.895, 'Joy': 0.062146, 'Agreeableness': 0.784, 'Emotional_Range': 0.715, 'Tentative': 0.561, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.07113, 'Fear': 0.82646, 'Conscientiousness': 0.102}","{'people': 0.268941, 'sport': 0.689974}"

Once a bottle got too expensive, at around a hundred dollars for a 750, it was under lock and key, but we had tons of cheaper stuff locked away.

Ever notice that gas stations in the inner city tend to be more likely than suburban and country stations to have bullet-proof glass between you and teller? As someone who has worked in retail I can say this was most likely not racially motivated but from ""scanning outs"" with one of those big black(giggity) electronic guns you see in stores.

At least a couple times a week a sales associate is instructed to go through different sections in a store and use this gun to scan empty spots on shelves. The results are then sent to the main office which shows what items are out of stock from selling them and out of stock from theft.

Items that are habitually adding to ""shrink""(monetary loss from theft) are put on a list to have extra security.

I worked at Advanced Auto Parts(which is a great company to work for for anyone looking for a job btw) and our extra security mesasures included

1. Securing high-risk items with a zip tie to the shelf
2. Placing high-risk items behind metal cage hidden behind one of the main counters.(These items are mostly stereo/sound equipment.)




When a product is habitually stolen it is common practice to implement further safeguards. The Magnum condoms are kept in a vault 3,000 feet below Sea Level. They HATE the sea. Black Tim Curry is creepy...Tangentially related point:

The reason this gets stolen more, is that it's the same texture as pubes, and *nobody* wants gray pubes...Ask any Sally's employee.

Oddly enough I found this out after visiting a store and noticed that EVERY BRAND of black hair dye had a sticker that said ""purchase at register"". Dunno why but it is. Because all black people are thieves.
/r/thanksobama The black to white ratio around here is like 50 to 1 or some shit, but the local Dollar General got rid of their black hygiene products because of theft.  They'd be stolen within hours of being put on the shelf, and every single time they'd review the security tapes it would be a different black person coming in and walking out with like 5 of each product.

Source: Friend that works at that store.Pretty simple: What gets stolen frequently gets put in a box.
You people can try 50 different reasons which all amount to you screaming 'racism', but I assure you having worked in retail, this is the case.

Jesse Jackson Jr. probably shops at this store.

The 'star' shape to the stump indicates that the tree had been fighting off heavy infections (probably fungal, or insect) for a very long time. See the dark inner rings? The tree was infected when it was that size, and has been fighting ever since. Odds are the structural integrity of the stem was in question (or the tree had straight up lost the fight), and the foresters, or whatever your campus has, made the call to cut her.

Nothing lives for ever, not even trees. Those in urban environments have drastically reduced lifespans as it is, due to exposure to a less than ideal growing condition, pollution, damage from humans, etc. This tree lived a full life (albeit one where it spent the latter half of it fighting for its life), so don't worry too much. 

**edit** I base the above on my knowledge of trees in Eastern Canada, and fully admit that there could be species elsewhere in the world that just naturally grow in this pattern, due to their root structure - I just don't have first hand knowledge of them.isn't that rotten tissue in the centre (the dark brown), and then dead tissue (the light brown), and the living tissue is just the green bit under the bark?   from what i remember of biology, the 'wood' bit of trees is all dead tree.you should post this to [r/marijuanaenthusiasts](http://www.reddit.com/r/marijuanaenthusiasts). In all seriousness, /r/marijuanaenthusiasts is about actual trees.The dead tissue in the center looks like a leaf. Do you have a picture of the tree before it was cut down?Wow, I'm just thinking that having a slice of it would make a gorrrrrgeous and handy platter plate! 
Tomatoes on one end. Cheese, ham, pineapple on the other ends plus any dip in the centre. 
I'm just shocked and amazed that it was cut so smoothly; normally there would be garish chainsaw marks, or at least a few different angles to the cut. It's a dog eat dogwood.As an engineering student who took biology for a little bit all I can really say is.. does anyone else feel that plant cells are a lot more badass than animal cells? Sorry just had to ask.What campus, if you don't mind me asking? Dude, gore tag!Did you know that most of a tree is dead in the first place... without that fungal infection?Tissue? It's still in wood form. It would be amazing if this was a maple tree, given the leaf shape left in the middleNot sure about how maple trees rot, but I know when a fir tree looks like that on the inside, the smaller branches near the top loose their needles first. Then they start loosing more needles until the top dies. Wonder what that tree looked like before they cut it down.Looks like some form of modern art.Reminds me of a lot of my exes.  :-PThe living part of the tree is actually only the part with the bark on it. Was it cut down with a lightsaber, because that is a *clean* slice.It must've been in a relationship to be that dead insidehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G880gxjj9dI&feature=player_embedded&noredirect=1Greetings from a fellow UC Davis redditor!

I take over 12 hours to smoke meat the old fashioned way - building a fire to make coals and shoveling them into the smoker. I trim and season the meat before hand and take a lot of time hand pulling the meat. Trust me - doing it right is very hard to balance the flavors. It should never just taste 'smokey' you should be able to pick up the hints of the wood. Congrats and thank you for enjoying our food. Food will lead us to world peace.  I say we airdrop some ribs and pulled pork into Israel....oh....wait.....That reminds me of an interview of Stephen Fry (an English comedian/host) I once saw.  He did a series of documentaries for the BBC about the each state in the USA a few years back and then was promoting it.  He said when he first came to the USA he thought ""How are so many people in the USA so fat?"".  When he left the USA after driving across the country for a month or two he thought ""How is anybody in the USA thin?""Oh fuck, I'm hungry now... that looks SO GOOD!  Pulled pork sandwich... mmm.You don't even know. That's just the surface. Have you ever had true pan-fried chicken from somewhere in the South?

Nothing goes better with Pork, than Pork

Pork on Pork

The funny thing, is almost every Southern State has their own special variation of the pulled pork. The North Carolina vinegar type is particularly delicious. Add some Texas brisket to that list and your journey to the dark side will be complete.Whenever someone says there is no such thing as american food, I always say BBQ baby!  It's no exaggeration to say no other country does it even close.Best thing about barbeque is that it's different everywhere in the country. Louisiana has a different style than Tennessee, which has a different style than New Mexico. And they are all FUCKING DELICIOUS. GET INSIDE ME PORK. NAO. You're missing the rest of the meal, where are the beans, Mac n cheese, coleslaw maybe some corn. Everyone is talking about BBQ itself, but I think they are also forgetting something: everything else that goes with BBQ. 

Who in America doesn't know about BBQ's. Whether done at a gathering or alone. I love to waste away a summer day tending BBQ with a beer in hand. Among family, children, friends, hotties in tank tops and short shorts, music going, beer in solo cups, horseshoes, fireworks, maybe a ball game on the radio. 

It's not just the food, it's everything that also goes with the food. It's beautiful, it's fun, it's America.

I'm late to the party, so I imagine this will get buried.

I'm Korean.  I had an aunt and uncle, who got married prior to the outbreak of the Korean war.  They were apparently very much in love, and lived in what is now North Korea.  When the war broke, my uncle went to fight for the South.  After the war, he received word that his wife had perished at some point during the war.  Heartbroken, he lived out the remainder of his years in South Korea.  He never remarried.

In 2005, my uncle, grandfather and father were contacted by a Korean agency that works to reconnect families separated by the war (I think the Korean Red Cross).  They had found my Uncle's wife, alive in North Korea.  My father and grandfather, who live in the US, immediately boarded a plane for Korea, where they met with my uncle.


Like the original photo, the three of them were given the opportunity to cross the border for one day, to meet with my aunt.  She had also never remarried.  They spent that one, bittersweet night expressing to one another that they had never stopped loving each other, then had to part ways the following day.Let me urge Redditors to read two books: ""Escape from Camp 14,"" about the only person known to have escaped from a particular prison camp in North Korea, and ""Nothing to Envy,"" which tracks the stories of six defectors to South Korea.  Both are fascinating and disturbing, and they will underscore the fact that the world should not ignore what North Korea does to its people.That feel knowing that is the last time you will see a loved one.  This makes me sad. Many families were split when the country/ies divided. Even worse if you leave North Korea, your family left behind will suffer terribly. Everyone from your wife and kids to your uncle and grandparents.  I work with a Korean girl in her late 20's early 30's and I asked her about the situation since shes only been here a few years.  She said that most South Koreans don't really want the Unification anymore.  They are afraid of losing jobs and having to support the North.  She explained that most of the people with family in the North are dying out so the sentiment keeps losing steam with newer generations.  She said they also have a different dialect, or accent now so it seems as different as us and England.  If the north falls, the south may not want to take it back.my grandfather went to his deathbed not knowing whether any of his siblings were still alive in North Korea.

makes me wonder if he would have rather had the chance to meet his siblings again, even if he knew that they had to go back to that nightmare of a place to our north.Are you sure it's not the other way around? The man waving on the bus looks very well-fed and healthy, as does the woman behind him. Not to mention that he's wearing a western-style suit.

The man crying looks to have had a much harder life, which is consistent with conditions we know exist in N. Korea (food shortages, etc).An international Korean student at my school made a speech today about the importance of the reunification of Korea. She hopes to return to Korea and educate young minds about the power of unification after she completes her education in America. I was really inspired by this message and I hope she (or someone before her) will change the world. Of course he looks smug. He's going back to BEST KOREA!This shit is going to make me cry, for real.  When I was in South Korea I took the DMZ trip, there are entire of buses of elderly South Koreans who take the bus as far north as they get to go and just sit, because it's as close as they'll get to their relatives.  There is an entire complex built for family reunification on the South Korean side of the DMZ that goes unused because the North knows better then to let anyone cross sides.  I'm overcome by guilt looking at this picture. My grandparents were saving their money for my grandfather to reunite with his three siblings who might still be alive in North Korea.. But they gave it to me so I could continue school because American tuition is ridiculous. My grandfather says it was well spent, but he's already 83 and I might have taken his last chance to see them. I miss my grandparents, thanks for posting this I'm going to call them tonight. If you have Netflix Instant, the 50-minute ""National Geographic: Inside North Korea"" is a very insightful look into the country and its people.Do you know the word 'Han' in Korean? This is it. Found the quote : ""There is no literal English translation. It's a state of mind. Of soul, really. A sadness. A sadness so deep no tears will come. And yet still there's hope.""
Obligatory suggestion that people interested in learning more about life in North Korea and what it's like for people who escape read [Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/)What struck me about this picture, is how human it is.  It doesn't need words, it doesn't need captions or circumstance.  It's not what makes him unique from us that sticks out, but what is common and connected and one.  The elderly often strike me like this, as having stories in all of their wrinkles and being very beautifully human.Makes me think of how lucky I truly am. Great post. Thanks for sharing this.Imaginary lines creating bullshit worldwide.What scares me most about the human race is we have such compassion but a few people can suppress it with politics. I can't imagine how many years it had been since they had seen each other and only getting to spend such a short amount of time together. Old and weathered they lived to see each other, probably some of the only people who have cared about them for so long in life. They lived to see each other and depart. Our politics are more concerned about who owns land than who loves each other.These pictures brought out a lot if emotions in me. I feel terrible living the life I am, while these people struggle everyday knowing that that is the last time they will ever see their relatives. It's terrible. As much as I love the pictures too, I also feel as if I were one of the people crying and emotionally upset, the last thing I would want is my picture being taken when I am emotionally unstable. So terribly sad as an American seeing people around the world having to put up with this. Wish them all the best of wishes!I am actually raising money for LiNK ( Liberty in North Korea). It is an organization that help rescue the people of North Korea. My goal is to raise $30 however, you can also donate directly to LiNK. A $10 donation for the cause would be wonderful. However, if you can not donate but want to help you can go to LiNK's website and start your own fundraiser or just spreading the word would be amazing as well.

[the link to the main page](http://libertyinnorthkorea.org)I remember the ""No Reservations"" Anthony Bourdain episode when he went to Korea and met a man who had crossed the border during the war. I remember not really reading the subtitles, but crying at the obvious heart break the man expressed. It was very poignant how he was eating at this restaurant that wasn't that far from the river he crossed, and how life was for him there, in the North, but how it was for the folks that he left behind and who didn't make it... it was really quite powerful. He can never go to his hometown, he left his parents and everyone behind because he knew to make it out, but he was still Korean. My heart goes out to all those on the peninsula. It's really tragic that family members have been forced to split apart due to something that seems almost trivial when compared to the emotion conveyed through this imagedamn thats a powerful picture.I saw a documentary once on the bloods and the crips. Tookie Williams actually once brought lost family from both gangs and put them in a room together. The room was divided red and blue. After about 10 minutes of hardcore staring, two cousins, one in each gang, dropped their shit and hugged each other, which started a whole extravaganza of brothers, fathers, sons, cousins all reconciling with each other. Sadly once they got back on the street, they went back to their old gangs. It's truly sad how deep rooted ideals, beliefs, and traditions run, and how they can tear people apart. Who knows, maybe one day those very traditions that drive people from each other will work as a driving force in the reuniting of lost family from many generations down the road.

Is it that alligators are so high in the food chain that stereoscopic vision for hunting is of no value to them and they can rely on wide angle of vision for spotting potential prey and just exploit that?

Murder of crows!The military was doing some experiments in the mountains...Crow researcher here!

While I don't particularly think these are crows, due to the very narrow heads I can make out from the semi-blurry picture, I feel OBLIGED to comment on this!

I think these are grackles, who also roost together in huge numbers.  For those commenting that they have seen crows do this, I am extremely interested and happy to see people have noticed this phenomenon!  My current research project is tracking and studying these gigantic roosts of birds and seeing their ecological impacts.

For crows, in the northeast where I am researching, this phenomenon happens mainly in the winter.  The vast majority of birds are not local birds, but migrants from Canada.  They may join up with local birds to roost, think of it like a massive slumber party.  Younger birds are more likely to join up, too!

During the breeding season (here's a [picture of a baby crow](http://i.imgur.com/YJYNi.jpg) that I tagged in the spring), crows have rigid territories, usually with less than ten birds, but during the winter, these territories temporarily break up.  With the amount of bird that come down, defending these territories becomes impossible as your summer territory may become invaded with 40,000 competitors.  So they just go with the flow.  Literally.

Of course, people don't particularly WANT a crow roost in their back yard.  Where I am studying them, people have done a lot to try to eliminate the birds presence, usually through loud noises, firecrackers or lasers.  Some of these roosts will fragment and relocate to other parts of the town or even other cities.  There are also very serious efforts to shoot and kill crows, mainly due to a large misunderstanding of crow biology.  There are a lot of misconceptions, such as their ability to spread disease or their ""overpopulation"" according to many non-experts.

Some of the local birds our group has tagged have been found in roosts hundreds of miles away for the winter and then return right back home for the breeding season!  Really incredible stuff!  

Here's a photo of me holding one of the birds tagged during the winter.  [We attached a radiotracker backpack to this bird and tracked her all winter.](http://i.imgur.com/ZNpXL.jpg)  She eventually was found dead of West Nile Virus in the spring.

[Here's a photo I took last week of the crow roost coming in for the night in Auburn, NY.](http://i.imgur.com/CRovX.jpg)

If people are in the New York/Pennsylvania area and have seen these roosts, feel free to PM or leave a message here letting me know (specifically) where you saw them, and I just may come check it out!  You'd also be helping science!  

Feel free to let me know if anyone has questions, too, I'd be glad to take a swing at them!13 daysI've seen enough Hitchcock to know how this ends.Whatever you do... Do not try and hide in a phone booth...

>Sure. Here's what happened:

>It was Sunday at Austin Wizard World Con. I had the flu, and almost missed this photo session. Though I had a fever and no cowbell, I sat there and smiled for everyone as best as I could, grateful that I'd spent the entire night throwing up so there was nothing left in me to vomit all over the fans like I was cosplaying from the Exorcist.

>The way this sort of photo session works is pretty standard: people come in, stand next to Patrick, say a few words, and then we all pose for the picture. Each person is there for less than half a minute (which I think really sucks because of how much they pay for the opportunity, but is pretty much the only way we can manage the hundreds of people who usually sign up for these things.)

>About 30 minutes or so into this particular session, these two people came in. The girl went to stand between Patrick and Frakes, and the guy directed her to stand in the front, instead. All of us tried to figure out what was going on (usually it's small kids who come to the front, usually sitting on Brent's lap or Gates' lap), and the guy said, ""I really love Star Trek, but I love [her name] even more."" He got down on one knee, and proposed to her.
Marina started to cry, I felt like I was going to cry, and we all applauded and celebrated when she said ""yes."" Apparently, they'd met Marina earlier in the day, and Marina had given him shit for not marrying her, so Marina was embarrassed about that.

>I'm not sure why this picture is being circulated online, like Patrick is giving the literal Picard Facepalm, because that's just not what happened. We were all delighted for this young couple, and I know that I was honoured to be part of this moment in their lives. I think it's likely that Patrick was just wiping sweat off his brow or something like that.
It wasn't awkward, other than that moment when everyone except the guy had no idea what was going on. Once we knew what was happening, it was awesome. I'm incredibly happy for these people, and I love that I got to be part of what is hopefully a moment they'll celebrate and remember for the rest of their lives.I like this picture, everyone looks much happier from the first one.

Except Levar who just looks slightly less annoyed. He has the same look I get when thinking ""Damn, everyone else is clapping. Guess I better clap too. But I hate clapping.""It looks like Frakes thinks they are just the most PRECIOUS THING EVER!LeVar Burton is staring at that chick's tits.

[""FUCK SHiT FUCK""](http://i.imgur.com/hpayX.jpg)I remember reading that due to the spilling oil, it was difficult to remain anywhere near it, the oil was fouling the air to such an extent as to make it difficult to breathe.

The photos are incredible.  I wonder how awful it *sounded* as well.  Twisting steel only a mile or so away.Dammit Cloverfield! Stop destroying shit!This will get buried, but I was just reading about the [Piper Alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Alpha) rig that burned in the North Sea in 1988. 

A pump was switched on without a safety valve, and the resulting explosion and fire killed *167* of the 228 men on board. 

[Here's video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdRcALtA8CE) from a firefighting boat during the event. At this point men are still on the rig. In fact months later they recovered the galley section from the ocean floor, inside they found the bodies of 87 men who had taken shelter when they had nowhere else to go. 

[Another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzJPGj3D1O8&feature=related) from the BBC 24hrs after

Deepwater was a more serious ecological disaster, but one cannot discount the impact of knowing that this rig burned so hot that steel supports melted, with workers still trapped on board or jumping 20 stories to the water below. 
This isn't real. This can't be real. Is this real?This must be fake because according to all the conspiracy theorist, the flame from fire from burning gas and oil does not get hot enough to melt or weaken steal.

Then the spiders scurry off, and I'm left with an even more life-threatening situation.This reminds of what me and my brother used to do. We lived in a village in India and as u would expect there would be all kinds of insects and such... Especially after a heavy rain, there would be a swarm of moths crowding around the fluorescent light literally buttfuckin it. Both our cats would just sit there all night looking up at them...Feeling sorry for them, we would put them on top of a badminton racquet and lift them up towards the fluorescent lamp. The cats were nervous at first, but when they saw the moths coming closer, they just went into RAGE mode.. After a few weeks, they started sitting under the badminton racquets and meow all night to get our attention....
We were a wonderful TEAM...

So naturally I thought: ""you're going down, spider bro"". So I brushed it off my sheets towards my cat Jaffa. Who just stood there.

It ran off so I brushed it towards her again, and she just looked at it. It ran of AGAIN, so I brushed it towards her. This time she bats it very lightly with no claws, then gets bored and leaves my room. Goddammit cat.Bachelors? PLEASE.

I think the piece just went up yesterday, little more than a week after he died, which makes the piece all the more touching. I found the fact that the artist was so moved by MCA's death that he would go to such incredible efforts, undertaking a piece of such size and complexity really blew me off my feet. You've really got to stand under it with your jaw hanging open to grasp the scale of it, I recommend anyone in Brighton to check it out.Such a great tribute. RIP Adam, keep reppin the 5 boroughs in whichever afterlife has proven awesome enough to hold you[deleted]I got really excited to go see this today, then I realized I live in New England and you live in England England.  Love living in a place named after a still existing place, not at all confusing.This makes me wanna grab my Backstreet friend and get loud.I saw this on Friday afternoon, just as it was being finished I think. There were a lot of people gathered around, some quietly paying their respects, some getting to know each other and bonding over what the Beastie Boys/hip hop meant to them. It was a very nice moment. I hope it stays up for a long time.Great tribute, but no ""eat me"" on the tail?Seeing Brighton, I misread the title as YMCA.Dude left off the 3MTA3 off the tail othe plane....I saw this being done the other day on my way back from work. I fucking love this town.Fantastic. It's a shame how much people cared about Whitney Houston, but MCA just got a passing mention on the evening news. He deserves better.

RIP MCA, RIPFor the metric system users: it's about 4m by 21m.I wouldn't have thought that Minimum Crossing Altitude would incite that much passion. I know aircraft safety is important, but damn.Wow that is great. I remember having that album on tape cassette and would sneak it into school to listen too during recess.Where is this? Is it near the station? I wanna go have a look on my way home from finishing my dissertation. 

Also very happy to see Brighton on the frontpage. I saw him when he was doing this! This was 3 days ago and he had just done a dark green outline when I met him. He was collecting his spray cans from the back of his car and we had a small chat about some drunk guy that kept swearing. It's truly incredible, shame it can't be there forever.I hope that one day when I die, someone will paint a tribute like that for me.. lol who am I kiddingSeeing my hometown on the top of the front page. How about that!I just studied abroad in Brighton, just missed it!Awesome pic, but they missed the best part of this album cover.  EATMEi could generally give a shit when musicians die. whitney? meh. micheal? shrug. but mca's death really hurt. i saw them in philly several years ago and the performance was just outstanding.

 i always tell people if you have even a slight chance of seeing the beastie boys live see them. call in sick from work. pawn something for the cash. whatever you have to do but see them. cuz they are a top 50 band to see before you die.

now it looks like a tour will never happen again. truly a shame.Hrmmm.

from the looks though, some igneous pluton kept that specific bit of bedding from eroding, likely from water, as the landscape around it changed the water has a high propensity to simply follow the easiest path to cut leaving that bit exposed after it eats through most of the face around it.

With the layers face exposed, and from the looks of the talus lying around, this is some kind of sand/silt/mud alternating environment for the deposition and *as we all know* the silt and mud stones will be much more susceptible to erosion than the sandstone.

With the weakening of the structures overall integrity and possibly some residual stress from whatever compression caused the horses and more than a handful of thousands of years we're left with a cool hole.

Cool, want to teach me what happened then? 
I don't know much of the make-up of the area from just looking at the photo, wiki seems to say it's largely dominated by limestone, doesn't say much else, also found [this](http://pedagogie.ac-montpellier.fr/disciplines/svt/clape/stratigr.htm) but I can't read french and google translate isn't catching everything.  From what I can parse, It's varying layers of limestone, not sand/silt/mud stones, all of which makes sense for the area.  Letting to much of my background get to me, I live in the south west where most of our lithology, the more recent stuff anyway, is different colored sand stone.

Get together food + water for 3 days and put it in the trunk of your car.  Fill up your car's gas tank - siphon it from your lawn mower if the stations are empty.

Get insurance papers, titles, birth certificates, deeds, a water bill or two, or any other documents you will need to prove your identity and property ownership.  Wedding & family photos, computer backups should go too (now is a good time to start backing up to The Cloud).

Pack clothes for 3-4 days. Don't forget diapers for the wee ones.  Food & water for your pets, too.  Use a carrier, and if your pet is microchipped, bring along the number in case they get lost.

If you have a gun safe, hopefully you bought a quality one with adequate fire protection.  Shelters typically don't allow firearms, but if you happen to have one with you, *I know nothtink!*.  A sleeping bag per person would be good to have, as the cots are pretty uncomfortable.

Don't bring stuff like furniture.  That's why you have insurance.

In 2009 we also had devastating bushfires ([Black Saturday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires)) that claimed  173 lives- we Victorians are sadly aware of the tragic consequences of these events. 
I have read on wikipedia that no lives have been lost yet in these fires and thank goodness for that, let's hope it remains so.

From one fire-prone state to another, my thoughts are with those affected.OH GOD! What about the SGC!?Looks like [Santa](http://i.imgur.com/yxc8d.jpg).Reminds of the [fire](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1096/1127330849_14547dc5b8.jpg) the [Okanagan](http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/yearinreview2003/gfx/titlephoto08.jpg) [region](http://www.st-hubertus.bc.ca/shub/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fire-Gate-Vineyard-031.jpg) had back in [2003](http://www.sfu.ca/geog/geog351spring09/group06/Forest%20Fire/Gallery/OkanaganFire1.jpg).Up in Boulder too. It's getting scary.Yeah, It's nuts.  I'm still at the Air Force Academy and it's pretty close.  They already evacuated the base housing but there aren't fires on base yet.  The biggest thing was the smoke.  I have a bunch of pictures I took from the past few days.  If you want me to post them let me know.  Looks like a pyroclastic flow, that shit cray> ~~Looks like Armageddon.~~

**Is Armageddon.**
Firing fire fighters probably was not a great idea then. http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14303473Can someone with knowledge explain what the possible consequences of a fire like this are?  More specifically, how far can it go?  Could it get closer to Denver and into more densely populated areas?I hope you are safe.

Do you have water to drink?  Can you breathe the air?Yep, it's pretty crazy here. Kktv.com or Gazette.com to stay up to date.

Buy such tickets as investments and hold them for a few decades. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that the increase in admission prices to Disneyland has exceeded inflation.I went to Disney when I was about 9. It was September 11. I was at the Epcot Park. They evacuated everyone with explanation. They gave everyone in the park 1 free pass for 1 day. My family and I saved and used it about a year ago. They had to find the supervisor which took 20 minutes. The manager couldn't believe and after 3 phone calls they finally let us in. The manager kept the tickets.Lemme call up a buddy of mine. He's an expert on tickets your mom has. You should ask your mother for old family photos from the trip. Take some before and after shots in the same location if you can find them!I know from experience that those tickets will work. I had a pass even older than that  and used it 3 years ago.Knowing Disney it will work. Maybe not as easy as handing it to them, but they'll call a manager over and probably let you in.It will work.  The tickets they sell don't expire.

Our family went though that with my grandmother: not only did she slowly confuse us with other people, she grew extremely paranoid of people stealing her things.

At one point she looked me in the face and asked me where I was. Apparently in her confused state, she was looking for a younger version of myself. Alzheimer's is a fucked up thing.wow. just look at them. they spent 78 out of 94 years of life. losing someone you've been with for that long must feel like the end of your own life. this picture is pure beauty.This a great photo. And I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope he lived a great life. And your gramps had one helluva sense of humor I'm sure! RIP !Do you have any photos of them young and in love?

It's amazing how all of such a long life together comes to end in such a mechanical looking place like that.  There should be a special place in hospitals for those who are very very sick.  A nice big, soft, comfy bed and whatever else they want or need.  I hope she is dealing okay with this. I've known my current SO one year and couldn't imagine saying goodbye.

78 years is a long time. Lucky man, lucky woman, they must have been very happy together.  [deleted][this is the only photo I have on my computer](http://i.imgur.com/xqiVq.jpg)

My Mimi is an amazing artist and painted this; my Gramps in the late 70s.
I'll go home tomorrow and collect more photos.What a beautiful picture. My mom is a a recent widow after 40 years of being with my dad and she says she feels lost. I can't imagine what your grandma must be feeling after 78 years. May love and peace guide her and your family through this time. On a positive note, it's incredible how people have the ability to be so witty on their death bed. I loved what your grandpa said to you. Just before my dad passed, I asked if he'd forget me and his eyes opened wide and said "" nooooo! You are being awful silly thinking that "" I'm so sorry for your loss, but I'm sure you'll have many fantastic memories.
My Grandad died last month, after being ill with cancer for a while. He was 91, and my Gran is 89 - they had been married 66 years. At Grandad's funeral my Gran (wheelchair bound and frail herself) said to me ""you know, we were married 66 years... and it would have been more but he had to go to the war. I waited for him"". That totally broke me. They werre soulmates, and, like your grandparents, inspirational to the generations that follow them.  Can we have a dedicated board for this kind of stuff?I'm sorry for your loss, but I hope that you will feel some sort of closure with this.  I lost my grandfather and uncle (whom I've only seen once every 3-4 years due to living in different countries) this summer.  For my grandfather, he had been in perfectly good health and one day he suddenly had a heart attack and didn't make it through the night. I'm still trying to sort myself out.  It's too easy to get stuck into guilt traps after someone passes away (I should have called more, I should have gotten up that morning to help him walk the dog, etc).  

If you dont mind me asking, was his health deteriorating beforehand or was it relatively unexpected?I feel your pain. My 99 year old Grandfather passed away last week. He and my 94 year old Grandmother were married for 77 years. Peace to you and your family during such a difficult time. <3What a lovely, poignant photo. Seventy-eight years. Wow. I can't imagine what it must be like to be with someone for nearly eight decades and then lose them. Sincere condolences to you and yours, OP. Truly until death do us part.[deleted]I'm sorry for your loss and completely empathize.  

I'm not quite to that point but I'm getting there with my grandparents.  They recently sold her car because she shouldn't be driving anymore and they've started going through their possessions and have been giving them away to family members (I think so that they get to decide/see where they go instead of leaving them behind.)  They also have been scouting out which assisted living facility they'll be going to.  This is, I think, going to be the hardest part.  

I mean, I know they're old and he's been saying things like, ""assuming I live that long,"" for a while.  So their deaths won't really come as a surprise.  But watching them live only to die is going to be horrible.

The ONLY positive in this situation is that one of the homes they're looking at is about 2 minutes from where I live which will make bringing their only two grandsons to visit them in their remaining time much easier.  They take every opportunity they can to see them.  

**TLDR:** My grandparents are at the start of this phase of life and it sucks.Am I the only one who hates these posts? I mean no disrespect, but I cannot imagine your grandparents would like you to share this very intimate moment of theirs to millions of people - whether this is about Karma or not. Give them some privacy. It is beautiful, of course - but only if you know them. Otherwise, it is voyeuristic.You have to be kidding me with this shit.  Why the fuck is this in r/pics? Do you losers have any sense of pride or is any kind of attention worth it in your empty lives?   Do you have real friends? If they were married at 16,so do they have great grand kids ?.I love the way he's holding her hand with both of his. Sorry for your loss. First off an off tops, rest in peace to your grandfather but can we get a happier picture of the two, please?Well, he died with humour. I suppose that's something :) Sympathies mate Died with Alzheimer's, still acknowledges that you're related. I'd call that a smashing success. If I were to die with a horrible degenerative disease like that, giving one final ""fuck you"" to my mental tormentor would be a great way to go.

Whatever you believe in, your grandfather loved you and the rest of the family to the end. After your and your family's tears dry up, learn about the man. Tell good stories, happy ones. Cry more if you need to, there is nothing wrong with crying, but learn from him. Learn from your grandmother while she's still alive and able to hear and speak.

There's no wrong way to live your life, but through them and everyone around you, there are lessons to learn on how to live the happiest.

I wish your family a gentle time to recover from your loss, and to gain a stronger family bond.

Most Americans see a humble pot legalizing man and just rush for the upvote button. This is a mistake, as he is not a very good president. Humble and somewhat honest, yes, but he is not ready to negotiate with the big boys. Every time he goes to Argentina to negotiate something with Christina Kirchner Uruguayans lose something. She plays him like a fucking violin and its so sad to see.

Dont get me wrong, all the other options for president in Uruguay are still shit and fucking corrupt. But I feel they would be able to handle Christina better than Pepe. And that relationship is much more important than some corruption for Uruguayans I think. Just my 2 cents.This is a man who cannot be bought.[deleted]The little thumbnail looks like he has his dong out.His country also legalized weed and abortions. YAY!Apparently he's also somewhat of a badass:

Nobody from my family at that point has ever been to the states, knew anyone in the states, or particularly liked anything about the US (ok, maybe the movies). Moscow has a 9 hour difference with the East Coast (it was 10 hours back then, before they changed the daylight savings) so all the news reports about 9/11 started coming in in the evening, and went through the night. I was only 11, so I was in bed fairly early. My mom however stayed up all night crying in from of the TV, on the phone with her mother who was doing the same thing. 

Did that mean that that night my mom along with many others in Russia, started feeling differently towards the US? Was that horrific event capable of changing an entire nations opinion? Of course not. That had nothing to do with it. Russia has endured many terrorist act within the country. people there know what it's like, after another bomb goes off in the subway, but you still have to take the train to work. (I had to take it to school). They know what it's like when the terrorists make sure they detonate the bombs in apartment buildings at night, when everyone is in their beds asleep, but- you still have to go to sleep, so you can get up and take that train to work in the morning.

So the fact that it happened in the US, didn't matter. If the next day you were discussing politics, you'd criticize the US policies the same way you always would, and your opinion about that wouldn't change. But that night we felt for the PEOPLE. Not Americans, Canadians, Russians- just people. It didn't enter anyone's mind to care about it any less because it didn't happen in our country, it didn't matter that US was extremely unpopular in Russia/Europe. These were the same people, whether from New York, or from Moscow- they got paid, went home, hugged their kids, worried about tomorrow, complained about taxes, criticized the government. They loved and hurt just like anyone else on this planet. 

What I'm trying to say is- it doesn't matter where the monument is or who it was built by. It might look weird to some. Some might think it's not up to some sort of standard, some might say it could've been different. The truth however is that, no matter how it looks, I believe based on what I just said, that the feelings and reasons of the people who built it, are genuine and exactly the same as they would've been had it been built by people from Manhattan. As far as I'm concerned, that's the part that matters.

Tl;dr:  There's shorter posts in this thread.  

Edit: "" Or who it was built by""- Lost half a sentence along the way [deleted]I saw a giant tear drop inside of a broken tower. You fucking jackasses just watch way too much pornography. That is pretty sweet. I'm not immediately recognizing the specific symbolism. I just enjoy the juxtaposition of the jagged brick and the metallic drop.""It was initially given to the local government of Jersey City, but was rejected once city officials actually saw it.""

What a bunch of assholes.What you aren't seeing is the building sized mural featuring George W Bush and Vladimir Putin that accompanies the monument. Not kidding. Thanks, Russia.  As an American I appreciate this acknowledgement of our tragedy.That's cool, one country does something nice for another and we immediately mock it... For those of you legitimately don't know what the monument is, it's a tear drop inside one of the World Trade Center towers that is broken down the middle.Who's responsible for this... http://i.imgur.com/l0T5h.pngSup,

I'm russian and it was WOW when i saw that thread. I don't heard about that monument or heard and forgot. So, it's cool! Fuck that cold war talking we have same grief called terrorism! Peace to everybody, let's start new era.
proof that i'm russian http://i.imgur.com/uZ7et.jpg It made me really upset when I first learned about this. Because people thought it was tacky or strange, it received no attention. Where the hell are our monuments to the tragedies of other nations? Have we built anything for the tsunami victims? For the London bombings? (Hell, we took OUT the London bombing tribute from the Olympics) 

It's sad.[deleted]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Struggle_Against_World_Terrorism

It is in new jersey. I really don't like the way it looks, but I appreciate the fuck out of it. These sorts of things are way too overlooked. Our country was hurt and this represents another unaffected country reaching out to us. The gesture is just so *kind.* There isn't as much of a reason to do something like this on political grounds, this was just humans being human to each other. 

Thanks for this, Russia! This memorial has a place in my heart *because* of its origin, and I appreciate the way it looks because it has clear intentions and its the way you presented it to us. Doesn't matter what it looks like. Thanks, Russia.I wonder how many of the people here calling that a vagina have actually seen a real one.Thank you Russia, seriously this made my day.Nice of them to send something.  Whatever it is.Why is everyone making fun of it? I like it a lot :(Am I the only one who finds it kind of beautiful?It looks great. When the Vietnam veterans memorial wall was announced as the monument we were going to build there was a lot of disagreement, too. Some people thought we should build a generic monument of soldiers holding the American flag. But the memorial wall wasn't supposed to be ""Go 'Murica"" it was supposed to be a way to show respect to the dead soldiers. I think this Russian monument means a lot more than a typical statue of a proudly standing soldier. (No hate for proud soldiers, though)Damn Russia really has changed. Can we stop depicting them as the villains in movies now.
Okay, honest question here. have we (the US) every donated a monument to other countries? Because we have so many monuments that have been donated to us from other countries, but I have never heard of us sending any out.

*I guess I should point out that monuments we've made in other countries to commemorate the US don't count. Since they are still monuments about us.That's really beautiful. I'm stunned. Fucking Russians. GG

Edit (since people don't see it): It's a tower that's been cracked open, and the Russians put a teardrop in the center to signify their empathy to our crisis.Thought they were implying that we used the 9/11 attack to go after oil. Tear drop makes sense as well i guess.

It was sort of wedge-shaped and had very distinct edges. Then it hit me: it was coming from the direction of Mt Rainier. But I was on Highway 2 between Spokane and Davenport, which is something like *250 miles from the mountain*, so far that you can't see the mountain itself. 

TL;DR: Mt. Rainier might be able to cast sky shadows to almost Idaho.

On a related note, at sunset, on just the right days when it's clear, the sun sets behind Mt. Rainier, making the mountain extremely visible from as far away as Moses Lake.

I don't know what Boromir's fuss was all about.I live near Mt Rainier. We get so much cloud cover around here that ""The mountain is out"" is an actual expression. Like it's strolling down the block giving a quicky howdy-do to the neighbors.

Makes that sentence sound dirty.note to self, remember to throw that lost ring I found in the flames of mount doom.I know that this is in Washington state wholly from Red vs Blue.Very cool, but I don't think ""mindblowing"" is the correct adjective there.

Quite interesting, do you have any more information about this?[ This is the source](http://spaceghetto.st/?q=content/pics-or-it-didnt-happen-0)I love the guy on the right that seems so intrigued by all of thisIs it just me or does the guy on the top right look like he's overly interested in what he's seeing?I presume these guys were not members of the SS, but rather general enlisted men. If so, although some reports say otherwise, I'd imagine it's possible they were more or less unaware of what was going on in concentration camps. A few years back before my Opa died, I did a video interview with him asking about his past. How he grew up etc...

As a young man he was an apprentice learning how to become a painter. The master teaching him was a big Nazi fan and forced my Grandfather to attend Nazi youth meetings in the evenings, which my Opa absolutely despised going to. 

He did not like the Nazi's or what they stood for.

He was later drafted into the Wehrmacht... He goes on to tell me all of the mishaps that occurred during his basic training days. He was almost an U-Boot crew member, but screwed that up.

He failed his Panzer training as well. The only thing he was really good at was shooting. He aced marksman training all the way which landed him in a sniper training school for an additional 6 weeks.

However, after that it was many near death experiences. He spend most of his time hating his superiors, hiking through cold snow with very little to eat, dodging bombs, mortars and enemy fire along the Russian lines.

Eventually, he was captured by the Americans which he was absolutely grateful for. They treated their POW's a lot nicer than the Russians. 

So yeah, he had no choice but to join... and hated being in the war. That's all I know.

My grandmother said she had only heard rumors about what was going on with the Jews, but they had no proof. Remember, your government is telling you lies and you have nothing to compare these lies to.

As a German I hate what the Nazi's did to my country and those around them. Not only did they kill millions of Jews, but many Germans perished at the hands of the Nazi's as well. If one wasn't ""perfect"" in the eyes of the Nazi's, you had to go...










My grandfather was in the US Army, fought in the Battle of the Bulge and his entire company were forced to surrender when they were trying to take a small Belgian town near the Saar Moselle Triangle that sat at the top of a hill. His company got surrounded and cut off from the rest of the battalion on the third day of battle, and half the men in his company were dead. He said they were especially worried about being taken prisoner because the Malmedy Massacre had just occurred, and they were fighting an elite and well known division, the 11th Panzer, also known as The Ghost Divison. The 11th Panzer were one of the most battle hardened and feared of all German divisions. 

My grandfather was a POW for five months, and nearly starved to death. He said that the only reason they were starving was because the Germans were starving as well. They didn't treat most American POW's very poorly, at least not at his prison camp. He said a few of the guards were friendly and would give them cigarettes if they had any to spare. 

I think many of the Germans were oblivious to the atrocities committed by other Germans, even the soldiers. Even after the relentless anti-Jew propaganda, I can't imagine that the entire German population would approve of taking up arms to help commit genocide. Sheesh...they all had really nice hair. I feel like if the country that I was fighting a war against showed me that my country had done that, I wouldn't believe them - I'd think it was just propaganda or something, unless there was very strong evidence. Maybe the guys that don't look horrified were just thinking that; it seems like if they believed it and had been away from Nazi propaganda for long enough, they'd see how horrifying it truly is.They aren't covering their eyes in disgust, they are closest to the camera and don't want their faces shownActually... this is part of the german education. It starts in the 7th degree and doesn't stop till you graduate. History Class in Germany is 80% Nazis (especially politics and the holocaust) and 20% European History... it's boring as hell. And the cause why germans have no national identity.

Edit: You can't say ""I'm proud to be German"" without hesitation and the feelings of guilt.[deleted]Wow.....I wonder how they felt after that.""Ah shit we were the bad guys!""[deleted]This concentration camp stuff is going on in N. Korea TODAY.  Apparently the world doesn't care now either.Hitler at 11 a clockIt's also possible that these soldiers were realizing, along with the sheer horror of what was going on, that it's very likely they personally knew someone who had been sent to the camps.  All those people who just disappeared...well, now they know where they might have gone and what they might have gone through.Looks like most of them are medics. Would be surprised if you could shock them , given they likely saw some pretty messed up things first hand. It would be really fucking hard to go through life knowing exactly what you fought for.[Heinz saw much better movies back in Germany](http://i.imgur.com/HUjSb.jpg)Imagine being drafted, forced to do terrible things by means of immediate death, seeing your country destroyed, being captured and then forced to look at pictures and watch videos of horrible things you and other people were forced to do (Of course many did it freely as well, maybe even you), then spend the rest of your life in a prison wondering what could have been.

I'm sure this was the life for many many German soldiers during WWII and I'm sure there are a few in that picture.Has no-one studied the Nazi period in history?! Conscription was enforced in Nazi Germany, meaning that those who were fighting for Germany, generally didn't have a choice. 
I'd really advise people to read more about Hitler's rise to power etc, not only because it's interesting but because it's necessary to understand how he came to power. You cannot simply state that the people of Germany should have rose up against him, it's not as simple as that. 
It's also important to understand that Britain, France, America and other  countries in the League of Nations (I know that the USA was not a member) can be considered part of the blame for Hitler coming to power.","{'Openness': 0.291, 'Analytical': 0.295, 'Sadness': 0.05904, 'Anger': 1.0, 'Extraversion': 0.747, 'Joy': 0.041292, 'Agreeableness': 0.524, 'Emotional_Range': 0.841, 'Tentative': 0.476, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.528324, 'Fear': 0.780574, 'Conscientiousness': 0.056}","{'large': 0.401312, 'family': 0.28905, 'crowd': 0.549834}"

When they build a subdivision they scrape away a lot of dirt and redistribute it.  In a lot of places what you have left is hard packed clay or something and then they recover it with a few inches of soil.  The tree roots go down to the hard stuff and then spread out instead of going way down and spreading out.This is a really cool example of how current construction practices drastically alter the hydrologic function of the landscape, while keeping the form relatively intact. Looking at the yard before the storm, you would have assumed from the green grass and healthy tree that there was healthy soil that can infiltrate rainwater and retain moisture and nutrients.  However, when we build houses, we scrape off the topsoil, heavily compact the clay sub base underneath, then roll out some turf from the sod farm and act like everything is cool.  Grass and tree roots cannot penetrate this compacted sub layer, and things like this happen!  I'm especially intrigued by this picture because we're currently researching soil mitigation practices to reverse this kind of damage on residential lawns through practices like spading and sub-soiling, which involve using large blades to rip through compacted soils and incorporating compost.  If anyone in the Baltimore area wants to learn more or participate in this important research (by letting me sample your yard), drop us a line at http://umbc.edu/UrbanSoilsThis is getting buried, but we have the same friend.

Edit: This is in Margate, NJ. This is on Baycrest Drive.That is the problem with shallow - rooted trees next to your house. They also destroy the street many times.

Edit: I want to add that deep rooted trees can grow into the water pipes. Everything has a pro and con.It looks like they just dumped 3 inches of top soil and then sod on to a hard clay lawn and expected nature to do the rest.

It will iron out.It's like the model from Beetlejuice. Dinkleburg.....I wonder how much change they found under there.With roots that shallow and short I'm surprised it stayed up long enough to grow that large...

The photo dates back to the 1930's when they were wed. The location of where they were wed was Japan but I am unsure of which city/area. Most likely Fukushima Province which is where they were from. 

They were from the Tokugawa clan.

Many believe I carry the Shishido name which isn't the case since my grandmother was the Shishido not my grandfather.

Sorry to make it seem older than it appears but it was a guess and wanted to share what I thought would be interesting to reddit.

So hopefully I can deliver on that.I've stolen this and intend to use it as source material for drawing.

It would be the healthiest way for him to channel his...needs.[Prepare](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ribwp/)[deleted]Last year I went to value village and bought somewhere between 15-20 porcelain dolls. One of my roommates was very easily frightened so about once or twice I week I would hide one in his room or somewhere he would find it. He asked me about them plenty of times and even suspected it was me but I was able to convince him that I wasn't the one doing it and I didn't have spare money to spend on creepy porcelain dolls.

I decided I'd make the last 3 really good, so I waited about 2 months before I used them so he would think whoever was doing it ran out of dolls. 2 months later I left one outside his door early in the morning because I knew he had an exam to get to that morning. Scared the shit out of him. While he was out doing his exam I left one in his room behind the open door so he'd walk in, close the door and then see the doll staring at him. That one worked too. He was also doing laundry the day before, so I left the last doll in the middle of his dried clothes in the dryer. I've never heard a louder or higher pitched scream than the scream I heard when he was getting his laundry. 

I'm debating on getting one of his roommates to do it again this year, but I don't really know any of them well enough to trust them to pull this off properly.

I wish I bought 15-20 of these clowns instead of dolls though. That definitely would have been a lot better.I'm not really afraid of clowns, but that would scare me shitless if I woke up next to that.I just choked on the food I was eating when I hit this link. That shit is hilarious.

FTFYHi Georgie. Don't you want a balloon?ka ka ka yeaya baby! (i do cocaine)Looks like you might have a valid point there.You were right to put that in his bed, then.  My girlfriend is a clown so I wake up to this every morning.

edit: here have a pic: http://i.imgur.com/UK8vK.jpgAs someone with legitimate coulrophobia, if my roommate ever did this, I would  ~~end up going ape shit on him~~ get away with justifiable homicide.  I'm not even joking.  I'm actually kind of mad at myself for not checking the comments first, and now the small picture is still freaking me the fuck out.

I think I've had enough internet for the day.

EDIT: [TIL the different conditions for justifiable homicide.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justifiable_homicide)

""The ""heat of the moment"" defense, in which death results from a situation where the defendant is deemed to have reasonably lost control, is often considered a part of the defense of provocation against a charge of murder. This is based on the idea that all individuals may suddenly and unexpectedly lose control when words are spoken or events occur but, again, jurisdictions differ on the extent to which this should be allowed to excuse liability or merely mitigate to a lesser offense such as manslaughter, and under which circumstances this defense can be used.""I put [this](http://i.imgur.com/nFCHG.jpg) in my roommate's pillow.

Iran so far awaaaaay.Who ever built and designed this smoked dmt..... Oh my god this is beautiful. Such an interesting comparison between the non-representational beauty of Islamic religious sites, and the very representational nature of Christian religious sites.I went to the Imam Reza shrine is Mashhad. On the men's side, it's nice and calm. On the women's side (I didn't go there, but my sister and cousins did), all the women are pushing and shoving you aside.

The redeyes show that the photographer tried to use flash to take this picture, but as you can see, it wasn't enough to properly expose the scene. It's a long-ish tele shot at ~~4/3 aspect ratio, so it's probably taken with one of these ~20x zoom ""bridge cameras"" and its on-board flash just didn't have enough gusto. The lack of noise indicates that ISO was low, which is a little surprising, since many of these cameras like to bump the ISO value up even with flash, when they feel the flash power is inadequate.  This could therefore also have been a (micro)4/3 SLR.~~

EDIT: ... turns out I'm bad at division in my head, and the aspect is 3:2. Thanks Summon_Jet_Truck for pointing that out. So low noise isn't surprising at all, since the 3:2 aspect ratio means it was most likely a DSLR that took the picture. (edit end)

It was probably a very dark room, but I see no ghosting at all, so I'd guess that slow sync wasn't used. This means the shutter speed was around 1/100 of a second, which is common flash sync speed. Slow sync would mean longer exposure time, increasing the probability of a shot like this.

The girl is lit so broadly, that it cannot be the AF assist light. Those are practically always very focused and narrow-angle. The girl must be lit by the flash of her camera. What this means is that she happened to take her photo in that approximately 1/100 second window.

Considering how nobody else is paying any attention to the girl or the direction of the photographer, I'd guess neither was taking multiple photos here. From that I'd conclude there was no planning or co-operation between the subject and the photographer and that this is a pretty damn lucky shot! 

EDIT: Changed some wording to be clearer.That... Does not look like a fun concert.what concert was it?This guy: http://i.imgur.com/V3fVK.png

Every once in a while, they got up and started dancing in front of the stage. Which in itself is awesome, it makes the musicians feel good when people are having fun! BUT, all the time they were dancing they were taking pictures of themselves and their friends. After a while of dancing, posing to the camera and ""WOOOOO""ing they went back to their seats to look at the photos.

Now there are already 337 comments so no one will see this apparently original pun. Well dicks.This is ""the butterfly chair"" by Frank Lloyd Wright. Found in his Samara House in W. Lafayette, INThere are a couple of these at Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona. Nice! As an accomplished woodworker, I do have a few critiques:
The copper could be a lot cleaner. It's perfectly fine as is, I just love super crisp lines. I would have inalyed it so there is no gap with the substrate, as was done in the original FLW piece. This appears to be plywood (or some portions do at least), a good choice for dimensional stability. I would have veneered the edges on the bottom legs and the stretcher. The veneer (or solid wood, if constructed of solid wood) appears to me to be maple. The stain/finish is a tad blotchy. To avoid this, you can use a 1lb cut of dewaxed shellac as a washcoat before staining/finishing. There are commercial blotch controllers available as well (The stuff Charles Neil has is outstanding). In addition the endgrain portions took on more color than the rest. Maybe that was intentional, but I avoid that at all costs in my work. Sanding end grain down much more than the rest of the piece works well at obtaining even color (final sanding on flat/quatersawn grain should be 180 or 220, end grain I go to 800)
Good joinery though and a great piece. That's a sweet ass chair. Well done sirThat chair is awesome.That is a classy looking chair, very retro. The chair emanates aggressiveness.This chair, I like it.

edit:grammar LOL I have signed all cards for all important family occasions since marrying my husband. Also, have chosen and sent appropriate gifts for same occasions. Have done this for nigh on 45 years. When I send gifts I inform him. I have at times overlooked this step. He then will get a call and have to navigate an awkward minute or two as he tries to discern what they are talking about lolSeriously just gave this card http://www.baldguygreetings.com/servlet/Detail?no=3 to my godson for his first birthday party, five hours ago. Funny thing is, I bought that card about three years ago with the knowledge that someday there would exist a child worthy enough to receive it.

I have no girlfriend....that's a *really* good idea for a card...I love those cards.She's a keeper.  You betchaKarl? Is that you?She's a keeper.So, your ""girlfriend"" is already working your mom by showing her how big of a shitty son you are??

I recognize a future wife when I see one...Using my expert detective skills I can tell you exactly who signed it. Nobody.It's strange that the card essentially points out the meaninglessness of buying a card. It refers to a common understanding that cards are pointless, yet we continue to buy them.

What theAside from the obvious, it bothers me greatly that ""No"" is above ""Yes"". Everything about this is wrong.Head of marketing for world's largest gas pump mfgr here...  using a throwaway account :)  not sure which model this is, but requirements for pin pads are driven by PCI   https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/  industry tends to be very conservative about how to implement secure pin pad entry devices given all the security risk, and design requirements are constantly evolving

Also, notice the ALPHA?  A lot of fleet trucking companies using alpha-numeric entry for driver/vehicle ID and those alpha keys are necessary for fleet drivers to get fuel.  They pick the alpha like a cell phone, toggling through the letters.

Increasingly companies like VeriFone are doing retrofits of payment components into older pumps and you will see this kind of thing when stations want to comply with current PCI standards but don't want to buy a whole new pump.  There is going to be a lot of upgrade activity over the next 5 years as ""EMV"" type credit cards are brought into the U.S.

Hey, I would LOVE to get people's input into what they do and don't like about gas pumps!  PLEASE :)  We're working on lots of cool things at my company and would be good to get some validation of what you guys want.  Touchscreens?  Connected mobile applications?  Faster pumps with quick start and finish user interface.  User experience customized to your loyalty profile (assuming you sign up for a retailers loyalty program).  Made to order food purchased from screen at pump etc.  Let me know what you think about all these and any other ideas you have and I promise we'll do some / you'll see some of them in the not too distant future :)

How many people just mentally put in their pin number?This is weird. If you put the standard 1-9 pad as a matrix and transpose it you get this. Interesting. 

Source, my ti-83That's terrible, how is a blind person supposed to fill their car?because fuck you, that's whyProbably from China. When written vertically, stuff is read from right to left, top to bottom. [r/FirstWorldAnarchists/](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/)to avoid an apple lawsuitChinese and Japanese can be written right to left (also written from top to bottom, vertically). May explain the designer's ethnicity./r/firstworldanarchistsIs that a touchscreen? I'm not positive but it might be that they do this so people can't steal your PIN so easily. The software might have several different key layouts and switch between them - that way someone won't be able to figure out your PIN just by watching where you touch the screen.

Some banks do that on their websites. Their site will show a keypad for you to click on to enter your code, and their server verifies that the buttons you touched correspond to the random key layout it generated for you. (Which of course matches the one on screen - but this prevents someone from being able to get into your account with a simple keylogger or by monitoring mouse movements.)

It's their own version of Google Authenticator, except instead of a changing 6-digit code you have a code that stays the same, but the position of the buttons is changing. You know the numerical code, so you're good to go - others only see where you touch on the keypad, so they're out of luck unless they were able to see the digits clearly.This made me forget where the 'Q' goes in the alphabet.It's the new, Windows 8 number pad!For a lot of industrial products, human machine interface is an afterthought at best.

One can see Kaiserstuhl, a wine growing region, in the background and perhaps make out a hint of the Vosges mountain range in the background, in France. The clouds in the far back right are sitting like that because they are above the Vosges, where the raise in altitude makes the clouds form. 
I am a lurker hence the first post. 
Addition:
Germs also have to farm the Schwarzwald (black forest) in this manner because of requirements regarding the amount of forest that needs to be standing. They only clear some portions of the black forest as shown in this picture, exactly the same, throughout the entire area.

I have a set of malachite cufflinks (with mother of pearl and onyx) that I wear to every geologist junction that I go to. 


I also used to have nice malachite box (4 of them actually) that I gave to my roommate in college so that he can hold his weed in it. 


[Malachite with azurite is the best.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Azurite-Malachite-59275.jpg) My brother once gave me some Malachite to carry in my pocket.

Then I got my first ""real"" job that month out of the blue, which tripled my salary, and enabled us to escape my Mother-in-Law's apartment and my crushingly depressing occupation, as well as actually pay my bills. Things only got better after that. I don't actually believe it had any type of special powers, but I have carried it around for luck ever since.

He took itTIL Grindelwald is not just a made up name for an evil wizard in Harry Potter.OP (or any other redditor with this knowledge), maybe you can help me with a question I have:

When I was younger (maybe 13 or so) I traveled to Grindelwald with my dad. We went on a hiking excursion where we took a gondola up a mountain, then hiked a couple of hours even higher. We ended up at an ""inn""of sorts high upon the mountain where we sat down in a small common room and ate stew with crusty bread. We did not know that the trail ended up at this inn, we just found ourselves there. Because of the beauty the hike and the fact that we were cold and tired (we were just day-hikers with no experience, just out looking for an adventure) we both agree it was one of the most memorable and satisfying food experiences we've ever had.

What was the name of that place? Is it still around? The only other thing I can remember about it was someone saying all the supplies had to be helicoptered up there due to no roads.

EDIT: it was most definitely the Faulhorn. You guys are awesome, thanks for showing me that. I'll never forget that experience with my Dad.

And I forgot to mention: OP's pic is awesome.Someone just got separated from her daemon.The Chosen One AND Grindelwald?? You should consider taking your talents to r/harrypotter Make sure you marry this girl. It's obvious the sun god has chosen her for you.She is the One.How's the skiing there?

i'd totally watch ""painting with bob ross in mr rogers neighborhood""Mr. Rogers was an amazing, amazing man.

The greatest thing about him, though, was that he had no filters or masks.  He *was* the man you saw on Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.  [That's who he was.  All the time.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vV_we0kSls)Mr. Rogers accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Emmys. 

Pure magic. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEqz7yzbqBwSomething we shouldn't lose in our appreciation of that quote is that he said it was something *his mother* would tell him. 

Just goes to show how much of a wonderful impact a good parent can make. And how bad an impact a lousy parent can make. [deleted]http://i.imgur.com/ZLAmN.jpg

Slightly better version of OP's picture.There's a little display in the Pittsburgh airport dedicated to Mr. Rogers (he was from Pittsburgh), and it has a pair of his sneakers, sweater, and some other items. Every time I'm at that airport, I stop by and get some inspiration. 

Such a great guy. Fred Rogers was a real first class gentleman. I SINCERELY miss seeing him on tv. It always made my day better watching him. thank you SO SO SO much for posting this. exactly what i needed to read today. This man is as close to an actual saint as any of us will probably ever experience. He had the simplest ways of saying the most brilliant things. Mr. Rogers inducted into the TV Hall of Fame.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI_9GegVoYkToday was a day when we could have really used him.  Because today was not a beautiful day in one neighborhood.  But maybe if we learn from him, treat everyone like they are our neighbors, share, realize it's okay to be mad and sad, and try to be respectful, then maybe it won't be quite so bad.If you ever want to find the worst person in your postal code...look for the person who has ANYTHING bad to say about Mr. Rogers.This seriously brought me to tears... Seriously, the world needs another Mr. Rogers more than anything.Amazing quote from an amazing human being. I was already especially sensitive about what happened earlier today as a father of a boy in third grade and one who will be in preschool in a year or so, but then I realized that the child in this photo is roughly the same age as the children who were gunned down today. I lost it. Just imagine a world where children are greeted and loved by the likes of someone like Mr. Rogers. I'm an athiest but I'm fine with the idea of those 20 kids hanging out and being loved by Mr. Rogers. I miss him. What am suppose to do with these feelings?I can and can't believe that there are people bickering in a thread inspired by Mister Rogers. You all have potential, can you say ""potential""? Good! I knew you could. Now quit wasting it arguing on the internet. 

/soapbox offIt warms my heart to think of the things he would say today.  He had such a great and simple way of putting things to make everything not seem so overwhelming.

A light year is approximately 5,869,713,600,000 miles in length.  It would take a human transporting vehicle about 26,800 years to complete a single light year @ 25,000 miles per hour (fastest human travel recorded). It would take a human about 63,200,000,000 years to get to Andromeda *right now if it stood still* at peak efficiency...or about 45 times the age of the universe from the Big Bang.  Keep dreaming.  Even Warp drives (from Star Trek that are thought to be physically impossible) couldn't do you much good as it would take centuries to travel from one side of the Milkey Way to the other.

I traveled on a few lines already...quick, efficient and much better than flying.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_China)California is hard for Vegas.Ok people...here's the deal with high speed trains.  They're not meant to compete with airplanes in cross country travel.  Which is why you plains states see no high speed rail coming through. It's main benefit is trips of around 500 miles or so. It's at that distance and shorter that plane trips are highly inefficient.   
  
The goal of the proposed high speed rail segments are to give access to high population areas to replace short-trip flights. This will have multiple benefits.  If implemented, you will actually be able to get to your destination in equal or less time than a flight and at equal or less cost.  This will also free up airports to focus on longer range travel.  Less air traffic means less delays over the entire system, meaning even if you can't be bothered to use the train in lieu of the plane, you'll still see benefits. 
  
Stop complaining about cross country trips and shit it's not designed to do in the first place.   
  
There is nothing about the cost of any of these train lines that isn't comparable to a dozen other country-wide undertakings this country has taken on over its lifetime.  We seem to have an America full of small thinking Debbie Downers who have absolutely no vision and ability to think big.  Quite the opposite of what made this country great in the first place. Wait. What?

The [Gateway Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Project) is currently being engineered at a cost of $50 million from Amtrak.

Illinois is [getting high speed rail service. Construction started in 2010, and continues now](http://www.idothsr.org/).

Incremental construction is [happening in the Southeast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_High_Speed_Rail_Corridor), and an environmental impact study is being done right now.

And Washington State [secured $590 million in funding for high-speed rail last year](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010910788_highspeedrail28m.html).

We won't see it tomorrow, but in the next 20 years high-speed rail will happen; the United States is a *really* big place, and these things take time. Write your congresspeople so we can be sure funding continues to be funneled to these much-needed projects.Well, we certainly won't see the Florida extension anytime soon.

EDIT: Hey, I love the enthusiastic comments and insight, but just to clarify, I actually don't live in Florida. I hope no one is upset that I gave the wrong impression.Again, Phoenix doesn't even rate a pick-up. Good thing I live in San Diego! :)does this remind anyone of the board game ticket to ride?Relevant: http://i.imgur.com/1jk1d.jpgIt would be nice if it could happen, but there are probably too many interest groups that would step in to prevent it.

Example from 1991 in Texas:
> In 1991 the Texas High Speed Rail Authority awarded a 50-year high speed rail franchise to the Texas TGV Corporation
.
.
.
The plan was to connect the ""Texas Triangle"" (Houston - Dallas/Fort Worth - San Antonio) with a privately financed high speed train system which would quickly take passengers from one city to the next at prices designed to compete with or beat other transport options. This was the same model Southwest Airlines used 20 years earlier to break in to the Texas market where it served the same three cities.
.
.
.
Southwest Airlines, with the help of lobbyists, created legal barriers to prohibit the consortium from moving forward and the entire project was eventually scuttled in 1994, when the State of Texas withdrew the franchise.[60]""

I was able to live there for three months without a car, and had no issues getting anywhere I wanted to go, and that was while earning just about minimum wage.

Maybe if we had something like this here, Americans wouldn't get complacent about living in the same city for decades on end and consider a trip to a neighboring state ""a vacation"". Then again, we'd get hours of our lives back previously spent in traffic, which would be a tragedy for morning DJs everywhere.We won't while it costs a much to ride the train as it does to fly.Can you imagine how much fun bachelor parties could become? Start off in NY, train it out to Cleveland. Spend a night there. Next stop Chicago, another night there. Then St. Louis, Kansas City, etc. eventually ending up in Las Vegas. Then die. 1) High Speed Rail often turns a profit. The Shinkansen does in Japan, the TGV does in France, Hell even the Accela  does in the U.S.

2) Nobody is talking about building transcontinental high speed rail roads. Of course it's better to take a plane from LA to new York than train.

3) America is much bigger than other high speed rail countries, but we have specific regions that have the population density to justify it.
http://www.america2050.org/images/2050_Map_Megaregions2008_150.png
For example the Texas triangle has the same population density of France

4) Yes it will be expensive and yes we do already have airports and roads, but guess what? The U.S. population is going to continue to grow for generations, and huge amounts of money are going to be spent expanding infrastructure to accompany this growth, might as well be high speed rail.California Will. HELL YA

edit: Hella YaIs there a reason that the Southeast Hub only sticks to the coastline and pretty much completely avoids Tennessee? I'll just leave this [here](/r/mapporn).I would love, and I do mean love as I absolutely loathe driving in any capacity, the addition of a fleshed out HSR network in the USA.  I'd be right behind it 100%.  However, this current proposed HSR doesn't address the fundamental infrastructure problems virtually every city in the US has:  Public transportation.

Look at the stops and ask yourself how many of those cities make it easy for a *tourist* to get by without a car?  I live in Pittsburgh, personally, and I can say we absolutely lack that capacity.  Sure we have bus networks - I'd be surprised if a city existed that didn't have a bus network, but the routes changes fuck-all everyday and they're by no means an easy thing for a weekend tourist to learn.  Barring that, there are a couple other public networks that are horrendously limited. 

And I know my city is far from the only one.  A HSR system should be the icing on an already delicious public transportation cake, not the cake itself.  It's all well and good to have a dream of networking cities together, but that does us precisely zero good if we can't even build a damn network within our cities more effective than the Cincinnati Subway.

My father just retired from the County's Water Management Services and I may be able to track down something.When I looked at the thumbnail I thought the large puddle was actually the back end of a shiny black car. I then proceeded to click onto the link to find the puddle and completely ignored the bottom right area of the pic because in my mind it was already a car. I then zeroed in on the small puddle behind your grandmother thinking that was the drainage problem. My next thought was...""that's not a very large puddle, I wonder why its such a problem"". I then rationalized this by thinking there could be much greater subterranean damage and a massive sinkhole slowly forming underneath your grandmother. It was at this time I closed the open pic to read some comments. A few minutes later I reopened the picture and face palmed.A city employee told a 90 year old citizen to put a photo on the internet if something was to be done.

I actually didn't mind at first, but then he began stealing from my roommate and I, so I called the cops.  Upon arrival, they informed me that apparently, my closet could be commandeered by him without them being able to do anything about it, and then they pulled me aside, and began investigating a far more important matter:  Noticing that my roommate was female, the same group of cops that had just told me that they were impotent against a heroin-addicted squatter began regaining their sense of machismo by asking me if I'd ever stuck it in my roommate's butt.

EDIT - [Here you go.](http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2011/07/a_miami_public_works_employee.php)My thoughts go to the migration of everything to the Internet.

Now don't get me wrong,  I loves me some Internet.  And I've recently used Google docs and a dummy account to share my parents medication lists and appointment lists with their multitude of doctors.

But I bet the city worker was telling her to fill out some form on the city's website.  Something I know my parents (early eighties) could not do.

Couple this thought with all my companies health insurance benefit data being online.  I work for a construction company with around 2K employees and a mix of field and office workers of all ages.  Probably a quarter of those do not know or want to know how to use a computer, and as such they are cut off from much of the information about their health insurance benefits.

I use that only as an example and food for thought.  Queue up the comments about first-world-problems, lucky to have health insurance, lucky to have a job, etc.Wow... My mind is blown. I don't want to come off rash or like a smart ass. I am entirely serious. SOUTH FLORIDA has a huge flooding problem. It is damn near impossible to correct without billions of dollars worth of an infrastructure improvement. It was, of course, built over wetlands. Miami is particularly bad because so much of it was built so long ago, before more stringent code laws for runoff were in place. 

This picture does not do your grandmother's situation justice (At least in my eyes). It is a small puddle and it has been raining around here damn near every day. No surprise there. 

The reason they said to put it up on the internet was so that it would get a compassionate viewing just like this and hopefully action would start for your grandmother. There is such a huge problem with flooding  in south Florida there is no way they would normally allocate time and money to your grandmother's problem without this support from outside sympathetic interests. The city will be forced to work on it to save face. 


The real problem should be solved for all of the neighborhoods in dire straights when it floods. If you want to advocate for flood protection and better runoff, please do! However for more than just your grandmother. 

Cities and municipalities are constantly working on things like this all round the county and city. Right now, there is a street ripped up and the city is installing new sewers and gullys and other ways to control runoff. Unfortunitly it wasn't your grandmother's day. BUT it was someone else's grandmother's day today. Inciting this sympathetic uprising for your grandmother could get it fixed for her soon, it is taking it away from someone else. 


I am not saying that the city is by any means in the right. The best way they could help your grandmother's situation was telling her exactly what they did. Funds are tight. Perhaps you should also target city mayors, legislators, council members, and representatives that are elected in by her and her neighbors. Are they no longer looking out for the city's best interests?

I don't think it would take much more than convincing the students that the police aren't the enemies and that they can continue protesting as long as they move and make some kind of compromise. 

Although the pepper spray is said to be excruciatingly painful, I agree it's not the end of the world. However it's not the act but the principle. The way the police sprayed the protesters who were sitting down really displayed a 'fuck your rights' attitude. If he thought that would make them move, he would be stupid. Only a few of the protesters got up and fled. The rest remained seated, making the act nothing more than pointless pain-inflicting power abuse. 

This incidents relates most to a mom slapping her child in the face for misbehaving. Total disrespect, and entirely unnecessary. Even if they were breaking the law. 

Following the pepper spraying, arrests were made. The brutality escalated, according to an assistant professor at the university, Nathan Brown:

Police used batons to try to push the students apart. Those they could separate, they arrested, kneeling on their bodies and pushing their heads into the ground. Those they could not separate, they pepper-sprayed directly in the face, holding these students as they did so. When students covered their eyes with their clothing, police forced open their mouths and pepper-sprayed down their throats. Several of these students were hospitalized. Others are seriously injured. One of them, forty-five minutes after being pepper-sprayed down his throat, was still coughing up blood. Source for this paragraph: http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/

        UC Davis Community

Dear Member of the UC Davis Community,

Yesterday was not a day that would make anyone on our campus proud; indeed the events of the day need to guide us forward as we try to make our campus a better place of inquiry, debate, and even dissent. As I described in my previous letter to the community, this past week our campus was a site of week-long peaceful demonstrations during which students were able to express their concerns about many issues facing higher education, the University of California, our campus, our nation, and the world as a whole. Those events involved multiple rallies in the Quad and an occupation of Mrak Hall which ended peacefully a day later.

However, the events on Friday were a major deviation from that trend.  In the aftermath of the troubling events we experienced, I will attempt to provide a summary of the incident with the information now available to me.

After a week of peaceful exchange and debate, on Thursday a group of protestors including UC Davis students and other non-UC Davis affiliated individuals established an encampment of about 25 tents on the Quad. The group was reminded that while the university provides an environment for students to participate in rallies and express their concerns and frustrations through different forums, university policy does not allow such encampments on university grounds.

On Thursday, the group stayed overnight despite repeated reminders by university staff that their encampment violated university policies and they were requested to disperse. On Friday morning, the protestors were provided with a letter explaining university policies and reminding them of the opportunities the university provides for expression.  Driven by our concern for the safety and health of the students involved in the protest, as well as other students on our campus, I made the decision not to allow encampments on the Quad during the weekend, when the general campus facilities are locked and the university staff is not widely available to provide support.

During the early afternoon hours and because of the request to take down the tents, many students decided to dismantle their tents, a decision for which we are very thankful. However, a group of students and non-campus affiliates decided to stay.  The university police then came to dismantle the encampment.  The events of this intervention have been videotaped and widely distributed.  As indicated in various videos, the police used pepper spray against the students who were blocking the way. The use of pepper spray as shown on the video is chilling to us all and raises many questions about how best to handle situations like this.

To this effect, I am forming a task force made of faculty, students and staff to review the events and provide to me a thorough report within 90 days.  As part of this, a process will be designed that allows members of the community to express their views on this matter.  This report will help inform our policies and processes within the university administration and the Police Department to help us avoid similar outcomes in the future. While the university is trying to ensure the safety and health of all members of our community, we must ensure our strategies to gain compliance are fair and reasonable and do not lead to mistreatment.

Furthermore, I am asking the office of Administrative and Resource Management and the office of Student Affairs to review our policies in relation to encampments of this nature and consider whether our existing policies reflect the needs of the students at this point in time.  If our policies do not allow our students enough flexibility to express themselves, then we need to find a way to improve these policies and make them more effective and appropriate.

Our campus is committed to providing a safe environment for all to learn freely and practice their civil rights of freedom of speech and expression.  At the same time, our campus has the responsibility to ensure the safety of all others who use the same spaces and rely on the same facilities, tools, environments and processes to practice their freedoms to work and study. While the university has the responsibility to develop the appropriate environments that ensure the practice of these freedoms, by no means should we allow a repeated violation of these rules as an expression of personal freedom.

Through this letter, I express my sadness for the events of past Friday and my commitment to redouble our efforts to improve our campus and the environment for our students.

Sincerely,

Linda P.B. Katehi
ChancellorAre you guys still ""the land of the free""?

Because sitting with a couple of friends on the ground and getting pepper sprayed while people are watching and doing nothing seems not very democratical.I have read many many posts trying to justify police's recent actions. 

Right now, tell me, for Love of God, if this is not police brutality, then what constitutes as police brutality? Do they have to rape people anally? Do they have to put bullets in our heads? 

Just think for a second. A group of students sitting. Doing nothing. And you pepper-spray them. This is the situation here. Nothing more. 
so umm, why dont these protestors get some damn goggles and shit to cover their nose and mouth ?America, why do you have 'campus' Police? And why the fuck are they given fucking riot gears?

The looks on Hillary's and Obama's faces speak volumes. The gravity of Obama's expression is almost frightening. Keep in mind this operation involved sending less than 30 men hundreds of miles into an unsupportive territory. Landing in the middle of a city. Assaulting a compound. Killing an entire group of people. Losing a helicopter. Recovering the body of Bin Laden. Safely evacuating all personnel including the crew of the lost helicopter. Then flying hundreds of miles to safety without being engaged by hostile forces.

hilary's white folder - top line ""top secret codeword noforn""The best photo of a US President I think I've ever seen. What must be going through that man's head at that moment.I can't stop looking at Hilary.  She always seems so phony in public appearances, but this shows real emotion.What I love most about that photo, is that if one saw it 20 years ago, and were asked ""which person is the president,"" one might be hard pressed to answer correctly.Caption from the official photo by Pete Souza: ""President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House, May 1, 2011. Please note: a classified document seen in this photograph has been obscured.""

EDIT to point out interesting detail: the man sitting center-stage in this photo is [Brigadier General Marshall B. ""Brad"" Webb](http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=12900)That's a powerful photo. Nice to see something about these events in this subreddit that's not a meme. [deleted]I would like to know what that blurred out photo on Hilary's laptop is of. The SEAL team seems a bit redundant, given that Obama's stare alone probably could have killed Bin Laden. I would love to be a fly on that wall. This really is an incredible photo. Obama's ""this is as serious as anything can ever get"" stare says it all. Hilliary's reaction is so genuine. The mass celebrations didn't do much for me, but this one image makes me a bit more proud of my nation -- at least the top-end people know this isn't a football game. That matters greatly to me.That Air Force Brigadier General was Colonel Webb and my base commander at Hurlburt Field for a few years. Pretty awesome to see him there and have talked with him before!!!! [deleted]Biden looks confused and slightly drunk.  You can't spring this kind of shit on him after happy-hour.Look at Obama when he ran for office; look at the picture of him linked here.


He sits in these meetings all day, and can't talk about them - and instead has to spend his public time releasing birth certificates to satisfy reality tv show hacks.    This is why his hair is now gray, he knows what you don't.


Agree with him or not, you gotta respect the presidency.I would guess that the blurred image in front of Hilary is a print-out of a satellite image of the compound where they found and killed Bin Laden. I saw a graphic of it (on Reddit) today and it's triangular in shape, just like the image in front of her. Also, the pic is grey and sandy, as I imagine an image of the compound would be. 

I just want to marvel for a second of how amazing our technology is that I am in Chicago, IL and before yesterday, I didn't know that place even existed. Less than 24 hours ago, Navy Seals entered that joint, shot the world's most wanted man and I saw a map of the compound today, and a blurred aerial image of my president, a few feet away from that same image, from less than 24 hours ago. That's pretty incredible. My grandfather and my father had access to nothing like that. 

Crazy.It's interesting to see where people are sitting.  The Gen Webb at the head of the table?  While he's part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  His boss (Boss's boss's boss more likely) Secretary Gates is sitting at the side of the table next to Secretary Clinton.  President Obama is sitting on Gen Webb's right in a very back seat position in a much smaller chair.   (no disrespect to the president, it's just an interesting dynamic.  It potentially shows a humbled role that he's taking in the events) And VP Biden is sitting across from the two secretaries.

Additionally, Adm Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, doesn't even have a seat at the table?

Nothing positive or negative in those observations, just interesting to see that level of our leadership at work.If you look closely on the table, you can see Obama's wallet.  It's the one that says ""Bad Motherfucker"" on it. I wonder if there were cams on the soldiers.

It came quickly in his sleep. 
My father, the bearded bad-ass, passed away after a three year battle with cancer on Saturday 4/21/2012. I am in the airport headed to the funeral now. We are grateful for the time he was with us. He would not want us to mourn him, but to celebrate our lives while we are living them.

Obit: http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/fortwayne/obituary.aspx?n=thomas-d-mclaughlin&pid=157201711&fhid=6182

Any redditors in the greater Ft. Wayne Indiana area that are interested in attending any services are more than welcome. The place will be packed, but there is always room for a few more.

You have all been so warm and giving during this trying time. A huge thank you from the entire family.

Details:
Mass of Christian Burial is noon Friday, April 27, 2012, at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, with calling one hour prior. Fr. Anthony Steinacker officiating. 
Calling is from 2 to 5 and 7 to 9 p.m. Thursday, April 26, 2012, at D.O. McComb & Sons Maplewood Park Funeral Home, 4017 Maplecrest Road, with a Vigil service at 8 p.m.

Please no  Up-Votes for this as I do not want it to appear as though I am whoring out my father's death for Karma on Reddit. I know many have followed this post since the beginning and I promised to update.

I also do not mean for this to be a huge downer for those of you who were cheering him on. He fought hard and won a few more precious months with his family and friends. We are thankful for every minute we had with him.
Thank you again.





UPDATE: 2:29PST He is out of surgery. They took the left upper lobe of his lung and a six inch tumor that had branched across to his heart. He responded well physically to having been splayed open from both sides if his body, as best as a person can I guess. He is off the by-pass machine but is now in and will continue to be in a sedated state for the next several days. You just can't keep a good man down. 
Thanks again for all the support.

UPDATE: 1/7/2012 11:43am - Well I just heard form my mother. He is well enough to have the breathing tube, ventilator and all IV's except for pain meds removed. They are calling it a miracle that he not only survived but is recovering as quickly as he is. This will be my last update for a few days. From my whole family... Thank you Redditors for your undying support. I knew I could count on your love of bad-assery and beards.

Update: 1/11/2012 9:36pm - It's been just a few days now and things seem to be going remarkably well. The doctors are a little stunned to see my dad recover so well and with such vigor. He has been flirting with the nurses and wants to go home. He is off all systems now and just wants to be at home and get his strength back.
My mom described the incision as this: It looks like someone was performing an autopsy and realized he was still alive so they sewed him back up. He has an incision that starts in the middle of his back and goes all the way around to the front of his chest and then turns up and goes to his Adam's apple.
I am hoping to get some pictures of the scars.
Thanks again for all the support.

Update 2/2/2012
Dad is recovering slowly. He is still quite heavily drugged to mask the considerable pain he would be in otherwise. They have him walking regularly and getting as much exercise as he can handle. It will be a while before he goes back in for another scan, so it is still too early to say what the long term prognosis is. I will let you know as I learn more.
Thanks for all your support.


UPDATE: 3/8/2012
I have waited to post this as I didn't want to bring anyone down who has been following along. Your words of encouragement have meant the world to me and my family. Thank you Reddit community. It's been a few months since the surgery. Dad went in for a full body scan. They found more cancer. There is no cure and no real treatment for it. It will take him and he seems resigned and calm about that fact. It's just a matter of time. I have pasted his Facebook update as of this morning below. Thanks again for all your good wishes.
----------
From the horses mouth: Yes, I do have four more sarcoma's. One on my lung and three on my Liver. There is no cure, and the treatments are worse than the cancer. I will fight for as long as I can, but when the Good Lord comes calling, I will be ready to go home. I love all of you who have followed my fight, now pleas pray for my family
Tom If that beard has anything to say about it, he's gonna pull through.Just talk to him and record everything. What I wouldn't give to have the voice mails AT&T deleted of my dad... And those were just him asking me to call him back. Would if I could, Dad. Would if I could.

Edit: I forgot to wish you all luck. You, him, and your family will be in my thoughts.YOU MUST REPORT BACK!Here's to hoping he does survive and thrive. If not, my gramps will show'em where he keeps his moonshine still up there in heaven.Tell your dad fuck cancer on our behalf. Thanks everyone. Up-votes to you all for your kind wishes.
This is his 3rd and final shot at beating cancer. He has gone through it twice in the last 2 years. The chemo and surgeries have taken their toll on his body. He refused chemo (just couldn't take it anymore) a few months ago and once you do that they won't let you go back.
He and the whole family came out to my house for a big family Christmas. It was a great time. 12 Irish Catholics crammed into a 3 bedroom house to celebrate Christmas. You can imagine. 
I bought him a seat at his first and likely last live Texas Hold'em tournament. We went together and both played. Though we didn't win a thing, just playing was checked off of his bucket list.
The doctor's basically said, this is it. If we don't operate you will die. The surgery could kill you but there is a 1 in 10 chance you'll survive another year if all goes well.
The trip over the holidays was no doubt his way of saying goodbye. He's made it clear that he is ready to go. We've had a number of talks about it all and though sad and painful, he understands that it ends at some point. At least he had a chance to say good bye to the whole family together one last time.
Live it while you can folks. Life is short.
Thanks again for all your support.
D.

UPDATE: Front page of Reddit last night. Thanks so much for all the support. I told him the whole internet was praying for him before he went to bed last night. It s 9:22am PST and he is still in surgery. I will update as soon as I know anything. Thanks again for all of the support.

Update: 2:09pm PST The operation is very long. It is open-heart By-Pass surgery to remove tumors from his heart and lungs. They took an artery form his leg and used it to send blood around his heart to the machine that will continue to circulate blood through his body after they stopped his heart. The have to stop the heart in order to operate on it, for obvious reasons. He has been on by-pass for a considerable period of time now. I have not heard from my mother and sister who are at the hospital waiting. Again... my most sincere thanks to all of you who have been following and extending your warm thoughts and prayers. I had no idea this would happen. It's been an amazing show of support for a complete stranger. Thank you from my entire family. I will update again when I hear news.[deleted]People with his kind of attitude live forever. Tell him reddit is standing with him shoulder to shoulder, and that some random dude in Ireland is wiping tears out of his eyes.Rooting for your dad. He seems like an awesome guy. [deleted]That beard says, ""I don't always have surgery but when I do, I fucking *survive*!""  
Best wishes to your dad and the rest of your family! I hope everything goes well! UPDATE: 1/7/2011 11:43am - Well I just heard form my mother. He is well enough to have the breathing tube, ventilator and all IV's except for pain meds removed. They are calling it a miracle that he not only survived but is recovering as quickly as he is.

I knew I could count on your love of bad-assery and beards.With all these posts all ready, I'm sure no one will read this. I just want to get this off my chest. I'm tearing up thinking about when I lose my dad. He has diabetes and leukemia. He isn't healthy. I don't want to lose him. 

I wish your father the best of luck. Hold up strong, OP. While the likelihood of this comment being noticed amongst the other 1100 is slim, I'd like to personally wish your father, you, and the rest of your family the best of luck.  Fuck Cancer.

M.Update: 1/6/2010 2:42pm
So appreciative of all of the continued support from all over the world. This has really been inspiring that so many people care about my bad-ass dad.
There is not a lot to report. He is heavily sedated. I do have a Youtube video which is basically audio of his surgeon talking to my mom and my younger sister detailing the procedure and the cancers that were taken from his lung and heart. Nothing too gory to hear.
It will be a few days before we know how he is healing. He is basically being kept alive by a ventilator. But he is ALIVE!
http://youtu.be/i_CDzI0k2XQGood luck to him and your family Darrin... now if you can, get off Reddit and go tell him you love him. Fuck cancerSo how's he spending what could potentially be his last day?Please please please follow up. He looks like an awesome guy.My Mom died of lung cancer about 2 summers ago.  She fought it for over 2 years, maybe 3, and looked like a skeleton by the end.

The chemo was terrible and I remember my mother saying to me, in the hospital, ""knock me out, just knock me out.""  

The drugs, the pain, it was brutal to watch.  I was like watching someone burn to death.  To be honest, it was at the point I wanted my mom to let go for the sake of ending the suffering.

It's funny.  Back in London, Ontario, the summers get bloody hot!  Humid, sticky, gross as shit.  2 weeks of this, air conditioning, recycled air, my mom in a hospital bed in her bedroom.  The family visited on the last weekend of the stupid heat wave for a visit.  My mom was to go on chemicals after that weekend and she would most likely lose her mind so... we all kind of said goodbye.

The next day, It kissed my mother good morning as my Dad opened the window.  The cool summer breeze, the day was mint!  However, I felt uneasy but went for a walk because it was a beautiful day.    I came back and went back to work.  Shortly after, I heard my father make a call that started with ""I think my wife has passed.""  I told people that I was done for the day and sure enough.

Point is, I understand your Dad's thoughts towards chemo and refusing it. Thoughts and wishes are with him.RespectThis seemed relevant, it was posted by someone called Huxtible Jones.

I don't believe in god so I wont pray for your dad, instead I want to impart something to you that might make you feel better.

Science shows us that every particle of matter from here to the end of the universe was at one time at an extreme dense and hot point that was smaller than the head of a pin. That means yourself, your father, this planet, all the stars and galaxies, everything and everyone who has ever existed was at one time the same thing.

When we die, our consciousness is ended and the energy kept in our body dissipates back into the universe, to be used again as another organism or perhaps to wait an interminable time underground. But one day, as this planet ends and if the universe does indeed go through a 'big crunch' at the end of its life, we will all be reunited again, closer to each other than we ever thought possible.

So when you look up at the night sky and see all those massive furnaces in deep spaces burning wildly, remember that you're looking at a part of you and him that you lost 14 billion years ago. Every photon of light is a part of us, we're the product of stars forging complex elements inside of their massive bodies which then had to supernova so Earth could be pelted by everything beyond hydrogen and helium.

The death of any person is a loss to us all for the very reasons I've outlined but know that one day in the future we'll take the same walk back into the stars. 

If you don't make it then Rest in Peace darrinmcl's Dad, you will be remembered.Hey, man. My dad had a surgery a year ago that was only 5% likely to survive. He was the first to get something of the kind done.

His right heart valve was pretty much shot and leaky, causing a ballooning of his artery making it likely to rupture at any moment (kinda like John Ritter). It caused his kidneys to nearly fail. The odds weren't good. Long story short, he had the procedure done and came out on top. He got a pacemaker a week later....a  month after that, they found an infection and had to operate immediately. He was as good as dead, honestly. They opened him up again, cleaned out what had to be cleaned, replaced his heart valve with a mechanical one AGAIN and wrapped his ballooned artery AGAIN. They also gave him a new pacemaker in that same procedure. He made it with even less chances.

Stay positive, man. Even if it doesn't come out alright, you know that he was an absolute boss and you were ready regardless. Stay winning and please come back with an update!!!!I wish you luck...my Dad had 4th stage renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) he had a low chance to survive if he took a new drug called Sutent. The Sutent was like a small miracle for him it shrunk the cancer enough to remove the kidney. He had one small spot on his liver they were going to remove, but the dumbass doctor took 50% instead, it never regenerated...he died 28 days later in the hospital. We said the goodbyes the weekend before surgery. 

I hope your father has his miracle...god bless you! :)","{'Openness': 0.076, 'Analytical': 0.115, 'Sadness': 0.085483, 'Anger': 0.676219, 'Extraversion': 0.91, 'Joy': 0.093374, 'Agreeableness': 0.933, 'Emotional_Range': 0.753, 'Tentative': 0.217, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.060897, 'Fear': 1.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.205}","{'highschool': 0.524979, 'tournament': 0.28905, 'baseball': 0.785835, 'sport': 0.978119, 'ballpark': 0.622459}"

Justin Bieber or Rebecca BlackLol at all the posts about how you shouldn't tip the cashier.. Tips are always split amongst everybody at a starbucks. My store barely pulls in about 80 cents an hour extra in tips, whereas bigger stores get about 6 to 8 times as much. Every little bit helps when you're making near minimum wage.

But in all seriousness, RIP. Sometimes I forget that I'm standing on the shoulders of giants whenever I do any programming.One of the most badass programmers ever(maybe ken, rms, joy...). We have shit tons of easy tools to write correct programs(gdb, valgrind, fricking OS to run shit on...). Imagine him and Ken writing the core of the whole fucking UNIX operating system on a teletype! He is one of the Original Gangsters of Computer Science. Fucking genius. The Van Gogh(probably even greater) of Computer Science.Your lack of kerning is killing me. Are his eyes pupils?

But, indeed, RIP.he had me at ""hello world"" :(I feel like his eyes are staring into my soul. Should I feel bad for saying that?Fun story about Dennis,

When I was a punk teen Frosh in HS I did a report on the history of computing and Mr. Ritchie was featured heavily in it. A few years later when I was a Jr. in HS I was in programming and tracked down Dennis to ask him some retarded question about my C homework. Never actually though he would have taken the time to answer my question but he actually sent a long thought out reply and helped me finish the assignment.

As a school bus driver, I've got to say, you must have had a seriously cool driver.  I know I try to do nice things for my kids, but someone who's stayed at that job for 12+ years and still loves the kids . . . that's awesome.[Was your busdriver named GettingTreasure and did he rip out of the bus in a rage after all his change fell out of his pocket while sitting on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hxzne/does_anybody_else_despise_how_almost_all_shorts/)That is the coolest thing ever!

Everyone in my family is fairly average height (ranging from 5'2 to 5'11). When my mother was pregnant with me, she was at a company party (my dad worked for Coca Cola at the time) and saw a little black girl dancing by herself. My mom is a sweetheart, so she went up to the little girl and started dancing with her. Lo and behold, a couple minutes into their frollicking(?) her dad came up. Her dad was... wait for it.... SHAQ. The three danced together for some time, until my mom's feet got tired.

A few weeks later, I was born. Today I am 6'2, the tallest in my family. We like to think Shaq used some crazy Shaq-magic and blessed my mother's womb while dancing.

**EDIT 3:**

Regarding some frequently asked questions:

*Medium:* I fleshed out the basic composition on a piece of paper and drew on top of that i Photoshop CS3. As far as brushes go, I mostly use the default PS brushes. If you're still learning you shouldn't worry about brushes; instead focus on learning about composition, lighting etc. Different brushes are just the icing on the cake.

*Time:* It took me about 7 hrs to complete this, of which a lot was trial end error. I didn't stress it since there wasn't a deadline.

*Crane:* I knew all along the crane is not very good. Should I have looked at what a crane actually looks like? Yes. Did I? Clearly not... It really is shit, isn't it

*Education: *I'm self-taught but I have drawn for as long as I can remember, so practicing is definitely super important. I don't really know of any good tutorials, even though I should probably check some out. But conceptart.org is a great site for anyone who needs help getting better.

*Other work:* http://cucumberboy.deviantart.com/gallery/ is where I upload some of my stuff. Not only can you see how I've learned a lot since I first started drawing with a tablet (check the upload date for each picture), but also that I am very much still learning and have a long way to go. Hopefully this'll serve as encouragement for those who are just getting started.

:)Can I say zipperhead and get away with it?NIce. A piece of friendly advice, though: Sculpy works wonders to blend edges. Latex alone isn't enough to cover the edges of the zipper, so use Sculpy clay thinned with baby oil. Stick it on with either appliance adhesive or spirit gum.  You can actually lay it over the material part of the zipper and blend it right into the skin. Powder and layer that over with latex, and then cover the final edge with creme color to blend.

Here are a couple of things I did using Sculpy to create seriously sick wounds at our State Fair a few years ago:

as kiss goodbye, whenever I had to leave him behind for school. Me and Teddy fucked  
up one day when I tried to sneak him into school. I had cleverly shoved him in my ass  
hole neighbor's backpack and told him not to tell. While on the bus he undid his zipper  
on his pack and showed the other kids. The driver saw and took Teddy. I had to come  
up with some lame excuse about ""forgetting"" to leave him at home. All little kids suck

His name was ""Monkey"" and for years I really felt this way about him. This post made me go to my old trunk and dig him out after all these years. He's now sitting on a shelf in my home office. Thanks for reuniting me with my childhood for a moment. Upvote because this made me take out my teddy bear for the first time in 25 years.Teddy Ruxpin is about to have his ass handed to him. Cool pic.There's something about seeing Pooky in battle mode that makes me tear up.  I love this picture.","{'Openness': 0.102, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Sadness': 0.045527, 'Anger': 0.950713, 'Extraversion': 0.797, 'Joy': 0.057536, 'Agreeableness': 0.855, 'Emotional_Range': 0.882, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Disgust': 0.040472, 'Fear': 0.941048, 'Conscientiousness': 0.299}","{'sketch': 0.668188, 'drawing': 0.598688}"

It seems like a lot of people want to know 1) If I'll sell them a version of the hat and 2) if I'll post instructions. Truthfully, I made the hat up as I went along and didn't expect to have to remember how I did it. Since you guys asked nicely though, I'll look at it tonight or this weekend and reverse engineer the hat into some nice instructions. If you don't know how to crochet, it might be an issue, but there are lots of great youtube channels that can teach you - I recommend [Bethintx1's channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Bethintx1).

As for selling the hat: I'm truthfully too busy to be making hats to sell online. I'd be really happy if other people used my forthcoming instructions to make the hat for themselves, but I don't think I'm up for shipping them out. If your terminally-ill grandmother's/saint bernard's/nephew's/neighbor's only wish is to own one of these hats and you've lost both your hands in a tragic fapping incident so that you can't crochet, I'll send you one for free - BUT I'LL NEED PROOF.

**EDIT** - Because people have asked: In the interest of getting the instructions out to as many people who are interested as possible, when they're written I'll post a link to them in here as well as make a new post. I'm still at work now, and I have plans this evening, but hopefully they'll be written out by tomorrow. I'll be sure to make them beginner-friendly and to include links to videos on specific techniques and so on. If you're chomping at the bit to start, I'd recommend getting a size H crochet hook and some yarn of the colors of your choice (three colors probably - for the helmet, the horns, and the beard). Make sure to hold the beard yarn up to your face to make sure it isn't too scratchy. My beard was actually an alpaca/acrylic blend (sounds fancy but it's not) for that reason.Ever heard of Thor's Hammer? You have Thor's knitting needles.I will buy one from you this very instant. Name your price, and tell me where to send the money.

I am completely serious.[deleted]My mommy knit me this and it's AWESOME!

Truly, you could (and should) sell those.   

Submit that to a Knitter's Magazine and rake in the, ""Oh my gosh!  That is so cute and clever!  You just have to meet my grand-daughter!  You would get along so well!"".Are you available?Holy Fuck! How? That would be perfect for snowboarding! I need one of those. You should put some on etsy NOW
