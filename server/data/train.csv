What do all the buttons and levers do? Couple years ago when my son was a toddler he was obsessed with garbage trucks, absolutely in love with them.  Every Friday morning we would sit on the balcony of our 3rd story apartment and watch the big ole WM truck come empty out the dumpsters and my son was just captivated, no matter how many times he had seen them before.

Now my parents lived in a little town about 35 minutes away, and we would visit them at least once a week.  My folks are oddly generous and every week when the garbage men come through their neighborhood my mom will go out there and give them all cold bottles of water, gatorade or soda.  Its just a little thing that has endeared my parents to the garbage men.  

Well just so happens that my sons 3rd bday fell on whatever day of the week was garbage day in my folks neighborhood.  While we were at their house the garbage truck comes rumbling along.  I ran out there as my mom was getting them their drinks and explained that my son just loved the shit out of garbage trucks and offered them $20 to let us have a little ride around the neighborhood.  

The driver refused the money but took us around the neighborhood anyway.  I gave the money to his partner and told him to go have a few rounds on me after work.   For the next year everytime they saw my son and I they would give us a ride, all in all we had 3 ride alongs.   

There's not really a point to this story, other than OPs pic brought back one of my favorite memories of all time.  My son was so god damn excited, but also felt pretty special, which of course made my week.I see ""JAG OFF"" stickers...Pittsburgh? Do you like your job? I've been thinking about being a garbage man. What cool stuff have you found?i'm not sure if you're aware of this...but both of my children LIVED for garbage day when they were small.  they would loose it when they heard the truck and we would run out (no matter what state we were in) to stand on the porch and watch.  we would always say hello and chat briefly with the guys.  (never a lady on my route).  so i'm not sure if you know, but you are ACTUAL heros to many kids out there.  they love you.  what's in the bag?This guy has GOT TO BE from Pittsburgh. The ""jag off"" is strong in this truck...

That and ""the shocker""...So instead of giving my trash men beer for the holidays, I should just give them cool stickers for the inside of the truck? I can do that.""Stay Drunk."" Probably not the best sticker to have in your truck. How comfortable is it sitting in there?
lots of people like to think their jobs are important but aren't.  If I didn't go to work for a week who would care?  realistically....no one.  If a garbage man didn't go to work for a week....FUCKING CHAOS.[removed]what country? i used to work as a garbagetruckman in sweden and ours were a whole lot more modern than that, also ended up making them personalized, not so much with stickers but with other things.

remember hooking up a stereo-speaker system to the rear and connecting it to the musicplayer so we didnt miss the song/the radio speaker when getting off to work.

you make surprisingly much as a garbageman in sweden too. i made roughly twice the national average a month from the garbageman job and i finished so early i could have a second part-time job after. worked between 6-10 (rouhly, we got off work when finished with our route, also sometimes had slightly earlier hours) and then had a second work starting at 1pm.

ironically you end up making almost three times swedens national average as a garbageman that way, which is fun because everyone treats you as if you're below them somehow, if only they knew.

also, note to americans, we make very little money in sweden (made up for by a lot of things being ""free"" etc) so the national average monthly salary is ""just"" 2500 a month, however this is enough to have a lower middleclass lifestyle, so it is comparable with ""a lot"" more by US standard of salary.

however, if you have a high paying job in sweden (4000 usd +) you would be better off as an american, as the swedish system is less rewarding when you succeed but gives you more room to succeed.

anyway, just my story.

tl;dr

garbagemen can make 6000+ usd monthly, where as swedens national average is 2500 usd monthly.You from Pittsburgh? We're going to the cup ya JagHaha love the Edelbrock and Summit stickers, now I'm imagining a garbage truck with a scoop and dual 4 barrel high-rise carbs tearing ass through the neighborhood scaring all the children./r/garbagetruckporn I'm surprised they let you decorate it so much like that.

I was off on my own with a straight claw hammer my dad gave to me to break apart rocks to search for fossils, I break a part a rock with noticeable separate layers and boom a full trilobite fossil about two inches long. I am super excited and ran it over to my teacher, she said ""oh  wow, I've never seen one this good outside of a museum, let me hold on to it for you so nothing happens to it"". So I go back to searching and don't find any thing else. So we get back to school and I ask for it back and she says ""no I'm keeping for the class to see, it's going on display"". I instantly start to cry and she sends me back to my desk. I get home that afternoon still upset so my dad asks me what is wrong and I go through the story, ""get in the truck now"". We drive back to school and she still refuses to give it up, we get the principal involved and he only promised to put my name on a plaque on the display.

I live about a half hour from Lake Isabella and all I've smelt is smoke for the last 2 days or so.As it stands now, 100 families are homeless. Needs more 45-minute lightsaber battles. I never would've expected to see my town on the front page.  I certainly wish it were under different circumstances.  This was basically my view coming home from work last night, although it died died down in that particular area by then.  The fire started just after 4PM yesterday and it spread across 11 miles, burning 5,000 acres in the process, over the span of just a few hours.  We've lost about 19,000 acres so far and at least 100 homes have been lost, along with many more that been damaged to some degree.  I still don't know yet if my mom and grandmother have their home; they were evacuated last night and had to come to my house in Lake Isabella, which is thankfully mostly untouched, although we are still under threat.

I was working at one of the local campgrounds (Rivernook Campground) last night and we were trying to take in as many evacuees as we could.  We're very limited on what we can do for those without tents or trailers/RVs, but at least takes some of the burden off of the elementary school and other safe zones.  I met a lot of distraught people who lost their homes yesterday.  There were planes and helicopters dropping water and retardant for hours yesterday, but this shit traveled so fast and was still under 0% containment when I went to bed around 5 AM this morning.

Some of my friends have lost their homes.  One of my son's coaches lost her ranch.  My friends' parents lost everything.  We're a humble community and many people have had to work so hard for so little and now it's all gone.  It's going to be extremely hard, if not impossible, for many of these people to recover.  The community as a whole is devastated and it's going to be a real struggle.  A large portion of the community is without power and we have been without cell phone service since yesterday evening throughout the valley.  Thankfully AT&T is installing temporary towers at this very moment so we can at least try to stay in touch with our loved ones.  I haven't heard of any deaths so far, but a lot of people have been unaccounted for because communication has been nearly impossible and many roads have been shut down.

Sorry for all of the rambling.  This is one of the most devastating fires we have ever experienced in our little valley and it's a lot to take in.  I expect to have to sift through a lot of ashes and debris in the upcoming days once the closures and evacuations are lifted.

#Finding Loved Ones, Updates, Misc.

If you know someone in the area and have not been able to get ahold of them, you can try visiting [Red Cross Safe & Well](https://safeandwell.communityos.org/zf/safesearch/search) or following \#ErskineFire on Facebook.  For local updates, you can search for Kern County Fire Department's Facebook page or \#ErskineFire on Twitter.  Most of us still don't have cell phone service and internet is very limited to those who don't have satellite connections, so don't be too concerned yet if you haven't heard from anyone.

EDIT:  It looks like there have been 2 confirmed deaths.  I don't know if their names have been released yet.  I won't be able to update very frequently, but I'll add new information below when I can.

**2:06 PM** - If anyone cares, my grandma's house is okay and she was able to go back home.  The fire mostly left her area alone, thankfully.  The hospital was also just barely missed, so my mom is over there right now (she's an RN there).

**3:19 PM** - Added more info above about donations and how to stay updated.

**3:53 PM** - People from Tehachapi donated a large amount of goods for the victims.  I'll try to get some pictures posted, but first, I'm going to see if I can find out why this post was removed.

**4:14 PM** - While I wait to find out why my post was removed, here is a small album of pictures from the generous people in Tehachapi: http://imgur.com/a/18RC5

**4:49 PM** - Valley Estates over in the Kelso Valley area is being advised to evacuate.  The fire hasn't reached them, but the winds and embers are a concern.  Someone reported that firefighters cannot leave the area and a transport vehicle is on fire.

**5:00 PM** - This is one of the places I know of that burned down: http://i.imgur.com/YO80gES.jpg.  We were having so much fun there just last weekend.

**5:38 PM** - The hospital is in the process of being evacuated.  Those with respiratory issues were evacuated earlier and now everyone else is being evacuated because they don't have water and they can't get supplies in there.  No word yet on where they are taking everyone.  They have a lot of older patients in hospice care, so I hope they'll be able to transfer them to a suitable facility.

**7:04 PM** - Well, I'm heading up to Kernville now to drop off food and supplies at the elementary school and then help out at the campground.  Hopefully this comment will become public again soon.  Internet is really spotty up there and I likely won't be able to update very regularly.

**6/26 4:34 AM** - And we're back!  Thank you, mods, for re-approving my comment.  I need to go to bed soon, but I wanted to let everyone know that we have been receiving tons of donations from surrounding cities.  Ridgecrest has been especially helpful and their residents and businesses (even Walmart!) have been sending literal truckloads of supplies for displaced families.  This is only a small sample of what has come our way so far: http://imgur.com/a/YfioZ.  That doesn't even show all of the stuff that we received on Friday and started distributing amongst our refugees as well as the evacuation sites and various neighborhoods.  On a sadder note: approximately 36,000 acres have burned at this time and about 200 homes are known to have been destroyed.  I keep running into more and more people who are now homeless, including some that I know personally.  This has been tough for everyone, but with the generosity of residents from Bakersfield, Tehachapi, Ridgecrest, and even all the way over in Las Vegas, our community is hopeful that we'll somehow manage to recover.  This will likely be my last update, at least for a while, unless I actually get any requests for more information.""When the wind picked up. And the fire spread.

> By and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old camp and laid in a new supply. We were gone all day, and reached home again about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry. While Johnny was carrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our “house” for future use, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot, ashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat to get the frying-pan.
   
> While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny, and looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises! Johnny was on the other side of it. He had to run through the flames to get to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the devastation.

> The ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire touched them off as if they were gunpowder. It was wonderful to see with what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled! My coffee-pot was gone, and everything with it. In a minute and a half the fire seized upon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high, and then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific. We were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained, spell-bound.

> Within half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of flame! It went surging up adjacent ridges—surmounted them and disappeared in the canons beyond—burst into view upon higher and farther ridges, presently—shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove again—flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the mountain-side- -threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and sent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and ribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty mountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava streams. Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy glare, and the firmament above was a reflected hell!

> Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the lake! We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours. We never thought of supper, and never felt fatigue. But at eleven o’clock the conflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness stole down upon the landscape again.You sure that's not the UK right now?One does not simply walk into Mordor.Our firefighters are like, [""Lo there do I see my father""](https://youtu.be/mraO8JZbSkg)I used to summer camp right there.

I grew up in Rancho Santa Fe, California. It was an amazing place to grow up. It is very high income, and the whole area is absolutely beautiful.

When I married my wife, my parents sold me the home for half price as our wedding gift.  I was in absolute shock. So much stress was lifted off of my shoulders in looking for a home. I was so excited that I would be able to give my future children a childhood similar to mine.

Some of you may know about the Witch Fire in 2007. Well, Rancho Santa Fe was unfortunately one of the affected areas, and my home was right in the path of the fire. 

We were evacuated, and I watched in horror as my childhood home, my future and destiny, burned to the ground in a shocking display of natures power and destructive ability.

I was absolutely devastated.  My wife tried to comfort me but it was to no avail.  That house represented so much to me.

I decided I needed to get away from it all.  I went to the ocean and sat there, staring at the tumbling waves and pondering the meaning of life, existentialism... I experienced ego death. We are not truly self-aware. There is no self. Everybody is actually nobody.

I made my way back to the hotel we were staying at, and that's where I experienced another terrifying revelation.  Upon entering my hotel room, I witnessed my wife engaged in passionate lovemaking with the bellhop, him straddling her from behind.

So, if the thief tried to stand, or sit, and get the rope off, the horse just backs up to maintain a taught rope.  That's why the thief is holding onto the tree.

The horse is used to maintaining a taught rope on a cow.

We both spent a summer trapping these bears together, check us out at @grizkid and @jefe_larson on Instagram 

Side note, the drugged bear walked all of the way out of the den and we had to physically stop it until it fell asleep so that it would get hurt or lost while on the drug""Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour, Ursa Major?""That poor bear is scared as hell.  It can't run away and is backed up into the far end of the den.  It has to be the equivalent of an alien abduction for the thing. 

There I was asleep in my bed, when suddenly there was a bright light on my bedroom, and this little pink creature stabbed me with this weird claw on a stick.  I tried to run away but he had me cornered. As he closed the distance between us I tried to fight him off, but I must have blacked out afterwards, and then I woke up with another device implanted in my neck. I went to the bear doctor to have the last one removed, but they were only able to partially remove it. I'm really scared, and I don't feel like I'm in control of my life. 

Edit: typos. Well, at least that guys gonna go on to win an oscarITT: only jokes.

> It has been said that the Ankh is the only river in the multiverse where cops can draw a chalk outline when a corpse is found. 

>There is a legend in Ankh-Morpork of an ancient drum in the palace that will bang itself if ever an enemy fleet is seen sailing up the Ankh, although the legend has died out in recent centuries, partly because it's the Age of Reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the Ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front.There's something alive in there!

No human, far as I could tell, just a german shepherd.

As soon as I walked in, that dog lept off the counter, growling, and ran over to bite me - I thought I was a goner, but it just stood there, holding my pant leg with his teeth.  Then it slowly pulled me towards the door, and I kinda said ""Okay"" and started walking to the door, dog leading me by the pant leg, when I got to the door, it started pushing me.  That's when the (human) owner came out from the bathroom in the back and said ""Oh I see you've met Sandy"".They would instantly become my exclusive hardware distributor. I wouldn't shop around for prices. Anything in my house breaks and I'd be on my way to the dog store. Labs are so kind and helpful and boisterous and they're just my favoriteThis is my favorite thing I've seen on the internet today.Ah , the store dog. Awesome ! Our neighborhood hardware store has a shop cat. All that lazy bastard does is lie on the counter in the sun. And occasionally try to trip customers while escaping out the door.

Still - the neighborhood hardware store is a wonderful place. Little old man or lady who knows where every thing is, even the gizmo they bought in 1947 and never sold. If you have one , cherish it, shop there. Because big box home stores have no souls and often no clue !I hope OP wanted a sprinkler hose, cuz they got one now.Good job pupper. 

Whoops, wrong sub. http://i.imgur.com/xxR7c6P.jpgThere's a gas station in a town I used to live in ran by some hilarious incredibly nice middle eastern dude. He trained his cat to reach out its paw and lower its head to show you respect for a tip, then when you give it a tip it puts it in its mouth (if it's cash) and brings it to him. Or pushes it off the counter into a little red cup if you use change. After that he gives it a treat. 

In Belgium, Wisconsin, the only hardware store in town is also the only liquor store in town.He looks like such a good boy :) I want to give him a treat.Now you can't shop anywhere else ever again. 
*Edit: Can I be someone other than GallowBoob?Do they sell anvils?I grew up in a small town. As a kid I needed a last minute physical so I could play sports in school. Our local doctor wasn't available so we went to an even smaller town nearby where I could see a doctor. The doctor's office had a giant lazy dog lying on the floor of the waiting room. He was breathing so you could tell he was alive but otherwise he gave no indication of life. The doctor was smoking a cigarette with the longest ash imaginable. He asked me, ""Are you healthy?"" I nodded. He said,""ok"" filled out the form and I left. That was the physical.I hope this is true, because that's fuckin' adorable.They used to have seven dogs and a wonderful selection of dark chocolate.Ask him a question please...

Reminds me of a black lab I saw walking with its owner down the high street here in Canterbury. There was an empty plastic bottle on the sidewalk just in front of them. The dog looked up at their owner who then slightly gestured towards the bottle.  Without missing a step, the lab scooped up the bottle and kept on trotting along.

I think the average altitude of Ladakh is somewhere around 14,000 feet.Looks a bit like a Metal Gear Solid V village :D

*This* is why you need to be careful when buying a car not to buy a ""salvage"" title. Cars like this are bought from the owners by the insurance companies, and then some are resold at auction by increasingly unscrupulous people as the car goes down the chain. Soon it appears at a fly-by-night car lot, looking all spiffy... but if you check the title history (via carfax or similar) you'll find the ""flood salvage"" on there. Stay far, far away from such cars.

Letterman had hair?!Still reppin' Ball State, the only thing keeping Muncie, IN alive. 

Edit: Holy turds, I've got some reading to do. Figured a comment about Muncie on reddit would get buried af. Even though I haven't lived there since 1982, Muncie still holds a special place in my heart. I spent summers with my grandparents there growing up. Now I have to get nostalgic for a minute. Lots of fond memories of Pizza King (I'd kill for a Royal Feast right now), the Baskin Robbins and the movie theater it was attached to, cinnamon raisins biscuits from Hardee's, swimming and learning to play golf at the Delaware, trips to Upland to go to Ivanhoe's, Aladdin's Castle at the mall and beef manhattan's from the MCL, the urine stenched slide at Mitchell elementary, watching the cooks make the pizza at Noble Roman's, the children's museum, I'll^just^stahp^here^onions.

Edit #2: Just thought of a story about the first and last time my sister got to see the house my mom grew up in. My parents moved the family to Texas before my sister was born. My mother grew up poor and things were tough for her as a child. Growing up, she wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Muncie and leave it in her past forever. My mother, sister and I had to go back to Muncie for a funeral several years ago. While there, my sister wanted to see where my mom was raised and asked me to drive by, though my mother wanted no part of it. Let's just say the house was east of Broadway and south of McGalliard. I warned her that this would probably only happen once, if it was even still standing. I pulled up and parked out in the street, but told my sister we would not be getting out of the car. We sat for all of two minutes before I sped off, my mom in tears and my sister terrified. ""Neighbors"" started coming out of their homes to case us, yell at us and were rapidly approaching the car to do who knows what. It wasn't a fun trip.Since for some reason no one thought to post a picture of what he used to look like, apparantly assuming everyone in the world has seen his show, I give you this image.

[According to ABC, this picture was taken on his show May 4th, 2015](http://i.imgur.com/znBHbdj.jpg)

I hope that helps.He looks like the guy who used to give me cough medicine that made me sleepy. are.... are those old walkman headphones???http://i.imgur.com/4qrCN9r.gifvThis is understandable. He has looked a certain way for decades (shaven, hair in a certain way, suit) so of course he would want to switch it up now that he has the opportunity. Also he might want some privacy now that he is retired. He was awesome the last few months on air. There were no fucks given!He used to jog around my high school's track in Connecticut. Used to see him all the time. I'd never have guessed that was him.TIL in retirement one ages similar to that of a fruit fly. Santa??Even though you told me that's David Letterman, I'm having a hard time imagining that person as being David Letterman.The Ball State shirt gives it away. That's the first time I've seen him look happy in like 23 yearsJust last night I was watching some old clips of Dave on Youtube.  He was discussing with Jon Stewart how he dislikes shaving.  His excuse was something like, ""I don't like looking at my own face every morning"", and not shaving allowed him to avoid that.

Then my parents took us to the local grade school to get our polio vaccine, it was squirted onto a sugar cube. The whole town turned out. I remember the long lines of people. My memory is that we did this twice, perhaps? 

And my smallpox vaccination, still have the scar from that. [Vaccines made the iron butt obsolete.](http://i.makeagif.com/media/10-28-2014/ZLHQK1.gif)Remember when you got polio? Me neither because vaccinating is greatI struggle to  understand why my kid can not bring peanut butter crackers to school, but other kids can bring measles.
My great-aunt got polio when she was pregnant with her second of four children. She was a bad-ass but she was never able to move around again with a wheelchair or her ""sticks."" 

Her older sister, another great-aunt, died of diphtheria at age six.

This is only a stone's throw away in history. VACCINATE.

P.S. If you want to learn more about what life was like for polio survivors, there's a wonderful memoir by Peg Kehret called Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio. I read it aloud to my son and we both thought it was terrifically interesting.# #BringBackIronLungYou're killing your father, Larry!Am I the only one that wants to turn that in to a bed, like a cocoon bed with wrap around memory foam with cooling gel beads.  Actually modern ventilators and endotracheal intubation made this obsolete because we still need to ventilate people. Still get vaccinated though. Makes me think of radiohead. I work in public health and I still can't believe this is an issue. Parents come in explaining how they aren't gonna put that ""poison"" in their kids. That they're going to just boost the immune system through diet. Measles doesn't care how many vegetables you eat asshole!Is it just me or is anyone else thinking that with a bit of modification that iron lung would be great for smoking a few briskets? Damn, I reckon you could get a whole hog on there.#***AND A GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR***The ""vaccines cause autism"" thing is so messed up. Even if vaccines did cause autism you're admitting you'd rather have your child be dead than autistic. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker!My grandmother had polio as a child and only grew to be 4 ft. 9 inches. It basically crippled her. What a crazy world we live in where people refuse vaccines. So we take away an important part of industry and make many iron lung manufacturers unemployedJackson Hole?

> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto's surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers).

> The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

It's not functional, piping goes straight up, meaning most of the heat goes up the chimeny. No baffling. Dangerously hot to the touch. No ceramic tiles below it means if you open the doors your house will burn down down. Couches are too close with a fabric throw that will go up in flames. Uneven bottom will mean it will be difficult to start a proper fire. Limited (no) intake control (EDIT: Draft, I had a brainfart on that). If it's a real surplus mine it will burn through pretty quickly, constant heat will ruin the integrity of the metal. A season of maple will destroy it. Good luck opening the hatch with metal handles. Also the fire looks fake.

It's an art piece. Pure design without any function. It's a concept, and one I do really like. Looks really great. Take it for what it is.does this look like a painting to anyone else?Looks cool, I'd worry about the lack of any protection underneath shielding the wooden floor.

Sample text from page 1, see page 2 fire some more cool pictures:

> Jeeps were produced and packed this way for shipment to U.S. forces and countries like England and the Soviet Union who the U.S. supplied during WW II. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Richmond, CA, about 70% of production was boxed due to their close proximity to the San Francisco port.

> Boxing up a jeep was expensive and time consuming so it was only done when absolutely necessary. Jeeps that were crated were complete vehicles, not a box of parts — windshields were folded, wheels taken off and a few other things done to minimize the cubeage. Very few, if any, of these crated jeeps remained in the United States, even during the war. After more than sixty years, there are probably none left. Several organizations and dealers have had a substantial reward offer for years for anyone who can produce one and no one has claimed the money.

I was once fishing and was wading into a lake up to my waist.  I had a HUGE alligator snapping turtle come up out of the water and his head was literally RIGHT next to my balls. 

The fucker hung out there for like 30 minutes... then slowly went under the water.  

The water was murky and I couldn't see him when he was under so I had no idea what to do.

I had to wait another hour to leave... was worried about being bitten by bumping into him in the muck.  so one can take a bite out of my leg, and the other can just eat the whole leg pretty much.Stay away from their heads.

""Miller Man"" Maquette of large sculpture for ITW Welded Steel with a marble base 24"" x 7"" x 7"" By David Madero - 

I first used a Spectrum 875 plasma cutter to cut out the initial design from a steel tube. I then used a Millermatic 252 to spot weld steel rods on the tube as a base for the texture and the welding man figure. I continued by welding the gaps and unions between the steel rods leaving a highly texturized surface.  I finished the process using a Diversion 180 tig welder to form puddles giving the hills and valleys appearance.

The baby—named Grace Kelly at the suggestion of a visiting nurse’s wife—was adopted by Carmen’s sister. The aunt also cares for Yoina, who shaved her head in mourning. But the sad events did not stop there. Soon after, Yoina’s pet tamarin was killed when it overturned a boiling pot on itself. The family buried it.

When our reporter Emma Marris went to Manú, she sought out Yoina. The girl still lives with her aunt and helps care for baby Grace. On that visit Yoina had less hair but a bit more of a smile, in gratitude for the gift of a photo with her pet.""By Charlie Hamilton James. He writes: Yoina aged nine with her pet saddle-back tamarin. Last year I was shooting an article for National Geographic Magazine on Manu National Park in the Peruvian Amazon. I had travelled deep into the park to a community called Yomibato, home to indigenous Machiguenga people (aka Matsigenka) as I wanted to look at how Manu’s indigenous people live within the world’s most bio-diverse national park. Every day Yoina and her friends would walk through our camp on the way to the river to swim. The monkey would come with her, even though it hated swimming. To escape the water the tamarin would always try to get onto Yoina’s head, where it felt more secure. Life for Yoina and the tamarin changed dramatically shortly after this image was taken. Their story and the story of Manu features in the June issue of National Geographic Magazine and on the NG website.

Someone educate me... what are the balloon-looking things?  Or are they bombs?  My Dad is somewhere in there. My grandfather was a medic on D-day. He dragged wounded and dead soldiers to the beach and loaded them onto medic boats. I'm going to see him in an hour and I didn't realize what today is until I saw this post. Thank you for reminding me to thank him. Probably the most insane logistical and engineering undertaking in history.an interesting thing about d day is the germans blew up all the docks and the allies anticipated this and build a floating dock that they could boat up to the beach which then served as a unloading point for all their shit... and the germans blew up their shit and the allies sailed their dock in and everything went way easier for the unloading process... it was called mulberry and when i saw this on the history channel the guy said it was one of the most innovative things about the invasionImagine what that must have *sounded* like.Might get buried, but I'm pretty sure that boat 2nd from the left was my grandfather's ship.  LST 309.  Crazy to think he is in the photo somewhereIn *The Complete Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant*, which may be the finest memoirs ever by a U.S. President, Grant devotes many chapters to the Mexican-American War and the U.S. Civil War. This is no surprise. However, to those unfamiliar with the text, it often comes as a surprise how much attention Grant devotes to *logistics*.  In popular imagining, new technologies like machine guns were decisive in the Civil War, but from the point of view of America's top general, such things weren't even worth mentioning. Victory resulted from being able to move his cannons and food to where he wanted them to be.[Meanwhile, back in America](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7493/15944038808_a049f08ec3_h.jpg)[deleted]
""Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:

You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.

Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.

But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.

Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""

James doohanThis is an incredible and amazing photo.  Reading about the landings and that day and the horror of just the one battle, it's a mind blowing thought to me that as safe as these particular soldiers must have felt, they were just getting started with the war.

I can't comprehend how mentally taxing battle must have been.  If you survive, you know there's more coming.  In Stephen Ambrose's book ""D-Day,"" which I highly recommend, he compares the D-Day landings to taking every man, woman, child, vehicle, and supply in Green Bay, Wisconsin—everything in the entire city not bolted down—and moving it across Lake Michigan in 24 hours while under constant fire.Where are all those metal things that you usually see in movies depicting D-day. I think they're called hedgehogs? I thought they were there to prevent lots of vehicles landing on the beach. ""You know those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got?

That looks awesome as a wallpaper for my phone! Thanks for sharing!Photo by [Frank White Bull](http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/198392/)Time to call Sam and DeanI grew up in the Chicago area, but lived in Mitchell, SD for a year. As much as I thought we had it bad for weather, SD was just ridiculous. It gets hotter in the summer, colder in the winter, and the storms (winter and summer) are wilder. Snow plows running every week, signs getting blown off buildings, flickering lights, snowing in October and May, rain clouds that looked like armageddon. They were beautiful, though. Like the people from Independence Day looking up at those ships in awe as the beam gradually forms and decimates everything.[deleted]I like the look of the photo, but I wonder how green that really is because I have seen skies that have that eerie sea green that I just know hail is coming my way.  The midwest is a terrifyingly beautiful part of America.I have experienced one of these South Dakota summer storms, probably around about this time of year, too. We were camping in Badlands NP. Temps had reached 116 that day, too hot and humid to move. That night, the bellowing wind bent the tent sideways; after we'd held it up from the inside for what seemed like an hour, we made a run for the car, sleeping bags in tow. From there we were witness to an almighty thunderstorm, lightning striking all over the visible sky, as a backdrop of 80s rock songs played on the car radio. The storm finally passed around 6am, and we returned wearily to our tent, which had somehow survived. It was terrifying at the time, but made for an amazing adventure for two Brits not used to such monumental storms! We loved our time in and around the Black Hills.*What a glorious day!*Yay!

I've seen countless Great Plains storms over many years, from Texas to Canada, at humidity level extremes and in all seasons, and not a single one ever displayed heavy-handed unsharp masking or color saturation.

Looks like it was referring to the camp grounds- Most are only open from mid-October to mid-April. Not sure about back countryAt the beginning of August 2001 I rode through Death Valley on my BMW.  I'm from Seattle and not used to heat over 80-ish.  I had spent the night in Yosemite and took 395 down to Death Valley.  Here I pulled off just before entering the valley proper to take a pic, I had a couple people slow and ask if I was okay.

Up and over Towne Pass at 4,956 feet which was 66 degrees and down a 5 mile stretch to the valley floor.  So in 5 minutes it goes from 66 to 124 degrees.  I stopped at Stovepipe Wells to call and make arrangements with family in L.A. that evening.  They asked if I was okay since I was somewhat gasping for air.  Had some water, bought some more, dumped some down my riding gear (ATGATT!).

I continued on to Furnace Creek, about 25 miles.  About halfway there I could really feel the heat and suddenly understood how people get crazy in the desert and wander in circles.  I actually had to tell myself to keep going.  I did get to Furnace Creek and bought 6 liters more water and drank 2.  It was 130 degrees, here I am redfaced from heat.

I was about to take off and a cyclist with touring gear pulls in.  ""I'm from Phoenix so it's okay"" was his response to my look of disbelief.

I continued on to Zabriske Point for another pic but could already feel the heat lifting a tad.

Continuing east out of Death Valley I figured the worst was over, um right.  It was 118 at Death Valley Junction when I turned on to highway 127 to go south.  The next 80 miles just sucked.  It wasn't crazy-inducing heat, but it was really robbing me of energy.  This really was the 'turn the oven on broil, open the door, and stick your head in front of it' moment.  If I went fast it just felt hotter, like a blast furnace.  So I held at around 60mph.  Got to Baker at I-15 and it was 116.

And then a relatively comfortable 200 miles to Manhattan Beach.  I got off the bike, took the helmet off, and almost gagged on how much I reeked!  All told a 600 mile day, whew!

If you're ever in this heat treat it seriously!
I was at Ft. Irwin in the mid 90's and the last three days of our training cycle it hit 127 each day. We did have those fancy desert unis. We got to wear the black and dark green European unis that let the air flow like a garbage bag. Someone mentioned that the wind feels like a hairdryer. Very true. We'd have the doors off the Hummv and it did feel like staring at a hairdryer. Good times!

Edit: Link & Link2 are spamy on smartphones.  Stick with Link3, it really is the best.Fun fact, the French government allows tax relief to shepherds who voluntarily provide and maintain sheep on plots of land that are believed to have a number of undetonated mines. The idea is that without putting human lives at risk, sheep can detonate landmines over time while the owner of the sheep is compensated for the possibility of losing said sheepIt is absolutely mind boggling the scales of WW1 and WW2. I have traveled around much of Europe and South East Asia, retracing troop movements and big battles. Some of the places seem like it just took place in the past decade. The sheer size of these wars are just simply unimaginable. Reminds me of the final episode of Blackadder :'-(That is beautiful, but also quite eye opening.  I imagine you could spend an afternoon digging around in there, and you are pretty much guaranteed to find some soil.Ah yes, the trenches of Beaumont-Hamel. The 1st Royal Newfoundland Regiment's probably more well known battles. July 1st, 9:15am, of the 780 men, all from the 1RNR involved in the 3rd wave of attacks (all attacks before completely failed), only 110 survived, and only 68 were available for roll call next morning. This picture is just East of the Caribou Memorial for the 1RNR. By the looks of the craters this was a German trench because a week before the charge, the Allies bombarded the German line with artillery and mortar. Unfortunately it did not weaken their defenses.[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont-Hamel_Newfoundland_Memorial) is the story of this trench.Some scars never heal completely[deleted]Were the trenches originally straight and they have eroded over time, or were they dug like that? Considering the fronts weren't moving much and it was essentially feeding meat into a grinder from both sides ... just imagine how many people died in that picture alone over those 4 years. :/If the landmines are all gone, that would be one hell of a playground.[Welcome to the lovely Cercen Pass.]  (http://i.imgur.com/mLSXLBt.jpg)  Where you can still find many remnants of the oft-forgotten Frozen War of the Alps.

The Italians established many gun positions and camps [on mountaintops like these.](http://i.imgur.com/JSCO29y.jpg)

The Austria efforts were equally Sisyphean.  [On Marmolada, the highest mountain in the Dolomites,](http://i.imgur.com/n88KSic.jpg) the Austrian Corps of Engineers built an entire ""ice city""—a complex of tunnels, dormitories, and [storerooms dug out of the bowels of the glacier.](http://i.imgur.com/Iu2H7gM.jpg)  Only to lose it to the Italians.  Who in turn lost it the next winter to the combined Austrian/German forces.  In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.

.

We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie

In Flanders fields.


.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.And every hole is where an artillery shell hit, its really astonishing to look at Verdun and other sections of north-eastern France and Belgium.

Fun fact, their still digging up undetonated land mines, shells and grenades from that area (The red zone i think its called) so about 102 years of cleaning.Australians died there. Motherfucking Australians from the other side of the damn world. Imagine if the Grand Canyon was originally a trench for giantsThis might be a good time to mention The Great War on YouTube is covering WW1 week by week as it was 100 years ago with added bonus videos.

And no I don't work for them it's really that good.There's a BBC documentary called ""The First World War From Above""  that's currently on US Netflix (and, apparently, [also on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH8C_CIdmk8)) that does a great job of exploring the scars that the trenches and battles of WWI left on Europe. Well worth a watch.to put the First world war into perspective, there is a 1 foot thick layer of iron stained soil which stretches across parts of France and Belgium which is entirely composed of shrapnel and debris from the war. 

the trenches, shell craters and structures may erode away, but the layer of war will remain for millennia below the surface. Pictures from WWI continue to amaze me and instill a sense of humbleness and pride (being Canadian, and all). I have been fortunate enough to visit Vimy Ridge and the surrounding area twice. The first time the monument was being restored, so thankfully I was able to go again a couple years ago. It was a great experience, and I highly suggest anyone go if you get the chance. From what I remember, the tours at Vimy Ridge are free; you just sign up for a time when you get there. I also suggest renting a car and just driving all over. You will stumble upon many different WWI and WWII sites that are must-sees. Can't wait to go back!

Even though this will be buried, if anyone is interested in seeing pictures, feel free to ask.There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools, singing at night,

And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,

Would scarcely know that we were gone.

- Sara TeasdaleWell how do you do now, you Willie MacBride?
Do you mind if I sit down beside your graveside
And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun?
I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done 

Well I see by your gravestone you was only nineteen
When you joined the great fallen of nineteen sixteen
Well I hope you died well and I hope you died clean
Or Willie MacBride was it low and obscene? 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Did you leave a young wife or a sweetheart behind?
In some faithful heart are your memories enshrined?
For although you died back in nineteen sixteen
In that faithful heart you're forever nineteen 

Or are you a stranger without even a name
Enclosed forever behind a glass pane
In an old photograph tor, battered and stained
Faded to yellow with brown leather frayed?


Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

As the sun beats down on the green fields of France
There's a soft summer breeze makes the red poppies dance
And see how the sun shines from under the clouds
There's no gas, there's no barbed wire, no guns firing now 

Oh but here in this grave yard it's still no man's land
The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand
And through man's blind indifference to his fellow man
To a whole generation who were butchered and damned 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest? 

Now Willie MacBride, I can't help wonder why
All those that lie here now why did they die?
And did they believe when they answered the call
Did they really believe tat this war could end wars? 

Oh the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain
The killing and dying, 'twas all done in vain
For, Willie MacBride, oh it happened again
And again and again and again and again 

Did they beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band sound the last post and chorus?
Did they pipe the flowers of the forest?

Cus it get cold like Minnesota.It's a lovely picture, but a little editing would really help bring it out.  Some noise reduction, especially in the shadows, would help clean up the tones and a little bump in contrast and clarity would help it pop.

[I gave it a little play in photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/YWPZVHE.jpg) - mainly what I said and also straightening the lines up a little.    There wasn't a whole lot I could do with the low-res JPEG.  

Editing is a very important part of the photographic process.  Getting the image as correct as possible in camera is great, but editing is almost always needed to tidy it up.  

Another little tip, is that print you've had done on canvas?  Get it printed on good quality semi-gloss paper and framed (even a really cheap, basic frame) and it'll do the image the justice it deserves.  You could probably get it printed on decent paper for $10-15, and a frame like [this](http://www.therange.co.uk/fashion-black-box-frame//the-range/fcp-product/51577) - with the photo either window-mounted or at least with a white border between the image and frame.

Got my neighbors cat instead. I was scared to death to open it. That cat was acting like a bag of razor blades. The expression on the dog's face conveys ""......dammit.""""I have made a huge mistake.""Now do the humane thing and release it in a meadow.My parents got a trap to catch feral cats in our backyard. They ended up with a raccoon instead. They (immigrants from Asia) asked me if raccoons can be kept as pets... What is your plan if you catch a skunk?That's why dogs won't eat vegetables, it's a trap.Set out a trap to catch an offending cat that was spraying our front door. Came home and found the neighbors cat sitting in the cage. It had eaten the tuna then it took a nap.

We knew this was not the offender so we released her and set up the trap again. Come home the following day and the same cat is in the cage again sleeping. Gave up.For real, thank you for checking your live trap regularly. I work in lawn care and have seen some gruesome stuff that could have been prevented by some simple awareness. He seems strangely ok with it.Ha that's how I got my first cat.

One day, at work, I found some shit in the rag bin on the counter in the shop. We called in the pest guy, and he thought that maybe we had a coon hiding around somewhere. So he set up a live trap and we left it over night. The next morning when I got to work there was this little black and white furball in the trap. Such a cute little thing. I didn't have the heart to bring it to the pound. I asked my coworkers for some help with the vet bills which helped a ton. I didn't have a carrier at the time so I brought him to the vet in the live trap. One of the questions the vet asked me was what his temperament was like. I said, well I have only known him for an hour or so but I think he is pretty scared right now. 

That was four years ago and he is doing great.For Groundhogs I've found that bell peppers work best.That's no whistle pig.He looks so pissed lol.http://i.imgur.com/hwzx56E.jpgNope... that is NOT a happy pup. HahaI have just caught 2 groundhogs who were doing quite a bit of damage to my garden.  I had good luck using cantaloupe as bait.  I cut it in small pieces and made a trail to the trap. Looks like you caught a Groun*dog*...

That's all I've got.That is pretty lucky, my buddy caught a skunk with the same trap.    

I've been catching groundhogs for years now (I have 5-7 at any given time in my yard).    A few tips:
*Cantaloupe is the best bait.   I have tried everything else, any time I put cantaloupe in a cage I catch them on the same day. 

*Only set the trap during the day.   Groundhogs are active during the day, raccoons and skunks are active at night.  Although the chicken wire solution someone else mentioned should work.   Remember they always have at least 2 entrances to their burrow. 

*Make sure it is ok to actually use this trap in your state.   Some states it is illegal to transport the groundhog because they are a rabies ""vector"" species.  Also they will supposedly travel up to 5 miles to get back.   I don't know about that, but I had one travel about a mile.   I use a .22 to the head after I catch them.   That way I don't kill my neighbor's dog/cat, but I don't have to worry about the groundhog again.    Skunks are the big risk.  He regret nuffin.He looks like he got caught cheating on his diet...When I was a kid, a buddy and I tried to trap some rabbits like this, just for fun.  It wasn't a real trap, but just an animal cage that we rigged up to slam shut and lock.

Instead of rabbits, we accidentally caught three baby skunks and had to call animal control.  Parents were not pleased.","{'Sadness': 0.043413, 'Emotional_Range': 0.818, 'Tentative': 0.826, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.869636, 'Analytical': 0.07, 'Conscientiousness': 0.317, 'Agreeableness': 0.753, 'Joy': 0.057014, 'Disgust': 0.135217, 'Extraversion': 0.637, 'Openness': 0.141, 'Anger': 0.839525}",{}

When I was first using a Dremel, I thought ""do I really need to wear these safety glasses? I'll wear them anyway just in case"" and then as I was working debris was  hitting me in the glasses and I thought ""those could be my eyes"" These cutoff discs are no joke.  They are designed to be used in a specific way (straight through cutting using the disc edge) but they are frequently used incorrectly (such as grinding using the face of the disc) which can lead to this sort of failure, with high speed shrapnel spraying in every direction.  Even if used properly, if you don't pay attention and the kerf closes on the blade, thus binding it up, you will get a rapid unplanned disassembly of the disc.

tl;dr use these cutoff discs for straight-on cutting only.  Wear a full face shield.[This is what would happen if he wore regular glasses](https://gfycat.com/HappyQuickDiplodocus)We require all employees to wear this:

I'm actually  impressed with peoples increased awareness and use of safety glasses, hearing protection, helmets and other gear even if NOT required.  I mean, it's there to protect you.. and something you usually can't replace like an eye or brain.  

Still, there's always ""that guy"" who doesn't want to use any of it for [insert rather inane reason here].  As an M.D. they keep me in business, but I'd rather they didn't.  So remember kids, 15 seconds of putting on safety gear can save you a lifetime of injury.  Now you know.  And knowing is half the battle.   *oh, damn cartoons*Wow I have an angle grinder and I'll never use it without glasses ever again.

That's terrifying.Although I have no experience with cutting discs such as this, I do vividly recall a few years ago using a table saw for the first time. I did not have proper instruction nor did I review of how to use it, had a piece of wood kick back and hit me right in the stomach.

I don't play around with tools anymore, I rigidly stick to the safety instructions and refuse to use a tool without understanding it better first. Could have avoided a nice punch to the gut had I just taken 10 to 15 minutes that day. Could be a lot worse depending on the tool you're using.I work in a Cnc grind shop with few conventional machines and shit like this gives me nightmares.

While it is very beautiful and sweet smelling, its has the ability to escape its ornamental confines in vine form, and then establish itself in the wild, where its aggressive vines creep around the forest floor, choking and out-competing many native understory species. Furthermore, sizable trees have been killed by those creeping Wisteria vines. When these large trees are killed, it opens the forest floor to sunlight, which allows the Wisteria seedlings to grow and flourish even more. 

Also, anyone who wants to see a good list of invasive species that are often sold at garden centers you should *definitely* avoid planting in your yard (depending on your zone), see [THIS LIST](http://imgur.com/a/PCLez) I made. If anyone DOES want to plant Wisteria, I would recommend [American Wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria_frutescens), which is just as beautiful, but does not have the invasive predisposition the Asian varieties do. The reason the Asian varieties are favored in ornamental application is because they emit a very intoxicating fragrance, while American Wisteria does not.

Edit: clarity

per /u/DonTago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2nvdjn/bonsai_wisteria/cmhi32q)Reminds me of Flumes album cover They must cut that thing hourly. Wisteria grows stupid fast.If I thought I had any chance of keeping one of those alive...

I kill everything indoors. The only things to survive me so far are snake plants. I ordered seeds for this on amazon. After a few weeks I got a notice that they had been confiscated.  

Edit:  I gave no indication of wanting to grow a bonsai with them. I'm aware seedlings aren't appropriate for bonsai. I did not know they were invasive when I tried to purchase them, now I do.

Little stinker Looks like a Tribble.Animal control officer here.

Skunks, at least here in my part of Texas, are the number one carrier of rabies. As many as 2/3rds of skunks tested return positive results. It's not likely the baby has it, but it is possible. It's spread through the saliva and mother animals tend to clean their young with their tongues so while unlikely, it CAN be spread without requiring a bite or scratch.

The virus likely wouldn't survive long on the baby's fur but I'd still exercise caution. Wash your hands thoroughly. Don't rub your eyes or pick your nose. This is assuming you made sure you had no open cuts on your hand before handling it.

Baby skunks are kind of case-by-case when it comes to spraying. Some of them won't do it at all while others will lift their tails and spin around like a garden sprinkler. Approached carefully, most skunks won't even spray.

If you notify your local animal control agency, just a heads up, they'll very possibly treat this as an exposure and, for your own safety, euthanize the skunk and submit it to be tested for rabies.

As if students would be expected to scale the lockers like monkeys.I must be really tired. On my first look of this picture I was like ""what the hell kind of filing system is that?""[another angle](http://i.imgur.com/EalsdzO.gifv)The partially open lockers give it away though. They should be swung all the open, no?If the person dangling by the door had put a small block around their hip area, they would look like they were dangling from the middle of the door instead of the side, and we'd never see the block.  That's about the only thing I would change.  Otherwise it is a very well done image.  How are the bottles and books even in that position?Welp, that took an embarrassingly long time for me to figure out. :/I don't see it?

Typically when members of military orders are buried, their stone relief would have their legs crossed if they had fought in the holy land, and their legs apart if they had not served in the Holy Land. If this soldier was a member of a unit that fought in the Crusades, there is a chance he did not serve in the Holy land personally. You should cross post this to r/cemeteryporn.

I petted him and went on my way, but he ended up following me home. I grabbed a leash, and walked him around the neighborhood, hoping that he would lead me to his home. 

After about an hour or two, the sun was starting to go down, and I just started knocking on doors up and down the streets, asking ""Is this your dog? Do you know whose it is?"". After about another hour of doing that, I finally found someone who knew the dog, and directed me to the owners house. 

Turns out he had somehow snuck out of the house, and the family had been worried sick about him, since he was somewhat old, and had a lazy eye (don't worry, I ended up carrying him when he tuckered out from all the walking). The look of joy on the family's and the dogs face when they were reunited is something that I wouldn't trade for anything.

Beautiful reunion beneath the stars.FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WILL SOMEONE TELL THAT DOG HE IS A GOOD BOY!!!Poor dog, I'm glad he meet his owner again. If that was my dog, I'd first hit the side of the bus as it drove away in hopes of the driver stopping it. If that didn't work, whatever pair of shoes I was wearing would instantly become running shoes.I had my dog run off the elevator on the wrong floor of our building.  One of his dog buddies lives on that floor, and he must have caught the scent and got confused.  By the time I made it to the next floor, ran to the stairs and up a flight, he was huddled against the elevator doors, shaking (he was an abandoned dog that we rescued).  I felt just as bad as he did, so when we got back from our walk I made him a strip of bacon.Is there a source to this story? So I can put my mind at ease about the dog finding his/her human again.>Someone pls halp. I am no bus dog Oops, that dog got on the bus without the owner. Lets look out the window, it would be way to awkward to try to explain this to the driver - 99% of Finland Oh so I guess I'm crying today.He looks so scared like he misses his parent-figure. My dog freezes up like this when he's scared. How did the driver not notice? Why didn't other passengers speak up to stop the bus? Uuuggghh!!This is so heartbreaking, glad he was reunited with his ownerI feel like I understand this dog so much/r/thisismylifenowTorilla tavataan.I'm really glad this story had a happy endingLooks just like my pupper

My stepdad built and flew experimental kit helicopters, as did some of his friends. We lived in a semi-rural area, and regularly his friends would come over in a helicopter. Not that they lived far away, just something they did. My mom and my stepdad actually got married in a helicopter, hovering over the ceremony at our house while the minister did the ceremony over walkie-talkie.

As a youngster I always wanted him to come pick me up from school via rope ladder and helicopter, but he wouldn't ever do it. Good fuckn yard12 seconds later, on eBay...I would've googled ""how to fly a helicopter"" and try to see if I could fly it. You should be better friends with Francis.OP, I need to know why a random man in a helicopter wanted to see Francis.  Please update.  Thank you.I would walk out with an old iPod and tell him it's a hundred bucks.  When he asks what you are talking about, just say you thought he was the guy from Craigslist who was gonna buy the iPod.  He said he was coming in a red helicopter.  Then just shrug and say 'Weird coincidence.' And walk back in the house like it never happened.Here's the same helicopter flying in America! https://s3.amazonaws.com/mfbimages/logbook/images/aircraft/id/5991/20110117082408195282_.jpg

Guy gets out the back and says to me casually, ""I'm looking for Francis.""

Francis lives 3 houses away, so I point him in the right direction.

""Okay, thanks,"" he says, walking that way. Then he turns back to me and says, ""Okay, if I leave the helicopter here?""

""Yeah, no problem,"" I say.

And he goes off to see Francis. Leaves his helicopter.

For some context, according to [here on March 7, 2016](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/05/us/brothers-win-lottery/):

> Earlier this week, the judge, James Stocklas, and his brother, Bob, bought lottery tickets on the way home from the beach. James Stocklas, 67, won the $291 million Powerball and his brother won $7.

> After Wednesday's drawing, the judge had returned to work, and was sitting at the restaurant where he eats breakfast every day. He happened to check the numbers on his phone and realized he'd won. To celebrate, he bought breakfast for everyone in the restaurant, and called his family to say, ""We are going back to Florida!""

> The Florida lottery noted the double winners by printing Bob Stocklas a full-size winner's check.

>James Stocklas chose the lump sum payment of $191 million, the Florida Lottery said. There's no word on whether he'll bring his brother back to Florida with him.It's extra funny that they gave Bob one of those giant checks for a $7 prize, which cost at least $50 for a smaller size one than that.Being a good brother, he shared: $3.50 is a nice present.""Hey bro, now we've got two hundred and ninety one million, four hundred thousand AND SEVEN dollars! What'll we do?""

""Nice try Bob!""James gets everything bob doesn't! The lottery, a few extra inches of height, a neck, and a mustache First Mom had a favorite, now fortune does tooHonestly If I took home 191 million dollars in a lottery, I'd make my brother a hideously rich person too, and I'm pretty sure he'd do the same for me. 

I can't imagine what i'd do with that much money and I've seen what happens to people who piss it all away, and I know he wouldn't waste it, so I like to think I'd manage it a little better than you hear about, but I'd definitely give a lot of it away.

Honestly when I think of 191 million dollars I think of how much satisfaction giving half of it away to various people and charities would get me. That's about the only way money buys happiness on its own.

Plus the things I want in life are comparatively inexpensive, and having free time is something I would value more than anything else, so I could fill it with doing things I want to do instead of things I otherwise had to do. I could spend so much more time with people, working on things that I'm passionate about.

More than anything, I look at all the ways people close to me have helped me in my life, and being able to return that 100 fold is the thing that makes me fantasize about being rich someday.What are the odds that they would both win on the power ball?Secret Santa at the Stocklas house was a bit awkward that year.More like Bob Stock*less* am I right? Right?Did he share? Cause fuck Bob that's why.  Somebody tell Bernie. I hope he gives his brother a few million.They both agreed to split their winnings 50/50.

>Hey, Bob.  Let's split your winnings first.  I'm gonna need about half.  
>Goddamn Lock Ness Monster!""They're both winners in my eyes."" - momDamn. Bob must be bummed. James gets the cash AND the height. And that sick mustache.

Is it size dependent?Can someone ELI5 how the water that makes up this iceberg is so blue?  Like, bluer than you would think that amount of ice should be.It wants a belly rub.Where's Aang and Appa?Can someone please ELI5 why the ice appears blue if it has been on the bottom of the iceberg. Not sure an iceberg has a bottom or top.  I would argue that since it has settled in this position, we are now looking at the top of the iceberg...Icebergs that are a deep blue like that are actually over a million years old.

So if that's the case we're all looking at a chunk of ice that could very well be from times much different then they are now Can you see Jack?
Huh. I would have thought that the 90% part would be larger...Club Penguin finally did it! Why does it look like a golf ball, with the dents and stuff?I want to lick it.Aang?That is not an iceberg, it is a berg bit or growler.hIcenbergi love that colorI thought the bottom of the iceberg could only be accessed via TOR. Did you search it for the avatar?And that's just what you can see of it. There's a whole 'nother 10% below the surface..Damn I remember this picture from like 4 or 5 years ago.

When we moved from 100m to 200m, someone forgot to move their equipment as well. Of course someone took a shot at the helmet left behind, and let me just tell you:

These helmets are **not** designed to stop a 7.62 bullet from an assault rifle. Clean through...http://gfycat.com/AlarmingSolidBoar marine had a sniper round ricochet off his helmet. When I was in Afghanistan, my buddy had something similar happen, except a piece chipped off and slashed his eye open and now he's blind in one eye. Wow.  All by itself, just seeing the many killed and wounded has to give you a new appreciation for life.  But then to come this close to death yourself.  Talk about high on life.im glad to know that he is ok but god damn i feel bad for him. just because the round was stopped does not mean he didn't feel anything. the concussive force alone is hell on the body!I'd say that was either a holopoint round from the shooters pistol that failed to penetrate or a glancing blow from the rifle. No way is a Kevlar helmet stopping a .223/.556 dead on. The man wearing this helmet should go buy a lottery ticket immeditly... You have been banned from /r/news.And this is why certain departments have ""militarized"" equipment. A year ago all police with this gear were Nazis. My my, the shoe is now on the other hand.I will now always buy a Kevlar helmet in CS: GO.Seriousley, ist about time to wipe ISIS out of this Galaxy.This is really interesting and shows the deflective properties of kevlar very well. Note that the spalling damage spreads out so widely - this is because the energy is being dissipated across a large area, which reduces damage done to one specific spot. This has the upside of reducing damage to the helmet's wearer, but the downside that even fairly minor damage will seriously compromise the integrity of the armor.

Similar problems/benefits exist in motorcycle and bicycle helmets.Also assume he had an NVG plate that absorbed some of the energy.""How is that a hit marker?!""My wifes unlce just got into our local swat team after being on the force for 20 years.

Cool, do you know what year this was taken?I sincerely thank you for this. For some weird reason, who this model was has haunted me for years.

Our light output definitely did not contribute to any of the pinprick splotches in this image. In fact, my dad was kind of stereotypically strict about electricity usage in our house. To the point that he'd unscrew lightbulbs in our rooms at night. It probably only saved him a few dollars a year.

Once I was a teenager, I realized that this was pretty unusual behavior, and I became increasingly upset at him about it. I decided that I wanted to get back at him, so I figured out how to jimmy open a lightbulb, so that the glass bulb was completely separate. Then I collected some dog shit, liquefied it in the coffee grinder, and poured it into the bulb he used in his bedroom.

I'm not sure what I expected to happen, but the bulb exploded almost immediately and coated his bed in dog shit. He whooped my ass, but he still made coffee the next morning, so I won.Anyone make a combo map of this with an overlay of the state/country lines?

http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Bellaire-teen-may-be-shark-bite-victim-5540361.php
Tuesday, June 10, 2014

A Bellaire teenager is wearing the mark of what is believed to be a weekend encounter with a shark. 
Mikaela Amezaga, 14, acquired the half-moon, mirror image skin breaks that resemble a wide-mouth shark bite on her back around 6:30 p.m. Saturday while swimming near the Isla Del Sol community on the west end of Galveston Island.

Daniel Amezaga said his daughter was in waist-deep water when she felt something bump her upper body from behind.
""She was a little ways out. She went there to cool off,"" he said. ""After a few minutes, she came out and said she felt something on her back.""

When Mikaela moved her sticky-wet hair aside, her relatives saw blood dripping. Only after seeing their reactions did the teen begin to cry.

a few Quotes: ""I couldn't believe it,"" Daniel Amezaga said. ""It could have been a leg or arm. It definitely could have been worse. We have a smaller child, and there were a bunch of kids there.""


""We see sharks all the time,"" Daniel Amezaga said. ""Usually, they're after fish - not people.""

""It happens when people maybe get mixed up with schooling fish like mullet. You get that quick bite and release because the shark thinks it's a fish,"" said Peter Davis from Beach Patrol, ""When they realize it's not a fish, they let go.""

Remember the '90s, when everyone was pickling their own vegetables and brewing their own beer? People were growing out their mutton chops, and waxing their handlebar mustaches?

*The '90s?*

Yeah, everyone was knitting and sewing clothes for their children. People were wearing glasses all the time, like contact lenses had never been invented...

*Wait... are we talking about the 1990s?*

[No, the 1890s](https://vimeo.com/36293215).Wish I had known sooner.I'm seeing them in Austin!….Portland…Portland….Portland...[deleted]Fuck. i missed Liz Phair.Do you want to be a polyester bride?Fire up the batmobile will ya?Put a bird on it. Ohhh...Liz Phair...you lovely little woman.

Damn, did I have the BIGGEST crush on her back in the 90s.I really wanted to go to this in my city, but the tickets were fucking pricey. $65 and that's before fees. Normally I don't complain about ticket prices, but I saw the Pumpkins with Manson just last year here for only $20. It sucks because I wanna see Liz Phair too, but it's a steep price since I'm not a huge Pumpkins fan.I didn't know the Smashing Pumpkins was an 1890's bandFrom looking at the posts, I will say I saw SP in the 90's with Swervedriver when I was in high school. Great show. My ex-wife turned me on to Liz Phair though and at this point I would want to see her more than the Pumpkins.  Both are great bands though.

How hard is it to train a dog like that? Have always heard a lot about wolf hybrids being very stubborn and very much their own.

I have two dogs and really want to hike with them but anytime they are off leash or out of a fenced area they are gone. Edit: Spelling Not to be a Debbie Downer here, but you’re crazy if you let her run around the woods without a very bright vest on.  In many states, coyotes are always in season, and with the recent growth of Northern Coyotes (a larger wolfish coyote), she becomes a target.  Please have her wear a bright colored vest so hunters will realize that she is not a wild animal.  Must be tough lugging a dead tree around the Appalachian Mountains.

Bird at the top \*almost\* ruined the shot.  Awesome photo!Oh, the final lap around the internet...While stationed in Groton, CT, once you've completed Basic Enlisted Submarine School, or BESS, it was typical to have to wait months for your rating's 'A' school to commence class due to the influx of post-9/11 recruits, so we were given menial jobs to do around base. Mine happened to be one of the best you could ask for: Tour guide and part-time custodian for the Nautilus Submarine History Museum right outside the front gate. And during the winter it was practically dead, so I did little more than babysit the museum's brand-new barely-required metal detector and occasionally police the parking lot for trash. 

Well the museum's also equipped with a dock, where, under normal circumstances, the actual submarine Nautilus, the first American nuclear sub, would be moored as part of the tour, but, unfortunately, until further notice, the sub was in dry-dock for repainting and various maintenance and the dock remained empty. So the other guides took to tossing bread into the Thames River to lure swans and other waterfowl. There is nothing quite as breathtaking as seeing a pure white swan floating atop its own reflection while veritable streams of snow come wafting down around it. Like it's something straight out of a dream, how peaceful it looks. 

TL;DR: While stationed at New London Subase, I saw this firsthand, and it is gorgeous beyond words. http://karmadecay.com/r/pics/comments/4kr86n/a_man_feeding_swans_in_the_snow_by_marcin_ryczek/krakow! this pic has been posted so many times to reddit..This looks so staged!

http://i.imgur.com/2Y5Gsvw.jpgThat was one of the best things I've ever watched. That one little guy with his grocery bags as the tank kept trying to go around him, and he kept shuffling from side to side as they did. It was a remarkable sight.Someone once said, that this picture shows two heroes.  The most obvious is the man standing in defiance.  Maybe not as obvious, the tank pilot who would not plow over his own countrymen. Does anyone think we'll ever figure out what his fate was?Ironically, half way across the world in another communist country, Poland had its first (semi-)free elections. The same exact day as the Tiananmen Square massacre.

In my opinion, 1989 was a crazy year overall:
- Exxon Valdez oil spill 
- Pablo Escobar blowing up a civilian aircraft
- The fall of the Berlin Wall
- Brazil held its first presidential elections in 29 years
- The Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan

In other news, It's been 27 years since CNN committed an act of journalism.The story of how this photographer got the images out of China is just as cool.

Just want to say thank you to everyone for letting the world know.How would the world be different today if the tank had just not stopped and ran the guy over?  >Why don't you ask the kids in Tiennamen Square, was fashion the reason why they were there?

I had a professor in college that was there during the whole protest. He showed us pictures that blew my mind. Like from the upper level of the Monument to the People's Heros showing how many people were there.  He had been there with a group of students and he said it was very questionable whether they were going to be allowed to leave. He smuggled something like a dozen rolls of film out with him. He was really worried that it was a bad idea and that he may get detained and have to let the students leave by themselves but he knew that it was important that the images got out.

The artist owns the foundry, so that would save *some* money (if he was donating it) but still not cheap.I can't imagine this was just 'dumped' in front of the parliament. It is a pretty serious piece of art. I am thinking quite a bit of organisation went into transporting it here from where ever it previously was. 

Dumped to me implies it was done with no thought to what would become of it.I assume that statue was transported there using a horse team and wagon?When? Now?This reminds me of when I was growing up in Iowa, a horse on pain killers for cataracts reared up during a thunder storm and impailed itself on a iron fence post. I found it the next morning as he was bleeding out. That was a little rough as a young kid.....Looks like it was carefully placed.

That said, dump it in front of your house. We are all responsible, double so if you have a kid (seriously, you are why there's going to be no more polar bears if you had a kid, good job). 

Our lifestyles cause this. We aren't going back. We are unwilling and it's likely too late anyway, but other than a hypocritical message, I find this piece very compelling.ITT: Everyone's an art critic.How do you just dump an aged bronze statue?but what about the polar bear?","{'Sadness': 0.047352, 'Emotional_Range': 0.846, 'Tentative': 0.458, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.778045, 'Analytical': 0.483, 'Conscientiousness': 0.106, 'Agreeableness': 0.319, 'Joy': 0.040802, 'Disgust': 0.045594, 'Extraversion': 0.478, 'Openness': 0.393, 'Anger': 0.96082}",{'statue': 0.377541}

This was a carefully staged filming of Cameron delivering a campaign speech for broadcast during the last election campaign. So, just party people and handpicked locals so there wouldn't be any shouting and unscripted moments during the delivery. It is what it is, a staged event for a purpose. Using a hundred or so picked people for a speech that was broadcast to millions.

He HATED this award, as he felt that it was given to him as an ""Add-On"" to the Oscars that year. Snow White was not nominated for Best Picture when everyone thought that it should have been, including Walt. Hearing that he wasn't very happy about that, and then being given this ""Not Really Best Picture"" award really changes the way that I hear his voice when Shirley Temple gives it to him. I can hear him being a little facetious about it now. Despite knowing, I still went ahead counted the smaller Oscars...[Magical.](http://i.imgur.com/8zGNSJU.gifv)I wonder if there are any other special Oscars...Does it bother anyone else that the steps of the first six dwarfs (going left to right) is on a separate piece of wood from the last dwarf? Why not just sculpt from one large piece? Or is it just an illusion from the way it was carved? Don't talk to me or my sons ever againSnow White was the first feature length animated film, Disney literally bet the company on it and everyone thought he was good as bankrupt.

The success of the film not only established animation as a ""real"" movie format, but the financial success allowed him to build the studio lot that Disney still occupies today.

In fact, the prominent [""Team Disney"" building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_\(Burbank\)#/media/File:Teamdisneyburbankbuilding.jpg) on the studio lot features the Seven Dwarfs holding up the roof in an homage to the movie simultaneously establishing and saving the company.My Dad's biggest namedrop.  He met Walt Disney at a work function once.  He was a mechanical engineer.  Shirley Temple giving him the award.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-xJx7KJI2cI'd like to make a DiCaprio joke.. But I can't anymore.shouldn't the big oscar be a girl?Well deserved. Snow White is still a masterpiece of animation techniques and skill.That was the first movie my mother ever saw. We talked about our 'firsts' just this week. 

It would be kinda cool if every Oscar was personalized. It would definitely take away from the tradition and all that but it'd be interesting to seehow come they didn't do this shit for the LoTR movies? You should see the one he got for Song of the South It was, or at least was when I went, on display at the [Walt Disney Family Museum](http://waltdisney.org/) in San Francisco.

They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.

You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.

Fuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.

You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.

    – Banksy 

EDIT1: not really from Banksy but apparently was quoted in a book of his.
EDIT2: Pasting from an 3 years old comment of mine:

This quote is attacking the most evident effect of a system with a great unbalance of power (between big corporations and everyone else).

Advertisement generates a common culture, generates standards, and this is why it's very dangerous, because a big company can enter in the minds of so many people. You say they do advertisement following what people want, I can say they do advertisement trying to tell me what I should want or need. And targeting doesn't make it any better.

The problem is that communication and **creation of culture should be driven by ideas, ideals and emotions,** while now we are in a point in which advertisement is so strong that in the end **culture is produced as a side effect of the communication meant to sell a good**.

This actually can be generalise, because basically any job in a capitalistic consumerist system is responsible or related to exploitation of someone else.

But the critique of this system is necessary.

(*though graffiti can be art)If you're, ""getting mad"" at *any* graffiti... You are wasting valuable energy on nothing. I dont care if its an elaborate piece or chicken scratch... every drop of paint tells a story. If youre going to be an elitist over which types of self expression is ok... youre missing the point. Prople are frustrated, lonely, confused and want to be recognized
 So much so that they would rusk jail to put themselves out there.

If you do it well, people will applaud, but mess up and you're just an ass.that Left Anterior Descending tho...Graffiti makes you mad? Lighten up. I mean if you're a business owner and some 15 year old comes and tags a dick across your storefront, that's one thing. But graffiti on rusted out trains, bridges, underpasses, etc..is art and generally makes those things look better.

We took a caterpillar and put him in a mason jar with holes in the lid. Grass clippings to eat. A few sticks. It was a lush life for Mr. Caterpillar.

Then he spun up a cocoon on one of the little twigs. I had never seen this in real life myself and thought it was so cool. My kids and I were so excited to see Mr. Butterfly.

Time goes by. The grass starts to decompose. So I dumped it out and put fresh grass in it. More time passes. 

I start to worry that I had killed Mr. Caterpillar by messing with the grass and that I was going to have to tell my kids. (They had been checking on him daily and were excited too)

Finally, one day my youngest comes running up to tell me that Mr. Caterpillar had turned into Mr. Butterfly! Yay!

I go to see. And he was brown. It had never occurred to me that Mr. Caterpillar might not in fact be a butterfly. But my boys were still thrilled. We kept him for a day and then we set Mr. Moth free.

5. WIZARD [He was really standing there a while](http://i.imgur.com/YYIFdqo.jpg)I can't even draw a straight line on one of those things...Funny story. I once worked at Ohio Art. My job was to figure out how to sell a million of these that had been sitting in inventory. Outside of the occasional sales bump that would occur when a movie like Toy Story came out, it was hard pushing these things when devices like the Gameboy were flying off the shelves.

My boss asked me to go purchase a Gameboy, play it for a week, and come back and tell her what was so much better about a Gameboy than an etch a sketch. The question itself really answered for me how out of touch she was with what was going on in the world, but seeing an opportunity to play a Gameboy for a week I sprung into action. At the end of the week I explained to her the primary difference between a plastic case full of dust and fishing line, to an electronic modern gaming marvel. She then asked me to research how we could convert our $10 etch a sketch into an electronic gaming system. I took it down to our electronics division and we all had a good laugh. 

And this is why the etch a sketch still just goes up, down and occasionally diagonal if you work at it long enough. 

Funny, they drew a pointilism painting with a tool that can't draw points. Artist is [Jane Labowitch](http://princessetchasketch.com/). Apparently this took eight hours.

edit: Ok I got it. Look at the orange thing in the center of the white ""loop"", thats the Mallards mouth + nostrils facing TOWARDS you. then the little spaces in the bottom are its feet

The swan is facing left, the mallard is facing towards the camera basically.I'm going to disagree with the majority here. It's a wonderful concept but the execution is a little unrefined. The type face of the logo and the restaurant are not the same so it feels disconnected. I think if the designer had instead focused on drawing the animals to create the ampersand, rather than squeezing them in to the sans serif ampersand, it would have better reflected the elegance of the type face in *The Swan & Mallard*.

However, to keep people from jumping ship, they gave you an upgrade card that let you upgrade to first class without trading in any miles or paying any fee if you flew 30,000 miles per year, which I did each year.

Crane must have bounced right offCrane operator here!

After a bit of sleuth work I've found the load charts for the crane in the accident. From the information I've found the crane is a Leibherr LR1300 with 555' of boom. 
https://www.coastcrane.com/docs/default-source/lr1300/lr1300---2316-luffing-jib-capacity-chart.pdf?sfvrsn=2
Looking over the manual, with the configuration this crane was running, it was a limit of 15 mph winds. Reports are there were easily 30mph gusts(probably more between this buildings). 
This is all based on speculation and none of it is a fact, just felt like looking into it. Glad it wasn't worse than what it was!

I lived in NYC for a long time, and this is one of those things that I just never think about.  So many buildings are always under construction, and so many cranes are just sitting above you.

It's terrifying to think about.

Also, awesome picture!-24C is known as Spring here in Northern Canada. Perfect time to break out the shorts!You should be forging steel under the moonlight!I am convinced Sweden is one of the most beautiful places in the world, filled to the brim with beautiful people. All the Swedish ladies I've met so far have been absolute stunners. I love the accent too. Frequently I've considered moving to Sweden from America and while I think I could learn the language without too much difficulty, the challenge of finding a job that pays high enough to maintain the comfortable lifestyle I currently have seems daunting. Then there's all the craziness going on with the refugees. Someday though, someday. Well, this exploded. I have lost control over the comments.

Thank for all your kind words! 

As for camera, i use a Canon EOS 1200D, and on this picture i used an EFS 10-18 lens. 15s shutter F4,5 iso 400. I'm so fucking jealous.

I used to work at a coal fired power plant. The plant had tall stacks that peregrines would nest at every year, which was cool because they were endangered at the time. One day, I'm working on the roof on an AC unit and my coworker and I spot 2 peregrines flying past us. We stop and watch them for a second and we notice that 1 of them has something in his talons (a mouse or something we assumed). Then out of nowhere, right in front of us, the one with the mouse flies upside down, the other one grabs the mouse out of his talons, and then he flips back and they continue on into the distance. Makes me wonder how many people have ever seen something like that.

EDIT: Cool I didn't expect to get so much visibility on this!
Bonus Story: I took a break on the 10th floor and the falcons were nesting above where I was standing. They started gawking and divebombing at me because I guess their nest was nearby.Write a book about it called My Side of the SkyscraperFalcony?Humans can barely afford a walk-up with a shared bathroom in Chicago. How the Hell does a single income falcon afford a one bedroom with a nursery and a view?I like the how Hawks faces is like

""Please don't kick us out sir, the weather is unforgiving""Being able to use skyscrapers as nesting areas is what helped bring back the Peregrine Falcon back from near-extinction.""I made these.""This was the second attempt by the Falcon pair too. They lost all their clutches of eggs two summers ago :(

The apt owner is a cool guy on top of having bad-ass falcons on his porch too. Does a lot of sketch shows and has hosted a few trivia nights at a nearby bar.

Hopefully they'll be back next year"" sooo, is this going to be an issue or something?"" ""excuse me sir these are my fluffs and I'm going to have to ask you to take a few steps back""We have a peregrine falcon family that lives right above us in an apartment in Brooklyn. What I've learned over the past few years:

* The male (I assume) is as bad as a rooster in the mornings and will not shut up.
* They shit constantly. There are times in the summer when we pray for a good rain to clean off our terrace and there are often lovely white streaks down the sides of our windows.
* They are merciless murderers of pigeons.
* They do not like to eat the heads of pigeons. They are happy leaving those as little presents for us to try and keep our dog from eating.
* They will chirp kind of cutely outside a window from time to time.
* People like hearing about the falcon family that lives above you right up until they see a decapitated pigeon right in front of them that we hadn't noticed and cleaned up.
It's not the photographer's balcony, btw. The guy living there let the photographer and the photographer's girlfriend stay with him for a little bit to get the photos though.That is the fastest bird................... in the world.*LET'S GO HAWKS!*>The account caught the eye of Luke Massey as he lounged one night in his camper van near Venray, the Netherlands, scrolling through Instagram after a full day filming beavers.

It's like a dream come true for a dream I never had.That falcon's derp is priceless.Those hawklings are going to be in a real trial by fire situation when they first attempt to take flight... [deleted]""Don't evict me bro, I've got kids""HawkwardSo you know when some baby birds do a little exploring and hop out of the nest as they get older?

That position seems disastrous.I know its not exactly detrimental to the picture, but its not the photographer's apartment.

Growing up near these birds I never thought twice about it.

However, I was surprised to find how many people didn't realize that these birds can fly.

[Here is a video of a peacock in flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Gr_0cHlpM)

I've never seen them fly long distances however I have seen them fly to high trees (30+ feet tall).

I've never seen them directly fly to the top of a 30ft tree, usually they fly to the lower branches and I think they just work their way to the top.  

When I visited the Arcadia, CA arboretum, a worker said there is a peacock that can fly and perch itself up on one of its 60+ foot tall trees.

[Here's a very out of focus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMaO1vhDyrk) but it does show some context of these birds flying out of pretty tall trees.Peacocks are not graceful, my school had them all over the place and it would really be stretching it to call what they do flying.

They flap their wings like a motherfucker, making all kinds of racket, just to get up onto the roof and then when they decide to come down it's like the god damned Hindenburg.  You hear this loud flapping followed by them crashing down and it's all Oh, the humanity.....""

Like a beautiful bull in a china shop.Ah, the majestic disco turkey! Beautiful!

Thanks for sharing!You gotta let me fly!I don't think I've ever seen one in flight before. They're glorious.Pretty sure that's a pokemonIncidentally, it's terrifying to see this coming at you if you don't know what it is.  I used to work at a zoo, and we had free-roaming peacocks everywhere.  One leapt down from its roost and buzzed over the heads of a group of high school girls, doing it's whole ""ee-AWWWW!"" cry thing.  Those girls screamed and ran like hell was on their heels.  It was one of my favorite things I ever saw at that zoo, heh.Such a  nice but rare picture considering they rarely bother to lift that feathery mass off the ground unless they are chasing a small child.

Not that I don't agree with the sentiment expressed here, but it is true that the petrochemical industry is one of the largest sectors of our (Louisiana's) economy, so any big museum, park, etc. will usually have large donations from those companies.That's some slick marketing skills. The Whitest Kids U' Know said it best:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE7KcF3MphU

United Petroleum Rep: ""You know they say that Oil and water don't mix""

United Petroleum Scientist: ""But dammit if we're not trying""

Reminds me of the [insectarium](http://imgur.com/5NqIXkg) at the St. Louis Zoo.[Google's street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.9507235,-90.0632551,3a,37.5y,87.62h,71.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swAEkZd2KUbI-LF6AgfavxA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)By far my favorite moment from visiting the New Orleans aquarium was pranking a little kid.

There was a concave viewing window in the big tank, but head on, you could tell.  There was a little girl sitting head-on but a bit far away.  It seemed she didn't notice that she could poke her head into the concavity to look around.

I went up to the window and said, ""Hey, watch this,"" and placed my hand, mime-style, on where she seemed to think the glass was.  And then *pushed.*

""AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""  And she ran off.

I later saw her frantically pointing at me to who I assumed was her mom as I was leaving.I love how that whole take is supposed to show how those oil rigs provide a great undersea ecosystem.  Fish love Big Oil!They gave us the aquarium so that we dont have to worry about the real ocean anymore. It's also of note that the tank's design and layout are intended to simulate the bottom of an oil rig, so their sponsorship (while certainly eyebrow-raising) DOES sort of make sense.

As a New Orleanian, I know they have the money. I don't like it, but I know it. And I'd rather the kids see it, while the adults roll their eyes at the irony.I thought the same thing when I went there for the first time. 

I always imagined that one day they would put on a kids presentation, showing that there is no way that oil can harm sea life, because water and oil separates. There for, the fist are fine. Or some other BS like that. I was working offshore on a Shell platform when they accidentally pumped 80bbls of Biocide into the Gulf.... ""Oops! My bad...."" 
Reported? = Nope""We're sorry...""The lone survivors.Look at all the fish we kill!they spelled ""destroyed"" wrong I fucking HATED this when I went to NOLA Aquarium.  The entire exhibit is about how the oil rigs provide substrate for coral to grow and create habitat for fish and other marine life.  Yeah I get it that there are fish near oil rigs but not a fucking WORD about the oil spill or cleanup or anything.  Twisted.""Nature - sponsored by corporations"" [deleted]Y'all laugh, but after the oil spill we had a big problem with people marking the BP sign. People would use anything red to cross out that sign: crayons, pencils, markers, sharpies, and most commonly lipstick. After it was all said and done and everything cooled down, AAOA had to buy a new sign. Someone usually stayed by the sign on busier days.

The whole Gulf of Mexico exhibit is geared towards promoting oil companies because to some extent, they actually do help. The right side of the exhibit shows a barren seabed. A few scattered rocks provide minimal cover for small fish, so normally you only see medium to large fish and sharks. On the left side, there's a quarter scale model of an oil rig, which provides hiding spaces for smaller fish which in turn attract even more medium and larger fish. In recent years, reef balls and pipes have been added to show other ways of promoting smaller fish to move in.

Oil rigs, when properly maintained, benefit everyone with perks that are not just about oil. Although making sure you don't spill tons upon tons of oil into the ocean really helps.

Edit: Look, I'm stating this as what they teach their volunteers and how it's presented. This is what they taught me for the years and thousands upon thousands of hours that I worked there and this is the image that AAOA wants to present to the public.

And if you think for one second that I feel that the Horizon disaster was an afterthought, then you have another thing coming. I watched those struggling pelicans with the same sense of hopelessness as I did upon ""the grand pre-open tour"" after Katrina when we basically had nothing alive save for a few animals who could breath air and a couple very stubborn fish. Having gone through nearly a complete aquarium's worth of animals in 2005, if you were there working and if your house had been damaged, you had to develop a very dry sense of humor.

Edit edit: OK, I get it. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was very bad. Y'all act like this didn't effect me, my family, my friends, my workplace, or anything. Please, stop PM'ing me nasty things. Y'all are worse than the lady who thought that penguins were fish and that I couldn't be possibly be right in saying that they were bird and followed me around the rest of the afternoon trying to have a debate to defend her penguin-fish platform.Reminds me of the song Big Yellow Taxi:

*They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum*

*And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them*

*No, no, no*

*Don't it always seem to go*

*That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone*

*They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot*
And that, is, irony!If only we could fit the entire gulf in a tank, just think about all the extra oil we could drill out there in the new desert.Remember when it was sponsored by itself and doing just fine?","{'Sadness': 0.050344, 'Emotional_Range': 0.818, 'Tentative': 0.69, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.318165, 'Analytical': 0.049, 'Conscientiousness': 0.089, 'Agreeableness': 0.595, 'Joy': 0.053192, 'Disgust': 0.192616, 'Extraversion': 0.613, 'Openness': 0.265, 'Anger': 0.934911}",{}

I temp'd at the Boston Beer Company's headquarters in Southie when I lived there for a few years, and this would have been in October of 2014. As the front receptionist, it was my job to sort through those postcards that came from the brewery and make sure nothing vulgar got through. Probably so that the many, many fantastical drawings of penises didn't wind up on places like Reddit and get associated with Sam Adams brand... 

I used to put stickers on dirty messages and still send them through because it made me laugh. Occasionally I even added a note of my own to the postcard if it was really funny. It was a really annoying part of the job because they come in huge bags, but it was also pretty fun because of hilarious messages like this one. 

You'd be surprised how much this occurs. Thanks, dad.

It must be hard to make it your job to tend and care for these creatures, trying to remain objective, thinking of your bottom line and thinking of your animals like goods to be bought, sold, and slaughtered. 

But the fact of the matter remains that . . . you feel an enormous amount of responsibility for these animals. If I knew that a calf had frozen to death slowly over the course of a day and a half, I would feel tremendous guilt. The feelings would be overwhelming. Soup's on!Bad memories... We'd put our animals together and every house will herd them respectively in our village. The herders were always some kids escorted by adults. But someday one of our neighbours decided that he could do on his own. The weather that day was very bad. And it was spring so there was always a chance of some sheep or cow giving birth.

When I returned home from school I saw my mom sitting by a little lamb and crying. The lamb was trying to get up so hard but she couldn't. She was shaking and falling down. She was trying again and again. It was very hard scene. Our fucked up neighbour thought that the weather would'nt heart the lamb if he just picked her up and hold her.

I'd be surprised if the mountain lion actually went for it.A mountain lion snuck up on my tent while I was camping alone in Utah a while ago. Creepiest night of my life by far.

Edit: sometime around 2 am, I was woken up by a low moan that had a slightly aggressive tone to it (the moan lasted about 10 seconds). I grew up near mountains and cows and had never heard anything like that before. 

It freaked me out and I went from dead asleep to pulse racing at maximum just about instantly. I sat up and thought and listened for maybe 10 seconds then I flung open the tent and ran for the truck. I was wearing only underwear and the truck was 50ft away. I made it and rolled down the window a bit to look and listen. 

I had no weapons on me.

Total, I camped out there in the same spot for 3 months and this happened about half way through.

Years later, I listened to mountain lion sounds on YouTube and confirmed that it was a lion. He was maybe 20 to 50 ft from my tent and I think he was kindof asking a question. He was curious and wanted to see what I was. I never saw him and never heard him again.Where was this taken?

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o7mRg74qcY&feature=youtu.be) of this bitch in action.A gif of the little thing 

http://static.businessinsider.com/image/556cd32d69bedd3c21964422/image.gifv>While the device may look like a toy, it’s certainly not priced like one. The PD-100 Black Hornet 2 prices at about $40,000 for larger orders of the device, said Ole Aguirre, VP of business development for Prox Dynamics. But considering that the Pentagon plans to spend approximately $2.9 billion on unmanned systems for the fiscal year of 2016, according to the Drone Center at Bard College, the $40,000 price tag doesn’t seem so significant.

So in other words its a drop in the sieve.russia is ready: http://imgur.com/a83Ewgchttp://imhur.com/a/a1RHO6s.jpgI'm just happy that MiMS found a new job.There's more to that $40,000 package than just the PD-100 Black Hornet 2.  That case hanging off the guys chest houses the display and base station for it.

For what it's worth, it's not a bad little drone.  While it looks low tech it has 3 camera's, has a 2 mile range, can hit 22 mph and has a 25 minute flight time.  Perfect for the types of missions it's designed for, which primarily being spec ops missions, means it's not like they are going to buy so many of these that it dents the nearly $3B unmanned systems budget for next year.

EDIT:  Also worth noting, the British Army has already invested in these, and I believe the Australians have as well.  I also think that the drone itself is cheap and most of the money is in the ruggedized base station and software.  The company advertises the drone itself as ""Affordable - reusable and disposable"" which leads me to believe that replacing the drone itself is probably something more on the order of one of the CICADA systems drones, far cheaper than $40k.Should've waiting for the Black Friday deal. No army deals for Turkey day.This will get buried, but my idiot brother is the one holding the drone in this picture.  When I called him to tell him he made the front page of Reddit and was basically a celebrity, he responded with:  

""...  Cool...  What's Reddit?""Makes me wonder if they have Drones disguised as bugs now that they using to spy on people with. Hence why the Russians supposedly stop talking when they see a fly in the room.If the manufacturer sold more than 50 of them, the price probably would be closer to what we'd expect to pay ourselves. The Noisy Cricket. ""I feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing!""

Edit: Thank you for gilding my first ever comment.Haha... As much as I hate seeing expensive items on my property books that are cheaper in the civilian side... The prices on those items also reflect the entire package of service, maintenance, updates, repairs... As well as contribute to the contractor support when you need a person to come instruct or provide hands on service. 

Ofc this varies between items, but for items sold to the government a lot of the expenses are passed directly into the govt because they will pay it. If a business provides something they need, the govt can always justify the cost of whatever the business says it had (eg it took me 400,000 dollars to make the tools to make this drone, I need to sell it to you for 40,000 to break even or make money on this since you're buying such a limited number of them) You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?Carbon fiber blades, gold plated axis, 4K live streaming camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, 2-40Hz microphone, ultrasound and infrared sensors, stealth absorption paint, facial recognition software with target auto detect and auto follow, satellite communication, radar jammer, micro laser canyon, stun/freeze ray, not to mention that the contractor, designers and builders need to pass FBI background checks and DoD clearance so it all adds up to US$45,392.13 - Bald Eagle Freedom discount of US$5,392.13 = US$40,000.00.

They all buy their market research from the same place.It's ok, you can admit it if you bought an item, or two, or TEN for yourself.Hey man, maybe some of us are new to woman's magazines, and we didn't see that specific magazine over two years ago!Man, my grandmother use to collect a shit load of women's world, I tell ya, they've got some good recipes in there.

Woman's Weekly tells a woman how to knit one.I'm more curious about this Electric Sex. I could use a boostA friend of mine did an internship with Cosmo in college. And she said they had file cabinets full of their old material and would use it for content. She said about 10% of each issue was new content.

Now that I've got your attention...](http://i.imgur.com/0HmhcXd.png)People never seem to get it. These magazines are to women with low self esteem what Archie digests are to children: Recycled good feelings.* Lose weight by doing nothing

* Lose more weight from sex

* Eat everything and never get fatFun fact, despite being founded 24 years earlier, *Shape* has a circulation that's equal to *Women's Health.*Makes sense. Bikini season happens every year. People always want to be in better shape, even if they aren't willing to work for it. The thing that always perplexed me about these ""women's magazines"" (and Woman's World is probably the most guilty of this): Almost every single issue, there are two big things on the cover: ""Make these delicious treats!"" and ""Tricks / Diets to lose weight fast!""

Seriously, take a look the next time you're in the store. 99% of the time you'll find the cover of Woman's World has both of those. It's so absurd.Magazine aimed at single woman: Get skinny fast!  How to get him off!

Magazine aimed at married woman: Bake this incredibly unhealthy cake!  How to lose 20 lbs!
Marketer here.

You aren't their target audience. 

These magazines do TONS of market research or ""testing"" behind the scenes. They interview dozens upon dozens of people behind closed doors and ask them random questions. A lot of the answers given may seem bullshit to us, but market research is about picking up on the ""language"" that your target audience uses today. Hence, you see a difference in the way weight loss is described in the latter version. Same thing, but their target audience now describes their pain points in a different lingo. 

I bet this magazine conducted hundreds of interviews and picked up on pain points, the way their readers think and talk, how they describe situations, etc before they even released this cover.

It's actually SUPER easy to conduct market/customer/user research now. In the past, companies had to do in person interviews and focus groups in order to understand their target audience. That would take WEEKS to organize and conduct... Super slow process and quite frankly, dreadful. Now they go to companies like UserTesting and launch a quick, remote test and within 20 minutes have all the research they need. 

Crazy world we live in!

Aside from the color there are otherwise no differences:

>All eggs start out white in color; those that are laid in shades other than white have pigments deposited on them as the eggs travel through the hen’s oviduct. The journey through the chicken’s oviduct takes approximately 26 hours. The shell takes roughly 20 hours to be complete. Ameraucana birds have the pigment oocyanin deposited on the egg as it travels through the oviduct. This pigment permeates the egg shell resulting in the interior and exterior of the egg being the same blue color. Chickens that lay brown tinted eggs deposit the pigment protoporphyrin on the eggs late in the process of forming the shell. The pigment therefore does not penetrate the interior of the egg, but tints only the surface of the egg, which is why brown eggs are white on the interior. In the case of an Olive Egger, a brown pigment overlays a blue egg shell resulting in a green egg. The darker the brown pigment the more olive color of the resulting egg.Wow, it's a very artistic photograph :DCould you possibly post a picture of each hen showing which egg is hers? That would be cool to see.Banjo Kazooie!hen partyI've seen every single one of those from my mother's hens.

This is going to sound pretty pretentious, but I have been hard pressed to find an emotionally stirring photograph of the Golden Gate since a traumatizing experience I had there last year. I may just have to save this one.

What are we talking- $40 each?  $50 maybe?The sanding...oh god, the sanding...TIL: *Brown Oak is technically not a distinct species of oak, but rather refers to oak (almost always English Oak or another European species) that has been infected with a fungus. This fungus (Fistulina hepatica) has the effect of turning the wood a deep brown color. Once the wood has been cut and dried, the fungus dies, leaving a rich golden brown lumber.*

English Oak (assuming that's what this is) looks to have tighter grain than the Red Oak I'm used to in Virginia.That's awesome.  What's to keep it from drying out and cracking in half 5 years from now?GnarlyThat is a seat fit for an Archdruid[carved from a single piece of wood](http://i.imgur.com/79dvfII.png)Such a perfect stump,

for [Little Rubio!](http://i.imgur.com/dVD7yiu.png)Stunning work of art, it belongs in a museum.  What a gifted craftsman.It's beautiful but somehow repulsive.The craftsman that made this chair was 78 years old. It was the last piece of furniture his boss Tom told him to make. It took him a year and a half to complete.

 As he worked his hands hurt and he felt tired. At times he wanted to cut corners and go home early. But did he? No, he worked harder and more diligently than ever. The sweat boiled from his face as he toiled. Final he was done.

 He showed the chair to his boss the next morning. ""Jim this is the finest work you have ever done."" His boss was very pleased. ""Why did you work on it so hard Jim?""

 ""Because the customer who buys this will live with it for a lifetime."" ""Through good times and bad, through all the seasons and all Hollidays. Memories will be made. Memories maybe I didn't get to make myself."" 

Tom looks at Jim and with a tear in his eye and says ""The chair is yours Jim."" ""The chair is yours Jim....."" ""It didn't take that long, considering I carved all by hand and from a single piece of wood.""That is a lot of work on a very unstable piece of wood. I hope it's kept in a very stable environment.I suppose everyone has different tastes, but this is butt ugly to me.  Tremendous amount of work and considerable skill displayed, but not something I'd have.The sanding...oh god, the sanding...Ron Swanson would be proud... though he could have done that in one evening after drinking a pint of whiskey.TRUMP 2016!!!

Please downvote me!!!Sorry but it reminds me of the nails of the guy who holds the guiness world record for the longest nails.That's glorious!  Thank you for sharing!I was also carved from an oak stump. Excellent showcase of skill.I once made a pinewood derby car.

From a kit.Gorgeous work. Thanks for sharing. I don't know why some are so worried about how big or comfortable it would be. Pretty amazing when you consider it's carved out of one piece of wood.My friend Alex made this! Unbelievably he doesn't have a website, but here's an article about it with some more pics!

Never opened that window in the 10 years I lived there, but small price for having bats for roommates I guess.Cool.  So, she built her nest in between the screen and the window?  How did she get up in there?  Was there a curtain or something up against the window?  It seems like she'd feel kind of exposed...You can see where they keep their nutsThat's really cute! (altough I heard that in some parts of the US squirrels are more pests than cute animals)You should've had him live stream 24/7 the squirrel nest. I would've done it.

I found him barely breathing and the mom dead right next to him. Took me 9 days to find a shelter, lazy but at the same time wanted to see him recuperate before I brought him there. I don't trust paws and other entities like them. 

Edit: tried to leave him in my backyard when he was walking again, no squirrel adopted him but now the squirrels in the neighborhood will come up to my porch and take nuts out of my hand.

Double edit: not necessarily lazy just took me a few days to find a place then get time, took 2 hours to drive there. Also, thanks so much for the gold. Nerve thought that would've happened in my life.

It's odd when you stumble across a place you recognize IRL on reddit. 
I'm friends with your neighbor and have seen that view many times.

 I was wondering who bought that place. Great job on the renovation!Did a girl move in?So is there an Eames chair hiding behind the Eames footrest?That is one amazing maximization of living space. Way to open it up. Looks fantastic.Love the stairs. Where did you get them?

My guess is that your local building code won't accept the open nature of the stairs on one side -- because of the possibility of falls.Some Feeney cable rail would look great on those stairs for the right side handrail. http://www.feeneyinc.com/
Not the cheapest but really nice. I like everything but the new couch. The old one looks so damn comfyWhat's upstairs? It's like...you became an adult. Nice! Do anything professionally or is this from YouTube learning?Went from a cool place to hang out at to a place you have to hold your farts in for long uncomfortable periods of time.Replacing that stair case was money well spent. I feel like the right wall needs to be red or some other accent color. Great renovation.What an incredible transformation! What part do you like best about your new place? Also, what kind of set up do you have? A studio? Or is it something more?Thats a pretty neat carpet design whered you find it?You people are crazy, or all in on a joke or something. 

Dirty carpet, ugly furniture, old ugly kitchen cabinets, cramped kitchen, all fixed and improved. Very good job, OP.I love the new stairs.  It really opened up the space.I'm surprised by how many people prefer the before. The only thing that I would see as a downgrade is the couch. On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't be surprised. Even though I'm only in my early-30s, plenty of Redditors are younger than that. The before reminds me of my first apartment, the second reminds me of what I upgraded into. So well done OP, welcome to adult-hood. Young redditors, you'll be there soon.

* The stairs, way less of a visual strain.
* I'll take hardwood over carpet, every day of the fucking week.
* Opening up the kitchen pass-through into the dining-area is great.
* Using ceiling mounted lighting over the dining area table instead of a floor mounted is great as well. 
* That arcade took up too much space for the area (IMO), good job placing it elsewhere. 
* Many other improvementsLooks great. I like how you swapped out the laminate for some foot friendly carpet. The gaming arcade and well stocked central bar are also nice touches! Very 80's.It is amazing

what throwing out old beer cans

can do for value.Based on the lighting, I'd say there's a window behind where the picture was taken.

It makes those binoculars on the table seem a little bit creepy.I can totally picture myself falling off those stairs... face first.

Colima is like that.  It's rather young (about 5 million years), rather tall (12,595 feet with a 2,000 foot prominence), and highly active (more than 40 eruptions in the last 500 years).  So it's not that difficult to end up getting awesome pictures of it.

There have been five eruptions at Colima in the last 18 months.How do you take an 8 second exposure but not have lots of blur from the moving smoke and possible vibrations in the ground?r/EarthPornDo you want to become my desktop background?

Give me a visualization of gravity sinking in 3-dimensions around the entire object, not just underneath it.As a magnetic applications engineer (actual job title) this post makes me chuckle. Ferrofluid is pretty awesome too, but there's lots of good sim software for visualizing fields in 2d and 3d. There is a nice JavaScript website that lets you put poles and field densities and you can even make halbach arrays and see how they look with no background field or with a global gradient field,...

Edit: pretty sure this is it http://www.falstad.com/vector3dm/ hard to get Java working these days This confuses me. Magnetic lines of flux travel in parallel lines.

Magnetic lines of flux cannot cross.

Magnetic lines of flux exit and enter a magnet at right angles.Wow that magnet is really fucking shit up.Fun fact: the reason that the North part of the arrow on a compass points ""North"" is because this direction is actually Earth's magnetic South pole.

The wheels really spin, too.Toronto has loads of cool street art, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/7qSxzyK.jpg?1) the only decent snapshot I got. If you live in the midwestern or the northeastern US, definitely make the trip. It's not too bad of a hike, relatively inexpensive, & the Parkdale/Ossington area (in particular) is *incredibly* cool. It's like someone rolled up the hippest northside districts in Chicago into one badass neighborhood.

My girlfriend & I went there for Valentine's day last year, completely unfamiliar with the city, & lucked into an Airbnb for $34 a night in the heart of Parkdale.

My boss wanted him reprimanded, but I managed to make it light because... shit, I wish I'd have thought of it.Update: 1 hour later...

My brother is a police officer. Another officer in his dept was bored and decided to do donuts in an icy parking lot in the middle of the night. Of course he didn't want risk anyone seeing a police office doing this so he decided to turn off his lights. After a few minutes of screwing around he smashed into something. He got out and realized he had collided with another officer with the same idea. They were both f*cked and had to confess what they had done.One time a buddy of mine was driving his Grandparents and The widow from a funeral to the reception. Everyone in the car was of course sad as they had just come from the burial of this widows husband. It's snowing so my buddy decides to pull into an empty lot and start doing donuts. Despite being in their eighties, everyone was laughing like they were kids again. Especially the widow. I overheard her thanking him for it later.Llllllike a glovethe day you DONT do this in an empty, freshly snowed parking lot, is the day you've lost your childhood.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62EmEsacEYSeriously, what on Earth did these animals do with their fleeces before we came along? And how did we manage to breed out any ability to deal with it naturally without our help? What would have happened to this sheep if nobody had ever found him, would he have just turned into a giant ball of fleece with a sheep in the middle and eventually died of starvation/suffocation?> The sheep, dubbed Chris, underwent a risky shearing operation to remove 40.45 kilograms of wool. It smashed the previous world record held by a sheep in New Zealand called [Shrek](http://cdn.earthporm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shrek-the-sheep-65.jpg), whose fleece weighed 27 kilograms.

Many times when people click on the comments it's to know what exactly is happening in a picture with no obvious explanation. I feel that as a responsible redditor, I should inform you all because I know the truth since this was in my local newspaper not too long ago. 

What you see in the picture here, happened near the Pakistani city of Karachi. To the west of the city, about 20 miles out, the major highway begins to descend the Al'Bajour mountain. This area is known to frequently experience a very peculiar form of natural whether phenomenon known locally as ""Raheel Sharif"" which transtates literally to ""Wind Falcon"". Well, on this particular day (which was in 2013...thanks for the repost, OP) Raheel Sharif was exceptionally strong in this area of Highway. 

As the photographer who snapped this award winning photograph was about to capture a rare moment when a group of local men nearly caught this wild truck you see here, Raheel Sharif came and actually helped the wild truck become airborne and actually get away. What you see here is the moment before it actually became airborn. What a magnificent beast!Deff read as ""wild duck""

>The bombing of Pearl Harbor surprised even Germany. Although Hitler had made an oral agreement with his Axis partner Japan that Germany would join a war against the United States, he was uncertain as to how the war would be engaged. Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor answered that question. On December 8, Japanese Ambassador Oshima went to German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop to nail the Germans down on a formal declaration of war against America. Von Ribbentrop stalled for time; he knew that Germany was under no obligation to do this under the terms of the Tripartite Pact, which promised help if Japan was attacked, but not if Japan was the aggressor. Von Ribbentrop feared that the addition of another antagonist, the United States, would overwhelm the German war effort.

>But Hitler thought otherwise. He was convinced that the United States would soon beat him to the punch and declare war on Germany. The U.S. Navy was already attacking German U-boats, and Hitler despised Roosevelt for his repeated verbal attacks against his Nazi ideology. He also believed that Japan was much stronger than it was, that once it had defeated the United States, it would turn and help Germany defeat Russia. So at 3:30 p.m. (Berlin time) on December 11, the German charge d’affaires in Washington handed American Secretary of State Cordell Hull a copy of the declaration of war.

>That very same day, Hitler addressed the Reichstag to defend the declaration. The failure of the New Deal, argued Hitler, was the real cause of the war, as President Roosevelt, supported by plutocrats and Jews, attempted to cover up for the collapse of his economic agenda. “First he incites war, then falsifies the causes, then odiously wraps himself in a cloak of Christian hypocrisy and slowly but surely leads mankind to war,” declared Hitler-and the Reichstag leaped to their feet in thunderous applause.

Does anyone have a name and details to go with each person pictured?Dumb me over here looking to see if Abraham Lincoln was in the audience. 

Again, dumb me.Resolution has always been high. It only got low with the advent of digital and reusable/instant cameras. The earliest pictures were just as high resolution as modern professional photos. Analog was inherently better than digital, in the same way that someone performing music live sounded better than a fuzzy record, and then a low bitrate CD, and now MP3s have caught up.I made a scale replica of this exact photo when I was in 6th or 7th grade.  I made the gallows out of wood and sewed up little condemned people to hang from them.  It was a working gallows, too, with a hinge to pivot the trapdoor.  I loved to demonstrate how the condemned would stand there pleading for their lives in their little voices before I heartlessly plunged them to their twisting and kicking deaths.

That was for a school project and I did get an 'A' on it.  I distinctly remember how horrified most of the adults were at how enthusiastic I was about the gallows.  I didn't get why at the time but now as an adult... yeah, that was disturbingly morbid.The woman (Mary Surratt) who is in this picture last words were ""Don't let me fall"".

) of co-conspirator, Lewis Powell.Am I the only one who finds the one guy in the front, who is staring **right at the camera**, creepyI may just be dumb, but I swear that I read that the hangman had to have the exact right length of rope, specific to height and weight of the executed, to avoid either suffocation (rope too short) or decapitation (rope too long). All 4 of the ropes seem to be the same length. Am I missing something?/r/highreshistory is a sub I created for this kind of thing. Historical pictures that look like they might as well have been taken on a modern camera. What's interesting is I knew the second one from his outfit - [Lewis Powell](http://thenewinquiry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lewis-powell-csp11.jpg).  Here he is on the way to the gallows.What is most interesting to me is the attire the conspirators are wearing.  One is a woman so her attire seems pretty standard for the day and age.  The man to her right is wearing a plain shirt and pants.  The two men at the far right are wearing formal suits for their execution.

From the perspective of the executed it almost seems romantic in a twisted way.  Even in death these people fought for something they believed in and were willing to die for something they held as truth.  While no one today would sympathize with them because they are on the 'wrong side of history' as it is often said, people may have very well considered them to be heroes of the confederacy.  Imagine how people today would have felt if they were the assassin's of Jefferson Davis rather than Abraham Lincoln.  Strange considering that is nothing more than a name; Lincoln and Davis were no more men than they were.  Strange considering how history can remember you as a hero or a villain based on nothing more than the outcome of a war.

Not saying any of this is 'correct'.  Just some thoughts I had.This is at Fort McNair, in DC. They hold quarterly open houses where you can go check out the court room where they were tried. The gallows obviously aren't there anymore, but pretty neat to still be able to visit the location.

You don't really ever want to erase or fully cross out any words as they are flowing out of your head because you may want to return to them after temporarily abandoning them. So you end up with this maze-like flow across the page, and only small, insignificant marks identify what's a part of the final version, the real version. Only you know the true path across the page because you are the only one who took that path. It's like driving somewhere once and remembering how to get there the rest of your life.This could also be a prop used in the movie *The Number 23* this is a great look at adderall + mental illness + geniusHe calls it ""stacking""

It was weirdly like watching a kid in Christmas. He couldn't get enough of the crowd and was constantly moving. Eminen's future is not bleak like a lot of people think. I 100% believe in 20 years he will be viewed as like an anti-Bob Dylan.

Her only child died in 1937, she drove her husband out of her house in 1938.  She credits her long life to 3 raw eggs a day.She's been alive for JUST under 1/2 of American history. That's insaneBorn in the 19th century before electricity and phones were available to the common working man. Made famous on social media in the 21st. That's a lifetime.

Edited for historical accuracy.I think she's one of two people left that were born in the 1800's. Crazy that very soon there will be no more people from that century, when only a few years ago there were still plenty around. She lived through the end of the gilded age, WWI, the roaring 20s, the great depression, WWII, the entire cold war, through to the 21st century. It is amazing to consider that she has experienced every major event in the 20th century, and the unbelievable advances in technology.I feel like that every time I see a mirror, and I haven't hit 60 yet!She actually looks really good for 116.  I can't even comprehend how many stories she must have.
She's 16 again.""Ah, when I was a young woman I danced and sang and lived! And my pussy was like fire, yo.""Fuck aging, we need to get onto fixing that shit.I think one of two things would happen if you were that age looking at an image of yourself from so long ago.

1. Ultimate depression, seeing yourself when you were young, and vibrant, and things were still new and exciting, with so much time laid out in front of you.

2. Minimal reaction as the person you're looking at is so long gone you don't really even make a connection. Like looking at infant pictures of yourself.what color isn't she wearing""This is a picture of me taken when I was younger. ""Do people still get horny at this age, or is their libido completely gone?90 years older than me and has more hair. ""What year were you born""?
""1899""
""................wow""I always wondered how people's faces changed so much as they got older.  Now that I am 44, I know exactly how---slowly but surely. Like looking at infant pictures of myself and relish them.Serious question - What is it about extreme aging that makes your face contort? In ever picture of a centenarian I've ever seen, their faces look unrecognizable from when they were younger.Not a very telling facial expression, is it?But is she on metformin?
I can't even comprehend this.  I am not even 30 yet and I consider myself old.  I know I have a whole two year buffer between now and 30, but it doesn't make me feel THAT much better.  

I often think of myself in the present, and back to an important moment in my life and find the midpoint.  I often find myself amazed that 9/11 was closer to 2007 than 2007 is to present.  And then I consider how recent events that happened 10 years ago were.  I graduated high school over 10 years ago now.  And being 28, my life has not even filled three segments of ""10 years"".  

All of these completely irrelevant observations of my life mean absolutely nothing.  I am still progressing through time at the same speed.  It is only my perception of this time that seems to change.  

Whatever, All I know is that 30 years seems like forever, and 80 is 30 years from 50.  I still have 20 years buffer between 50.  And this lady has lived 36 years of long, hard, elderly life AFTER being 80.  

I hope someone else can relate to this. Anybody can look at a pretty girl and see a pretty girl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become. A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl that she used to be. But a great artist-a master-and that is what Auguste Rodin was-can look at an old woman, protray her exactly as she is...and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be...and more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, or even you, see that this lovely young girl is still alive, not old and ugly at all, but simply prisoned inside her ruined body. He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart...no matter what the merciless hours have done to her. Look at her, Ben. Growing old doesn't matter to you and me; we were never meant to be admired-but it does to them.""welp, sure fucked that one up""","{'Sadness': 0.053269, 'Emotional_Range': 0.889, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.186, 'Fear': 0.469129, 'Analytical': 0.026, 'Conscientiousness': 0.086, 'Agreeableness': 0.778, 'Joy': 0.482457, 'Disgust': 0.050056, 'Extraversion': 0.675, 'Openness': 0.106, 'Anger': 0.525207}",{}

Waaaaaay rightLooks like you're sober. Please step out of the vehicle. Sir, I'm sorry but you're not drunk enough to be driving out here. You'll have to chug these three beers before you go.Because god forbid anyone find solace in the bottle whilst driving through that desolate place.Is it true that in Australia you can French kiss your way out of a DUI charge?That's some good police work Lou!That road probably has more traffic then you would think. (could be a main road to a mine or town ect)

Its also very common for people to take there seat belt off and open a can as soon as they hit the dirt roads, the coppers have started to crack down on this.For everyone feeling sorry for the cop, his partner took the photo and theyre taking the piss. My whole family is in emergency services with a cop or two and country policing is worlds away from city policing. Mind you country cops are some of the nicest blokes you'll ever meet. Sir, have you been drinking?

Um, no Officer.

Why not?I'm sure that guy actually lives for the day someone stupidly tries to avoid him so he can break up his day with a little cross country chase. Hell, they might let you off because of it.

*""You know what, mate? That was such a ripper gonna let you off this arvo. Always wanted to see what the ol' ute here could do.""*WTF? Even if you passed out and drove off of the ""road"", what's the worst that could happen? You sleep it off until you run out of gas and end up in the middle of nowhere instead of the middle of nowhere?
I used to work in a factory in the country. Half the blokes lived seventy km away (ie, just around the corner). The company would put on a bit of a social each Friday arvo, buy three slabs of mid strength beer and some packets of chips and the guys would sit out the back and talk shit for a while.

You could tell how far away each bloke lived by how many travellers he took with him. Some of the guys who lived the other side of Echuca needed three cans. 

I mean, you can't blame them, what's the fucking alternative? How else can you get to tea time of a Friday and be on your way to getting drunk if you're stuck in the bloody car for an hour? That's valuable drinking time that shouldn't go to waste!I can just hear the station chief going: ""You either straighten up or I'll have you doing checkpoints in the outback, ya cunt."" That bloke looks like he could use a beer to cool off and pass the time.I would blow past that thing drunk as hell and get into a mad max style high speed car chase in the outback. All shiny and chrome.The test is pretty easy. You fail if you pull behind the police SUV. I was traveling by helicopter in the top end of Western Australia a few years ago. I was looking out the window when I was absolutely blinded by these large hills of reflective material. My first thought was maybe they were mineral deposits or something they were so damn shiny.

When I asked the pilot he told me they were just the empty cans from the Aboriginals living there.""How ya go'n, mate? Been drink'n?""

""No.""

""Well what the fuck's wrong with ya, mate?! There's bloody nothing out here! Good fuck'n thing we set up this fuck'n checkpoint ta hand out booze or you'da had to drive this cunt soba!""

""Yea right. Thanks officer.""

""Just do'n ma job, mate. Now fly tha fuck off.""I wonder who's daughter that guy fucked?I grew up in the country.....real country in Western Australia.  I went to school with 6 kids in my class.  Anyway back then we actually had a cop in the town and his job was also to look after the other smaller town about 40km away.  ( Now there is no cop in the town as now all small country towns must have two police or none ) 

Anyway he used to walk in to the pub and say.. Ive got a booze bus on tonight.

He would setup right opposite the police station.  Anyone that drunk that drove past the police station on the way home was asking for it.  

Same cop used to cut off the sleeves of his cop shirt.. Now this is a big issues as the uniform is owned by the Govt not the cop.  He couldnt give two shits

He also used to walk into the pub and tell some of the guys they were two drunk to drive home to their farms........ so he would hand the keys to the kids.  My mate ( 12-13 at the time) used to drive his dad home all the time. probably 25-30km home.   Now most farm kids have been driving since 8-9 with their own farm buggies (Beach Buggies - Usually VW engine on a welded together frame ).  

this was back in 1980's
where's the esky and umbrella?
Funny thing is I've driven down a back road kind of near there (100km-ish close), as it was totally a shortcut (ok it wasn't but it was still fun).

Only thing I saw was sheep.  No cops.  Drove 150km and I dont think I saw another car, which isn't really that weird.

**Ichdryss' Frozen Heart**


*Artifact (requires attunement), very rare*

The dead Cryomancer Lich's still beating heart, encased in everlasting cold. While attuned to it, you can use an action once a day to command it. You must make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful, you control the heart for an hour and can now cast 5 extra spells. These spells are:


    frostbite (cantrip)
    gust (cantrip)
    ray of frost (cantrip)
    thaumaturgy (cantrip)
    fog cloud (level 1)
    ice knife (level 1)

On a failed check, you are charmed by the frozen heart while you remain attuned to it or until it is destroyed.

The politicians holding this back specifically are Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

Edit: Full list of all Members of Congress & their support is [HERE](http://renew911health.org)If there were more people like Jon Stewart in the world I'd be less concerned about my kids' futures. If he was handing out checks they wouldn't ask him to leave. We need more lobbyists like him.This man is genuine, always have been and always will, much respect. Still fighting the good fight. Ain't the same without ya, Stew Beef!Those first responders gave up there health and in many cases now their life to save people on 9/11 I don't understand why this is even an issue. Give them whatever medical treatment they need, they are hero's and they have earned it. The people holding this back are monsters and we should be ashamed to call them Americans. Apparently ""Never Forget"" only applies to who did this to us, and not the brave men and women of the NJ/NY Police, fire, transit departments who tried to save as many lives as possible.

It's fucking disgusting.I'm a cold war vet, Republican. Had the whole bee hive mentality forever. Until Iraq, when they didn't find the weapons of mass destruction, I went to the dark side. Became a liberal, hate politicians with a passion. Doesn't surprise me that McConnell and or Ryan use the 911 first responders health benefits to get what they want. They're all pieces of shit, starting with Reagan.This wouldn't be such a big problem if we simply decided that healthcare as a right, for everyone, was both necessary and prudent.  Then we wouldn't need a bill for special healthcare for those who sacrificed the most on 9/11.  It seems to me that we pay an arm and a leg through private insurance, get less coverage, less people covered, and pay more than is necessary for healthcare.  The simple fix is overhauling the current system and actually acting like were our ""brothers keeper"", versus this nonsense that we keep having.  People seem to think such evil of the government at all times that they forget the evil of insurance companies. Let alone those who aren't lucky/hardworking enough to afford private insurance/deductibles/etc.  Mr. Stewart, you haven't paid the right people for us to allow you to lobby Congress.I've always been on the fence about Jon Stewart but high profile people standing for what is truly right is what we need.Did Jon Stewart get more badass when he quit the Daily Show? He looks like some kind of Jewish Politico Wolverine!

edit; A letter.Sorry to any passionate Jon Stewart fans, i'm English i don't actually know what this man did, and why he is so big, little summary anyone?They should be protecting him.  He is the most important Jew.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVDKQOfDKagSomeone is making good use of their retirement, Stewart for pres!
He gets it. He gets life. I love JSHe is so passionate about this issue as he should be. I would love to see him come on to Stephen Colbert's show and just blast the people holding the bill hostage. That would force it through real quick Heart crushing picture. 

You have to wonder how many of those cops would run in to a flaming congress at this point. The appropriation is fully funded until next November and the votes are there the only thing being haggled about is a five year authorization or a lifetime authorization which would include medical benefits for the Beirut Marines and two or three other terror victim groups ... Dems blocked the vote in committee so the committee chair tabled it until it could be brought back to a vote to authorize with the additional benefits. 

TL;DR: For Fucks Sake the deadline is next year and the debate is about more benefits or equal ...Man he is looking haggard.At times Stewart is too liberal for me but the fact that we aren't supporting these people is an embarrassment to our nation. As a citizen I have absolutely zero qualms funding this and I'd be hard pressed to finding someone who does. We waste money on so many areas and here is one of the spots where people draw the line?meanwhile U.S Capitol Police tweet and update Facebook that they saw Jon Stewart while working todayWe love you Jon.One does not simply tell Jon Stewart to leave.There is our fantastic government at work, fucking over those who risked it all.

It's strange seeing the place you grew up referenced on Reddit. It's nearly always quaint old shit or cheese rolling.As I drive around America I am occasionally saddened by the realization that virtually none of the modern buildings we currently construct will be around for future generations to admire. ""We don't build em like they used to"" is quite an accurate sentiment.Related. Last year I had the pleasure of visiting [Puzzlewood](http://www.puzzlewood.net/) in the Forest of Dean which is said to have been Tolkien's inspiration for the forests of Middle Earth.

LPT: Dig through people's recycling when Chipotle mails out coupons for extra coupons

TIFU: By eating too much Chipotle and getting E. ColiBack when I worked for them (wow, 14 years ago), we'd hand out free burrito coupons like they were mints.  I always had a stack of 50 or so in my car.  I'd leave them with tips at sit down restaurants (always left 15% or more + coupon), with gas station attendants, at preschool/school, where ever I could.

Also, on Wednesdays, I got to go give away surprise burritos.  I'd get to make up 20 or so, and take them to a local business (or businesses, if it was a small one) and deliver them a surprise lunch.      I loved doing the marketing for Chipotle.   As long as it generated sales, my district director was cool with whatever we did!    How does one go about getting on the mailing list for these?This is great. I got these mailers, too. Plan to raid the recycling bin later tonight. No shame. 

I got the free burrito text thing back on the 20th. Went to redeem it and their computer scanner was down so they just let me have it for free without using my coupon. Went back the next week and used the coupon. I'm never buying Chipotle again, I'm just gonna milk this cow till it collapses.I can't believe so many people threw them awayChipotle doesn't send me shit.

I thought it was a gimmick myself, until I realized as I read the card that it had no limits on cards per person nor where the card could be used nor any registration requirements.  All I had to do was phone in the card to activate it and I had $5 at any Walmart.

I immediately returned to the trash can next to the mailboxes and promptly dug up another $45 for a fifteen minutes of work.  I then hit the street, hitting the trashcans next to the mailboxes at all the other apartment complexes as well.  I ended up with $200 in cards, which made for a rather nice ""Surprise"" once I took them to Walmart and exchanged them for a single card.

It pays to pay attention to the junk mail!I'll send chubby nudes for free burritos.The fact that all of these are in perfect condition though you claim they were tossed in the bin makes me think this is an inside job.

However, if you take and hang each individual dog tag people can get a sense of how many unique lives were lost to such an unnecessary cause. 

This trend of being offended needs to stop, people need to stop looking for reason to be offended and instead look for reasons to celebrate or appreciate.

Edit: Initially when I wrote this reply posts in this thread were uncertain how to feel. I suppose I went off topic slightly but I wanted to get my interpretation across. All I want to do is run my hand underneath and watch them all sway back and forth....Where is this at? As a veteran, I would love to see something like this. Brought to you by Boeing and Lockheed MartinI think this is really cool. That is all I have come to say. Now picture 3 of those and that is how many Vietnamese lost their lives.I feel like I've seen this. Where is the installation?Looked like a fancy chandelier at first.I imagine they might have put names on those tags (one would hope), but they're not real tags - if anybody was wondering.That's a lot of steel.Does a breeze ever hit them and cause them to chime? I can only assume the sound would be haunting. Any larger resolution with less JPEG?Man... I read this as Vietnamese dog tag (from their collar) memorial...Are those real dog tags? If so that is amazing and is a very powerful representation of how many died in the Vietnam War. I remember visiting the Nerman Art Museum near Kansas City and seeing [the robe of dogtags](http://imgur.com/gallery/cqDLf) there. The dog tags used in this sculpture were not actual tags though.So does anyone else besides me just want to run their hands through that?I read that as ""Vietnam dog memorial in Chicago"" and got very confused as it looked like it had nothing to do with dogs.This should be in the break room at the pentagon.So, I've been in Vietnam. To me it seems some people are really proud they won agains the USA. Others are more abivalent. Nevertheless, this country is as communist as China - so not at all. In the end all soldiers fo both sides died for nothing.

That slab looks surprisingly and beautifully intact for having been underwater for 1000 years.This is from [Thonis-Heracleion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleion) (the Egyptian and Greek names of the city), an ancient Egyptian city near Alexandria whose ruins are located in Abu Qir Bay, currently 2.5 km off the coast, under 10 m (30 ft) of water. Its legendary beginnings go back to as early as the 12th century BC, and it is mentioned by ancient Greek historians. Its importance grew especially during the waning days of the Pharaohs—the late period, when it was Egypt's main port for international trade and collection of taxes.

According to [here](http://www.franckgoddio.org/projects/sunken-civilizations/heracleion.html), OP's picture is of:

> The stele of Thonis-Heracleion (1.90 m), ordered by Pharaoh Nectanebo I (378-362 BC), is almost identical to the stele of Naukratis in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo. The text of the stele mentions the site where it was erected: Thonis. 
©Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation, photo: Christoph Gerigk 

[The stele's purpose was to use a portion-(10 percent) of the water-way use tax, (import tax) for the services of the priests in charge of the temples of the goddess Neith.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_steles_of_Decree_of_Nectanebo_I)

Bobcat.Just gotta throw this out there. About 5 months ago my mom got attacked by a bobcat while her and her husband were walking their dog... on an island... that didn't have bobcats. 

They came across the thing and expected it to run off, but instead in charged and pounced on her, mauling her back. The dog went ape-shit, her husband grabbed a nearby branch and beat the thing until it finally let go and ran off. 

My mom, being a bit of a gangster, just wanted to go home and have a drink. 

Luckily, her husband isn't very gangster. His name is Douglas after all. He insisted that they go and get her some rabies shots. Which was a bit of an ordeal because they had to leave the island. 

The Ranger went back with them, hunted the bobcat down and killed it. Turns out it was rabid. 

They think someone must have taken it out to the island and dumped it there, since it'd be impossible for a rabid animal to swim to the island (it's a small camping island and rabies causes hydrophobia). 

Was a big sucker, too.

The south facing sides of these sculptures would be melted more than the north (hence north facing ski faces always last longer). The melted sides are to the left, so the south is to the left, meaning you are facing almost dead west. I'm drunk Sherlock so all of that might be wrong. I can see it in your local news,

Fuck I'm bored.

So obviously he high-tailed it out of there, but could never find his way out of his nightmarish lack of a brain. And so owls made of snow, fall in the asphalt, eventually..

I took the monitor in my hands and looked at the screen. My son was fast asleep so I was a little confused as to where the noise was coming from. Couple of seconds later, my bedroom door bursts open and my son is standing right there. I look down and see my son still sleeping through the baby monitor. I got quite the scare and only calmed down after I realized the monitor froze and was no longer giving me a live feed. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that my son didn't stay standing by the door once he opened it. As I was looking at the monitor and realizing it's still a picture of my son sleeping in his bed, my son at the doorway started to briskly walk towards me. It's in the middle of the night so all I can make out is his silhouette. The moment the door opened part of my brain told me it's my real son. But the other part tells me that it couldn't be because the real one is asleep in his bed. Luckily, the one approaching me spoke to me and it snapped me out of shock and I automatically dismiss the monitor version. I check the monitor again and confirmed it's malfunctioning. Thank the gods I snapped out of shock because it would be pretty tough explaining to the ER doctors why I had dropped kicked my own son in the face in the middle of the night. http://i.imgur.com/gBxhEcZ.png

What you are seeing here is a standard portrait of demonic manifestation, nothing to worry about. just turn on the lights. Sensitive eyes can see a red glow coming from the IR emitters in the camera. It is impossible to see but in extremely dark rooms where your eyes can adjust to the low light. Your child is likely staring at the brightest thing in the room... the eye that is looking at her  -your camera. Surce - I can see the IR emitters in my child's bedroom.

I work at FedEx, and this is what it looks like from inside the cab of a deicer. Sooo um how do they know when they're done?That stuff is stupid expensive. I'm not sure how many gallons it took, but I know my small cargo plane would take about 300 gallons at $9/gallon, depending on the type of De ice fluid, and that was 10 years ago.

* The US still has an active military base within the crater (some parts off limits to the public)

My natural instinct was to duck and cover my head from shrapnel. “Shit!” I yelled, but as soon as I looked up, I was met with Jan’s calm gaze. “It’s okay,” he said. “Let’s just prepare all your stuff in case we have to leave quickly.” Before Jan even finished his sentence, the fighters had already grabbed their Kalishnakov rifles and ran for the trucks parked outside the base. Jan explained that those fighters will go out to support those on the frontline and be prepared to drive any wounded back to the base.

It's cheaper than the bloody cinema for fucks sake! It really is fantastically affordable for when you're really poor because you live in London.Is this at ""The Globe""?Rain is actually pretty minor to stage actors. I knew a girl in high school that had to get dragged across stage while ""unconcious"" at one point during the show, and it just so happened the stage crew were some sloppy motherfuckers who left some screws lying around. 

She ended up with one of them driven about an inch deep into her leg. Didn't react at all, and later got up and delivered her monologue while steathily pulling it back out. Got backstage a few minutes later looking like she was going to murder the whole crew.This is the production of Henry V from summer of 2012.

2012 being the year that even Londoners thought it was unusually wet.Several years ago my family went to the Oregon Shakespearian Festival to watch a performance of A Comedy of Errors.  It was in an outdoor theater like this one and it rained, which led to one tiny ad-lib by the Dromio of Syracuse, in the scene where he's describing Nell the kitchen wench to Antipholus:

>Antipholus of Syracuse: What complexion is she of?

>Dromio of Syracuse: Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept.  For why: she sweats.  A man may go overshoes in the grime of it!

>A.S.: That's a fault water will mend.

>D.S.: No, sir, 'tis in grain; *even El Niño could not do it.*We have a replica of the globe theatre in our city and our theatre thought about a deployable roof for when it starts to rain.

Security carried her out.  Saw her later outside, bandaged up.  The entire troupe was there making sure she was OK.  Dedication AND devotion.When you have to act through the costume AND the weather, AND an uncomfortably close audience;this woman deserves a massive round of applause.I saw ""Twelfth Night"" at The Globe in 2002. Stood right up by the stage. Bought a poncho at the gift shop as it looked like rain. It didn't rain like it is in your picture but we were still glad we had them as one of the actors had a tendency to spit his lines.&nbsp;

Truly magical.If I remember correctly, this is the theater where they had done a Shakespeare play in its original ""accent"" I thought cameras weren't allowed in the Globe?That performer is a woman. Scandalous!Globe in london is great (if you're seated just make sure you're not behind a pillar and the cushions are worth buying). They had scented fires burning for titus andronicus when i last went, great atmos.


[they have a media player online for their plays](https://globeplayer.tv/)Did you dip your balls in the rainwater?Thanks, /u/DIP_MY_BALLS_IN_ITI was at a show in The Globe while it was pouring once. Still the best live show I've ever been to.I saw Midsummer there. I was stood in the pit, in the rain, on crutches. Still one of the best theatre experiences I've ever had. Ah, the good ol' Globe Theatre. 

In 2003, I saw Richard II and Richard III back to back there. The Richard II cast was all male, and the Richard III cast was all female. Some of the best theatre that I've ever seen in my entire life. And as a groundling, you do get to be part of the show on occasion. We were watching RII, and I was watching from the lip of the stage apron. 

Mowbray then called for a favour to pledge his oath to Richard II... from the audience. Now usually, I'm guessing someone gave him a scarf, or hat, or glove, maybe even something as weird as their glasses, or jacket, but no one was giving him anything, and it was almost holding up the show. He then got to me, and almost desparately yelled in my face for a favour with which to pledge his oath, and not wanting a fellow actor to continue dying on stage, I reached into my pocket and gave him the first thing I found: ***my wallet.***

He took it, glad to finally have a prop and continue the scene, and then he realized what I'd given him, then did a double take to me, and realizing he could play the audience with it, did a take to the audience with the facial expression of, ""This bloke just seriously gave me his wallet..."".

Only after I'd done it did I realize exactly the ramifications of that act: I was in a foreign country, and now had no ID, no Debit Cards, No Tube Pass, and no Cash. I looked horrified, but the actor playing Mowbray winked at me, I'm guessing to let me know it'd all be alright.

The serious duel scene of Act I, Scene III really took on a more humorous air simply with the addition of my wallet, with the picture sleeves flopping all over the stage, and me worrying that my pound notes would fly into Henry IV's face.

After the scene finished, I expected that they'd return my wallet and *exeunt*... but they left the stage. 


With my wallet.


I was absolutely mortified.


By the time Intermission rolled around a half hour later, I was determined to get my wallet back and looking for an employee to go back stage and retrieve it, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was the Stage Manager (headset and all), and she handed me the wallet, and then its contents in a large clear sandwich bag. She apologized for the actors leaving the stage with the wallet, but since it usually wasn't an expensive item when the favour is given in that scene, leaving the stage as they had rehearsed it was something that added to the humor of the audience participation. She apologized profusely, whilst I apologized on my behalf for putting the actor in that position as I knew he was dying on stage and I wasn't thinking when all I wanted to do was help. We had a nice laugh, and I thanked her then exited to go to get some intermission snacks.

As I was rebuilding my wallet, I found something in the bag that wasn't initially in my wallet, as it was far too large. It was a folded piece of paper, and I couldn't imagine what it was.

As I unfolded it, I was surprised, as it was a small poster for the show with all the actor's signatures on it thanking me for being a part of the show and left a space for me to sign my name above where they'd written ""groundling"". The signature from Mowbray was the best, his had ""Gimme your wallet!"" written above his signature.

All around a great experience, wonderful theatre, and a fantastic anecdote.I read this to the tone of Queen ""The Show Must Go On"".

Unreal. ""This may smell bad, kid, but it'll keep you warm until I get the shelter up."" - *Han Solo*

Dog's going to feel great with all that off.The labradoodle, having grown too large for its skin, sheds the outermost layer along with its fur coat. This is normally done only in the warmer months because if they are unable to regrow enough fur to stay warm during a cold snap they may freeze.Corollary: brush your dog with the right kind of brush.  A coat like this needs a rake comb and a slicker brush. 

I used to groom and I had a few clients swear up and down that they groomed their dogs daily but the coat would still look like this... Then I found out they used those stupid rubber bristle brushes and they were just brushing through the top layer of the coat, not getting down to the tangles. After brushing our dogs, my mom would leave the fur in a pile in the corner of the yard. It would all be gone in a few days, because the birds loved to use it for their nests.Yeah, we have this problem with our Labradoodle. 

They are lovely dog, great looking and brilliant temperament, but dear lord do their coats need a lot of maintenance. We have to have our doodles coat specially washed, cut and brushed every few weeks, or it gets into a horrific tangle and matted mess. It's not fair to the dog, and also looks terrible.

Their coats also are magnets for twigs, leaves and seeds. Snow is also an issue, clogging up and latching onto their fur on the legs. Labradoodles are great dogs, but it's important to keep their coat short, or meticulously well maintained. Groomer here- what you don't see is that if those matts have been there a long time, especially around the legs, ears and tail, they cut off circulation to the surrounding skin because the matts pull so hard. When you shave it off, the blood rushes back and can burst small blood vessels. Long story short heavily matted dogs can get hemotomas in their ears that can burst, and light to severe bruising on their bodies depending on the severity of the matting. 
Moral of the story- brush your fucking dogs i dont understand what I am looking at?Oddly it reminds me of the surgery scene in Independence Day. Real talk:

Letting your dog get this matted can be dangerous. Skin with little contact with the air can develop sores and matts can even cut off blood supply to some parts of their body in extreme cases. Matting can be a serious health issue for dogs, especially if these sores become infected.

Don't let this happen to your dog. Dogs (especially ones with hair like this one) should have a cut as often as 4-6 weeks in addition to daily brushing. As quickly as 8-10 weeks the coat can become unmanageable and the dog will have to be shaved.

For more info [here is a link on matting](http://www.dogdayafternoonspa.com/groomingservices/aboutmatting.html)This makes me immensely uncomfortable /r/oddlysatisfyingIt's not just a matter of brushing/combing, but using appropriate tools to brush down to the skin and detangle the fur without damaging or cutting the fur. For example on my Siberian huskies I mainly use an [undercoat rake](http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-W6110-Grooming-Undercoat-Rotating/dp/B0002DIRYG). Gently detangles the coat without cutting or damaging. On our toy poodle I use a [metal comb](http://www.amazon.com/Coastal-Pet-W556-Safari%C2%AE-Medium/dp/B0002AQUPM), and when his fur is longer I then finish with a [slicker](https://www.petedge.com/zpetedgemain/catalog/productDetail.jsf?wec-appid=PEDM_WEBSHOP_TR&itemKey=005056A633791ED2B586429949F84FB3) very gently so it doesn't scratch and irritate his skin. What you never want to use is a Furminator deshedding tool or similar things that are blades on a handle. Cuts and damages. I've seen the Furminator deshedding tool used to cut the scraggly hairs on terriers instead of hand stripping.My SO and I are groomers and we see and deal with stuff like this almost daily.[NSFW-ish](http://i.imgur.com/HBlcItS.jpg)I am sorry for asking a stupid question but what exactly happened and why do most people say it makes the uncomfortable?This happens with all kinds of dogs, TBH. I was once at my groomers waiting to pick up my corgs when some lady came in super blustering about how their fairly large dog (p. sure it was a bernese or great pyrenees, my memory is foggy. but one of those types of dogs.) who had matted fur all along its backside and back legs, preventing it from going to the bathroom effectively. 

It was around closing time for the groomers and they kept trying to explain to this lady that a simple brushout was NOT going to work for that amount of matting and she'd have to come back tomorrow because an effective groom was going to take hours. The lady was PISSED. 

If you have a dog, you need to be prepared to care for it. Regular grooming is part of said care requirements for a large amount of dog breeds. And I know it sucks, but you gotta be prepared to get down and dirty to take care of your dog's coat in between grooming sessions. Do I dislike having to clean poop out of my corgi's buttfloof? Absolutely. But I do it because they're my responsibility.It's a dog snuggie. You all won't be laughing when he can sit on the couch *and* read a book without getting cold arms. Why should I when they unzip like that?I'd feel a lot better if there was a zipper on there.http://imgur.com/nwisHG3 This doodle came into our shop a few days ago.

What a time to be alive. >In February, 2002, on the recommendation of local shopkeepers, Zubaida’s father, Muhammad, sought help from the Americans for his severely burned daughter.

I feel a sense of pride in that sentence.I saw the documentary about her on TLC a few years ago. All about how an American nurse discovered her and heard her story about how a kerosene lamp exploded all over her in her family's hut and the people of the village shunned her saying she was cursed. She was brought to the USA and doctors volunteered their services to restore her face and neck. I believe it was called ""A Face for Yulci"". A real tear jerker. Someone less lazy than I am might find it on YouTube. I can think of few things that would be more rewarding that being the Dr who performed the surgery.  This is life-altering work he/she is doing, and would be far more fulfilling than doing tummy-tucks and nose-jobs.  

**EDIT**:  For those who think I am disparaging the other work surgeons do, or the skills involved, I'm sorry to inform you that was never my intent, but feel free to continue buying pitchforks.  Please pay attention to the words I used:  

* **I can think of few things that would be MORE rewarding** -> That means other work can be rewarding as well, but in my opinion, this would be MORE rewarding.  This is underscored when I said **would be far more fulfilling than**, implying that there is still fulfillment to be found doing other types of work.  

* I wish I was surprised, but reading the words **This is life-altering work he/she is doing, and would be far more fulfilling than doing tummy-tucks and nose-jobs.** and using that to get to: 

>  there's no need to disparage people who get tummy tucks and nose jokes 

is how you chose to interpret this.  That's like reading ""Warm weather is great"" and thinking I am calling everyone who lives in cold climates fools.  If you want to make leaps of logic like that, feeling free to make another flying leap...  

* For anyone thinking I am questioning the skill level involved, far from it.  Most schools require an undergraduate degree to be accepted for Medical school, and after basic medical school, there are the specialization requirements.  11 to 15 years is not unheard of (source: family member accepted for Surgeon's program).  

* Lastly, I still expect further criticism because it wouldn't be Reddit otherwise.why the long face? ^^I ^^hate ^^myself.That is some pretty top notch plastic surgery, oh my.That's why you let the hot pocket cool down.. 

But in all seriousness, if this is real, it's fantastic work. That said, Tumblr as sauce.. Why is this so good? Whenever you see a similar surgery the persons face looks like a bloated jigsaw puzzle. They never look as good as her. Whats the magic?That is excellent, **excellent** work.  I hope the patient recovers and has a good life.I'll just leave [This](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/xxBbgdQ) here. I believe this type of operation should be considered a human right.  My views tend to be conservative  but I am very happy to see poverty as a whole decreasing at a rapid rate in the world.  If we stopped fighting each other we could collectively provide food, medical care, clean water and education for everyone.  We could also clean up the planet pretty damn quick.  People should be entitled to their success while still providing compassionate care to those in need without access.  She looks beautiful.  Holy hell. What a relief that must be.Ok serious question.

I have similar windows right next to my desk, every day a female cardinal lands on the window sill and looks at herself for several minutes, sometimes pecking at her image.  Usually the male eventually sees her and starts singing at her until she turns and they fly off.   I always imagine him yelling ""C'mon, you look fine!, We have to go, we're going to be late!""
We never got deer, but we definitely got a lot of people stopping to fix their hair, a few fixing makeup and one muscly asian guy who danced while staring at himself for about five minutes.

Probably the best and cruelest use of it was gluing a coin to the pavement.They suck when geese or swans nest by them, the dumb things see their reflections and think that it's a rival, and peck at the windows.

Every morning we would wake up to a family of quails banging their heads against the window, I assume to beat up the other, identical family of quails who were invading their turf.

Quails are not so smart.[deleted]I worked in my university's print shop full-time, sweet deal, free tuition and they let me leave for three hours each day, with pay, to attend one class plus I was on campus for the evening class as well.  Anyway, our print shop was mostly underground but had these windows where you could look up to the sidewalk.  There was a railing just above and a lot of students would lean on the railing.  I had six student aides working for me and Jesus Christ did they ever stare up the skirts through that window all damn day.  I never did because I'm just not that type of guy.  I ended up taping cardboard over the windows between semesters so the next batch of aides didn't know any better, but sure enough those guys had already heard about the perk and tore down my cardboard.Expected two hobos fucking.  Was pleasantly surprised.Its great until someone stores their dildo against the window.That ain't no deer I ever seen. Where is this?

EDIT: First video taken down, [here is the video i was talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbvZNy7Bmw)I worry more about airborne debris than I do about a pressure wave.    My dad was a maintenance foreman at a refinery for many years.  They had just got on site when a grain elevator about 3/4 mile away exploded.  Not your normal little sheet metal silo, but a huge concrete structure on the ship channel.  They saw it go and could feel the heat on their skin.  One of dad's crew yelled ""Take cover!"" and they scuttled behind the cracking tower they were going to work on that day.  Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet.How deep does it go?So does anyone know why caused that massive explosion? Knowing my luck, i bet those tar filters i ordered from China last week were in one of those shipping containers.Only 50 people died? How many were vaporized?is there a before picture?That was the largest explosion I've seen that isn't a nuke.  I don't even think a MOAB is that big.To give you another unbelievable indication of the explosions scale, here is a ""before"" picture of the exact area affected from Google Earth.  The red circle is the now water-filled crater, the yellow is the area substantially destroyed by the blast.

It kind of looks like the crater is filled with water --does anyone know? It's difficult to see the depth of the crater.Thank God the explosion happened in that giant craterIs that how it's going to be remembered from now on?  The Tianjin Crater.  Just level the ground around it and abandon the land or turn it into a park of something.  

I lived close by to a massive explosion that happened in Quebec.  [The McMasterville Explosion 1975](http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/faits_divers/clips/12049/).  That too made a huge crater in the ground and levelled an entire factory complex that belonged to CIL.  The remaining factory was demolished and scrapped.  [You can see for yourself the land has been abandoned to this very day.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/McMasterville,+QC/@45.5403273,-73.2314636,720m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cc9aa8c356f3055:0xadd1c7a969a383e4!6m1!1e1)  It's not a farm, the land is too saturated with chemical toxins.  It's not a dump because the toxins make it too dangerous to work in.  It's just fenced off abandoned land.    This is a [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=3&lat=39.0413061&lng=117.7360516&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&rem=&zm=15) to the ever-useful ""NukeMap"" website that shows the estimated crater and fireball size for a 3kT blast at the site.

Edit:  Here is a third [link](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=0.02&lat=39.0388145&lng=117.7362823&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&crater=1&casualties=1&humanitarian=1&rem=&zm=18), this time with a blast setting of 0.02kT, which I am being told is the more accurate value than the 3kT value that I grabbed from earlier in this thread.   (NukeMap uses google API, so you can switch to satellelite view and drag the point of impact around to compare.)It really does look like the aftermath of some type of nuclear fallout. Scary stuff.from Wikipedia:

>Chinese state media reported that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics,[5] a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.[3]

 

>The first to respond to the fire were unable to keep it from spreading. The Global Times reported that firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water, as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in chain more violent chemical reactions.

We got on the train, and all fell asleep pretty quickly. I was first to wake up and I was quick to notice that although we were still moving, it was very slow and dark. I looked out the window and down the train, and to my amazement the fucking train was being put into a big cruise ship. I quickly nudged my buddies awake, and as any engineering major would do, they all instantly sprung an infrastructure boner. We were flabbergasted. Our train is going into a boat this is insane. Just when we thought it couldn't possibly get any cooler, they let everyone out of the train to walk around the ship, grab a bite to eat, have a cigarette and stretch your legs. The best part though, was hitting the duty free shop and getting a bunch of booze for the rest of the trip. I don't know if that's a normal mode of transportation in Europe or even in the U.S. but it was the first time I had seen it and I was blown away.In addition to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel already described, the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel also has the same configuration.  Here's a picture of it [EDIT: actually, with thanks to /u/chasetwisters for the clarification, a picture of its next-door neighbor bridge-tunnel the MMBT, see below for the real image].

""Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridge–tunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels.""

So, if you like these, and you live in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area, you have your choice of two [EDIT: or, really, three] bridge-tunnels.

**Photo Details:**

This photo is a 26.6 MP photo  merged from two 24 MP shots from a Sony a7 camera. I had a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.4 manual focus lens (with a B+W filter for protection) attached. The two shots were merged using Lightroom's built in photomerge (which results in a single raw pano). Not much was done in Lightroom other than exposure changes, color changes and some healing brush to remove lens flare.

This photo was taken after I shot a 3 hour timelapse of the sunrise. I was just about leave, when I decided to actually take a few photos.

I've only built one brick/stone wall, but when we did it we started at the bottom.> Just as individual blocks were prepared, so too were the adjoining stones already set in the wall.  In order to receive a new block, bedding planes were carved into those stones below or to the side of the block to be added. This is how the Twelve-Angled Stone took on its busy upper outline; the upper portions of the block were recarved several times over as five blocks — set in a left to right sequence — were fitted along the course above.

> Other blocks in the wall were similarly shaped, then reshaped as new blocks were added to the masonry mass. As stones of irregular size and degree of finish were inserted into the mural fabric with fastidious technical consistency, the wall went up as tectonic sculpture.

- Adam Herring, “Shimmering Foundation: The Twelve-Angled Stone of Inca Cusco,” Critical Inquiry, Autumn 2010.

**Edit:**  Several comments questioned my use of ""nearly a thousand years."" Here's where I got that figure: according to wikipedia, Cusco was founded in 1100, and then occupied by the Inca ""from the 13th Century to the 16th Century."" I have no idea when that particular stone was laid, but it seems to have been somewhere between 500 and 900 years ago.  I was intentionally vague with the date, since I don't know the exact century. I've also seen suggestions that it predates the Inca. If someone has that info, I'd appreciate you commenting with it!

**Edit 2:**  Just out of curiosity, I went through and counted: as of right now, there are 54 top-level comments jokingly asserting that this was aliens.  There are 17 top-level comments that are literally just the word ""aliens.""  In the time it took me to count, 4 more were added.

[deleted]not gonna lie, but i'm kinda turned on by this...you should have seen their score at tetris....Why couldn't they have just made them all brick shaped and saved time and whatever they used for money back then. These guys were obviously getting paid by the hour.Ancient Aztec masons were agents of the Mexican Nuevo World Order as directed by the Illuminachos. I'm not saying it's aliens...But totally aliens.If there's one thing I've realised, it's that humans a thousand (or more) years ago were just as intelligent as we are today. Sure they didn't have anything like the technology we have, but they were just as skilled and had equally rich and complex lives as those we have today.Meanwhile, [last week...](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_O38QHzM0tzw/S-YAkoeP58I/AAAAAAAAB20/7FQ5sd8tv7k/s1600/IMG_1133.JPG)[there's no end to what you can do when you don't give a fuck about particular people](http://i.imgur.com/7R6PWWN.jpg)Quick Background before comment:  I graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 with a degree in Architecture.  My thesis specifically focused on the integration of 3D printing technologies into masonry construction, using ancient approaches as a basis for design.

Now.  Something to know about these masonry walls is that they are not nearly as intricate and ""perfect"" as they appear to be.  From the outside (the face), the stones are chiseled using the surrounding stone as a basis.  On the interior of the wall, however, you will find that each of these stones is more ""wedge"" shaped, and is held in place with a plethora of smaller ""filler rocks.""  

From the outside, it looks impossible.  Once you look inside, you'll find that it's really just as simple as shaping one side of the rock, just along the edges.Peru was an amazing country to visit, I thoroughly enjoyed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. Some of the most amazing scenery. Anyone who has thought about going to Peru, fucking do it, spend at least a month there there's so much to see!

On a side note, I can't stand the ancient aliens bull shit. I don't think we give nearly enough credit to ancient peoples and their intelligence and ingenuity.

Airlines and the military have strict policies regarding weather conditions at takeoff and arrival, and weather enroute. Flying through thunderstorms deliberately is a pretty big no no in most cases, and when squall lines can be hundreds of miles long, it can cause a lot of problems.

Remember that the next time someone complains about weather delays or cancellations.. ask if they actually want to fly in weather the pilots don't even want to.am i the only one who for a second thought this would be a Delta flight pic from 1889Hi All.

What am I doing wrongHail can actually be encountered flying between 2 storms.  As it is can be violently thrown out of the clouds.  Now, couple that with the aircraft flying at say 400 knots and you can see the reason how and why this fucked up the plane so bad.

A regular guy who selflessly brought joy to sick children.

RIP man.  I'm really sorry to hear of his passing.

I think it would be nice if the makers of the Batman games and movies gave him a nod.

He was a real hero.Waking up to learn there's one less hero in the world made me suddenly feel very tired again. Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.So he pulled onto the left shoulder, but his car was still partially in the lane and somebody hit him. I wonder if his hazards were on, because that car is jet black and would be really hard to spot at night.I met this guy last year almost to the day. My daughter has a leg length discrepancy and we were at a specialist hospital in Baltimore and he was there giving all the kids lanyards and huge coloring books. We were really looking forward to seeing him again next month when we went back. R.I.P.According to the stories I've read, Mr. Robinson would stop by the nurse's station before he left to find out if there were any children too sick to come out to see him, so that he could make sure to go in to see them specifically.

That's the key to his character.  This wasn't about attention or fame or publicity or promoting some cause of business.  We wouldn't know who this guy was if he hadn't gotten a speeding ticket and accidentally gone viral.  He kept right on doing the same thing after he got famous as he did before he got famous.  And the most important thing to him was that sick kid who wasn't able to come out to see him.

Bruce Wayne is a fiction; an entertaining fiction, but a fiction.  Lenny Robinson was a real man who is a role model for thoughtfulness, selflessness, and making a difference in a small way.

Batman was real, and his name was Lenny Robinson.Here is a video of Lenny visiting sick kids in the hospital.  He truly was a hero deserving of the name, Batman.  The world is a darker place without him.   RIP Batman.

https://youtu.be/fDDBJajLZwwLenny was in a documentary called Legends of the Knight that is on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/title/80014903) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/795787), if anyone wants to check out his story and see him in action. It's about people who use Batman as an inspiration for themselves or others.

Seeing the kids respond to him is incredible. The world lost a great man.Batman taken out by a Toyota Camry.  This world is fucked up.Too bad it wasn't [this guy instead](http://i.imgur.com/IMc8Kiv.jpg)A tad late to things, but Lenny was actually very close to one of my best friends and his family. A group of my friends (whom all play SSBM together, shouts out to /r/smashbros and the Melee Community) all learned of Lenny's passing this morning straight from our buddy. Although the loss was hard for him and his family, I feel its important to highlight the good that Lenny put into this world. Admittedly, I did not know Lenny nearly as closely as my friend or his family, but I do recall a very specific memory I had with Lenny a couple years ago. At my friend's Bar Mitzvah Lenny was there decked out in full batman attire. He was a class act by all definitions, and went out of his way to make sure every kid, myself included had a memorable experience. An entertaining, genuine, loving individual, Lenny aka Uncle Batman will be missed. RIP Uncle Batman. He was a hero this world needed.

Proof: My friend, the dopest Marth/Fox main in the world with his partner in justice Uncle Batman. Although they weren't technically related, Lenny was considered part of his family.

...so help me jesusIf there is an afterlife, he's going to the good side of town. He clearly lived a cool life if he had the money to buy a lambo and a batsuit. He then had the heart to use that for a greater good and in the process gave us all some laughs. RIP Lenny.Such a shame, my son was in a children's hospital and this gentleman was there with his 60's Batmobile that he had recently purchased and was driving back east with.  Got some pics of the [Batmobile](http://i.imgur.com/nKnRe63.jpg?1) and my son still has his [autograph](http://i.imgur.com/XlrPgMI.jpg) hanging up in his room.  
He not only put some smiles on the kids faces but also everyone at the hospital that went out to check out the car.  He was the Hero we needed that day.*batman voice* just here in my garage, with my new Lamborghini that I bought. Fun to drive around Gotham. You know what I like better than Lamborghini's...JUSTICEThats terrible. He's more of a hero than the guy he was dressed as and probably never realized it. RIP Lenny. You were a Batman among men.i live in maryland. i can not tell you how many times since i got my license over 20 years ago now,  the countless people that have been killed by their cars breaking down and them getting out and standing near their car on the side of the road, attempting to change a flat tire, or are under the hood checking the engine. 95 percent of the time these people are safely out of the driving lanes and yet people still manage to hit them. im telling you now for anyone who doesnt know about maryland: 

MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.

ive never seen worse drivers. and ive lived in huge cities. it is the worst here for accidents like this one. it is the reason why we have the highest insurance rates in the united states. if you have the unfortunate problem of living here or for some ungodly reason decide to visit here as a tourist im going to give you a little advice: 

- IF YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE MEDIAN TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE WALL, AND IF THERE IS GRASS BY THE MEDIAN PULL ALL THE WAY OVER INTO THE GRASS!

- NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR CAR ON A MARYLAND HIGHWAY TO CHANGE A TIRE OR LOOK AT YOUR ENGINE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  IF YOU HAVE A FLAT DRIVE IT ON THE SIDE MEDIAN UNTIL YOU CAN FIND AN EXIT. EVEN IF IT MEANS DAMAGING YOUR RIM. YOUR RIM IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE. 

- IF IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CAR CANNOT BE FIXED DO NOT SIT IN YOUR CAR WAITING UNTIL HELPS ARRIVES!! EVEN IF YOU ARE SAFELY OFF TO THE SIDE. PEOPLE HERE WILL STILL HIT YOU! GET OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE AND STAND AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE. IT MAY BE INCONVENIENCING, BUT YOU'LL BE ALIVE. PEOPLE DIE IN THEIR CARS HERE ALL THE TIME SITTING IN THEM WAITING FOR HELP OR A TOW TRUCK. 

again i reiterate, MARYLAND PEOPLE CAN NOT DRIVE.  take every precaution you can if your car breaks down on a highway here. And a positive light in the world goes out. sad day. Met this guy in person when a psychology practice with which I'm affiliated co-produced a batman documentary. He was a hero who happened to dress up like another hero.

Legit cried when I learned of his passing.*We die every day. A thousand times an hour. Anyone who does this work sees it. Death. Their own... their partner's... their loved ones. We go to work anyway. Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind. Death is powerless against you if you do your job.*
- Batman, JLA Vol 1 72Karma did the opposite here. What a shame. The person who caused his death needs to do the right thing and take over for Lenny Robinson as Batman.>Elizabeth later told him that she was being bullied by other kids at her elementary school. “They don’t believe that Batman is my friend,” she told him.  So, Robinson went to school with her, appearing in full costume before the student body. He told them bullying was wrong and called her onstage to give her a Batman necklace.  Elizabeth, he announced, is my friend.

Who wants a tutorial?

Edit: I'll make a tutorial tomorrow, sorry but it's not a straight forward filter like you're hoping (I was too!). Some people have asked if you just fold the image, that's certainly possible but as you've all seen it creates major artefacts, due to the warping. It's a great place to start though as it helps to establish what you should be aiming for. Those of you familiar with Photoshop this technique is essentially a matte painting especially with more complicated images. 

Basically you don't bend the image, you duplicate, rotate as necessary and then mask the connecting line with any techniques you can. Such as using the clone tool or selecting objects and spreading them across the connecting line to conceal the stitch. Oceans and beaches work well because our eyes are expecting to see repeated patterns which can hide the appearance of repeated sections. 

I'm pretty sure you chaps who are familiar with photoshop will get the idea. I think it does look better than the original because of that slant on the left. And the contrast between the land and the sea makes it even better. Amazing job! This one looks better! Good job!I thought this image looked familiar. I've used it before in my work

One thing to note about this photographer is that he actually dressed up to go to the wedding.

Having been to quite a few weddings now, a shocking amount of photographers turn up dressed like it's a hacky sack tournament on the college lawn. Dear all men (and/or women): take everything out of your suit pockets before the photo session. I am sorry I am not staring at you, I am taking your picture.My best friend is a wedding photographer/videographer, and it's honestly amazing the more I watch how much angles, lens, filter can change a shot. My sisters wedding was outdoors, and it happened to be overcast when it was supposed to be sunny and an unprecedented rain actually moved in later in the evening (damn TX weather), but you couldn't even tell in any of the shots. He made sure all pictures were taken from angles where the little bit of sun was in the background, made amazing use of the natural lighting, and always panned the video to pick up the most natural light etc. It looked so good and made my sister so happy. That guy has a great eye for photography. He's going places!For a split second I thought he was dead and I thought of Rick and Morty :(

The smell of the chewy goodness inside that bag just inches away tormented Herbie in his dreams.  In time, his frustration would give way to murderous rage...THAKS MAN THAKS ALOT!That's kinda a cool idea.

Edit: [just wow](http://imgur.com/qBLSJ5s)I lived with a roommate who had a great dog.  I loved that dog to the moon and back.  But it would bark at passers by.  It's the single only aggressive thing she ever did.  We didn't want her barking at the neighbors or their kids so we used to say ""No, dog!  No barking!""  and she'd just look at us, then keep barking.

Then one day I kind of imagined what must be going through her head...  

She's like, ""OH FUCKING SHIT! There are some assholes outside our badass good-guy-team castle! They're THREATENING our goddamn HOME fuckin' BASE!! RARARARAWR RAHRAWR!!!!""

And all she gets from us is just, ""Bad, Dog! SHHHHHHhhhhhh! No Barking!!""

Panicked, she puzzles out the problem, realizing suddenly, *Oh SHIT! That's right!  You two helpless yet lovable lumps don't have the amazing sense of smell and super-dog-hearing that I do!*  But not to worry, that's exactly her job.  Let the humans know what's going on so they can let her out the front door to start killing shit.

Dauntless, she vows not to let the interlopers get by without warning everyone in the house first. 

""I WILL FUCKING PROTECT YOUUUUUUUuuuu! RHAWRHAHRAHRAWR RAWRRAH!!""

And suddenly feel like the poor girl is just trying to keep us safe.  So after I imagined this whole scenario out I kind of decided to try changing my approach the next time.  So the following interaction went completely differently.

She started barking, and this time instead of, ""Shhh, NO!"" I was like ""Good Job, pooch! I see them too!"" And I came up and patted her on the back.  And she chilled right the hell out.  Back to her nap.

I swear this worked 100% of the time.  She even kind of just started the habit of looking at me. If I was looking back she would just let it be.

""We good? Yeah, we good.""

I miss that dog.  She's old now but still healthy. My roommate and I moved out of that place.  He's got some kids for the dog to play with so she's probably very happy.  

But I felt like the damn dog whisperer when I pulled that mind meld shit with the dog.  I bet it'll work for others too.  Seriously try it.  Let me know.

[Edited some formatting mistakes]Am I the only one who wouldn't trust random strangers with this?Of course now he will forever be pestering passers by for treats, which could potentially make some people quite nervous.Now he'll learn to bark at strangers to get a treat. Cute idea, not solid in practice. On the other hand, that could be the lesser of two weevils.ITT:  Lots of people who don't understand how dogs work.That's a great idea! But aren't you afraid that he will warm up to strangers given this habit even if it's a robber in the middle of the night?Irish Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier? What if he accidentally bites someone and they call animal control?Has nobody noticed that they spelt it thaks, not thanks?I don't agree with this approach, especially in this context. Dog will grow to expect treats from strangers. What about the one time that the stranger puts their hand out and there is no treat?  I'd prefer food refusal from strangers and to engage/train the dogs with other people around in order to desensitize them.As great as this idea may seem, it's extremely counter intuitive.
I'm certified by the APDT and focus on dog psychology and behavior, and the first and foremost important thing to remember is that dogs are not humans and their psychology is completely different. Something that works one way in the human world can have a drastic difference in the minds of dogs.

I can go on for days as of why I would not recommend the method displayed in OP's picture, but I'll try to keep it short. I once worked with a 7 year old German Shepard named Daisy. Daisy had two bad habits; she would bark at the door when someone would stand outside/attempt to enter, and she was also terrified of fireworks. As humans, when we see that someone we care about is afraid of something, we tend to nurture them and tell them that ""it's all going to be alright,"" etc. People do the exact same thing with their dogs when they seem scared or startled; they pet them and nurture them. The problem with this is the fact that what you're actually doing, despite of your good intentions, is encouraging their fear. Petting a dog is a form of encouragement and by petting them or nurturing them when their minds are in a scared state, you're actually feeding into the issue rather than helping it.

Now, back to Herbie. If Herbie has a fear of bypassers, then having them reward her state of mind is not what you'd want to do. You have to make sure (this is really important!) that you reward the right state of mind. Dogs live in the now; not yesterday or tomorrow. You have to make sure you can comprehend what state of mind your dog is in before you start rewarding them with treats. 

Those are just my two cents...Fence aggression is caused by the neglectful action of leaving dogs unattended outside in a yard. 

The dog sees a passerby and begins barking. 

The passerby has no reason to stop and engage the dog and so continues on their way. 

The dog associates the passerby leaving as their having driven them off.

This gets reinforced every time that a passerby transits the fence line.

The real solution is to actually TRAIN your dog to not ever bark at passerby by staying with them during the first TWO years of their life when outside to properly TRAIN them not to be an ANNOYING noise disturbance, NOT hand the responsibility over to strangers that don't want hear your dog BARKING at them, not to mention the neighbors, and be tasked with doing what YOU should be doing.

tl;dr It's your dog, you fucking train it.Herbie The Love DogBefore:
Bark bark bark (get away from my home!)

After:
Bark bark bark (give me treats!)From a veterinary student: Never punish a dog to treat fear. You would be pairing fear with fear which strengthens the initial fearful stimulus. Just wanted to say that first so people don't beat their dogs when they cower at fireworks. Now for the initial case, giving him treats when he barks at people he will bark more. He thinks ""whenever I bark I get treats"". So you reinforce the behavior. Unfortunately there is not a great way to treat this one if the owner isn't present because people ignoring the dog and walking by makes him think ""barking at people makes them leave"". And if this is his goal, the behavior has been reinforced. However the case with fireworks is a little different. This would be an example of counterconditioning.

Eh, who cares?I used to be the guy that thought about leaving a note.  Then I saw this comic.
http://spillmybeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/funny-parking-problems-comic-picture.jpgWhen I was a kid my dog got really sick and we rushed her to the vet. My dad parked shittily like the guy in your pic because he was in such a hurry to get the dog looked at. The dog died while we were in there and when we left someone had left a note under my dad's wiper saying he was an asshole for parking like that. I never saw my dad look as defeated as he did in that moment.

TL;DR - You never know what someone else is dealing with. I'm getting a beer.[deleted]That is clearly a tortoiseKeep in mind, it is not fair to judge someone's parking ability if you don't actually watch them as they are parking. It is pretty likely that the car you are looking at was forced to park like this due to someone else being parked improperly next to them.In High School, the girl who parked in front of me was 1-2 feet into my spot EVERY FUCKING DAY. I just let it go, but by the end of the year, I was like whatever, I'll leave a funny note. 

""Just so you know  -- (insert drawn picture of a ruler with an arrow pointing at the 12 inch mark)

you were this far into my spot every day this year. 

Best of luck with your future parking endeavors.""

She then made a point to yell ""asshole"" out the window at me whenever she saw me from that point on -- obviously not finding it as funny as I did. This is an incredibly passive aggressive way to behave.

We can still tip but the tip jar is near the register and probably need to ask for it.

The incentive for good service is not getting your ass fired while someone else takes you reasonably paying job.Wow, this thread is amazing-- thanks for the attention, everyone!  My little restaurant is flattered.  Just wanted to give you guys (and particularly the servers/ cooks/ restaurant owners out there) more details on what we're doing and how we do it!

First, it's not simply an increased hourly wage!  In addition to fully funded benefits for EVERY employee, full or part time, and $15/ hour, they all get a portion of the sales.  Waitstaff get 12% of their individual sales (remember, servers used to tip out 6% of their sales, so that's like a guaranteed 18% from every table, including takeout.)  Kitchen & support staff get a percentage of the shift's sales, depending on their roles. 

It's removed the judgement, assumptions, and emotions that living off tips entailed; my servers love that.  And of course I don't take any cash they DO receive; if they do so well that someone wants to reward them extra, more power to them, that's theirs to keep.  And it happens... because my staff is incredible :)  

Come visit us in San Francisco sometime!Reddit loves a great tipping thread, but what this restaurant is saying is that ALL of their staff (bussers, dishwashers, cooks &amp; servers) are paid a living wage.  Kudos.

Serving is tough, but the kitchen is just as valuable to the dining experience. The restaurant that I work at pays minimum wage, we get tipped, but we also get profit sharing. We also get fully funded health, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) with employer match and discounts to climbing gyms and other places to boot. 

I enjoy working there.Are there any servers here that wouldn't be okay with this? My friend is a server and she says she regular makes $20+ / hour when you average her tips, and closer to $30 if she does that thing that absolutely no servers do - not reporting their tips to the IRS. That is a sweet benefits package I must say, but she's told me she'd quit serving if she ever averaged less than $20 / hr.Picture of a menu. I like the Italian way: no obligation, no forced tips, no shared jar. You liked the service exceptionally? Leave some extra money on the table when you leave. Your waiter will take it completely for himself.Redditor: ""Instead of a tip I have left you with this informative card which expains how the tip system exploits the lower class."" <tips fedora> ""M'lady.""So basically it's like how restaurants work in the entire rest of the world. USA takes another step forward!I hate the tip system in the U.S. 

As a black person, whenever I go to a restaurant, they think I won't tip, so they give me poor service. This leads me to want to tip poorly, but I still always give at least 15%. 

I wish tip wasn't part of it and it was just a fixed price.Sounds better than 

**35% Tip included in Menu Prices**so 20% markups are already included in the prices.I just went here! Really good. Really french waitress. That's OK. I'll take my tipping position which averages me around 30-35/hr.Move to Europe LOL Zazie is in SF. They're required by law to provide health insurance. It's also a California law to provide Paid Sick Leave. ""Living Wage,"" which is how much exactly? Because SF is fucking expensive and their poverty wage would go pretty far in Sacramento. I know I'm in the minority here, but I *like* the practice of tipping. It's one of the few times where I can, unilaterally, decide the value of a good or service **after** getting it. 

At the couple of restaurants where I show up at fairly regularly, I always get excellent service, they remember what I like, and treat me like I'm a valued customer. And I'm not by any means rich nor do I tip more than a pretty typical amount. 

I'd actually be disappointed to have tipping taken out of the equation in a lot of places. Define living wage...This is actually a great restaurant too. Good food, nice wine, neat ambiance. I've taken a few dates here. It's a nice spot if you find yourself in Cole Valley, SF. I'm glad we don't have tipping where I live.The fact remains that, at a flat daily wage, a busy day is worse for a waiter than a slow day.

The tip system, with all its flaws, does achieve one thing. It makes wait staff *want* the place to be bustling. It puts management and employees on the same page, keeping the place as busy as possible is how everybody gets their payday. 

When a waiter gets tips, they see a large party coming through the door and they get excited. When they don't, they see a large party coming through the door and they sigh. More work, same pay.As a hospitality worker in SF, this is as outrageous as it is hilarious.  They pay their employees $15 an hour, sounds like a lot for other parts of the country, but keep in mind that is set to be our *minimum* wage by 2017 (current minimum wage is $12.25).  Saying that is a livable wage for a restaurant in the Bay Area, nevertheless in SF itself is simply not true.  The total cost of living in San Francisco is 62.6% higher than the U.S. average, and we have the most brutal real estate/rent situation in the country right now (http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2015/06/02/san-franciscos-median-rent-hits-a-ridiculous-4225/)
A tipped position in the Bay Area allows you to make double or more than what they are paying.  Also, while I encourage them to let people know they are providing benefits and doing what ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY, but specifically discouraging any extra gratuities is silly and will hurt service in the long run.  They will lose real talent because competent and hospital servers/bartenders that go above and beyond will leave because working here is basically getting payed what you would at McDonalds.Tipping culture always confused me when I was younger and I used to visit the US a lot, having grown up in England. Here its basically set up as mentioned in the sign and the minimum wage is £6.50 an hour (although it's set to increase to £9.00 an hour) plus the government will pitch in quite generously in terms of benefits if you're stuck on minimum wage (but waiting staff normally are not, depending on the establishment). Saves a whole lot of hassle when paying though... And if you want to tip on top of that you can: for exemplary service.","{'Sadness': 0.05259, 'Emotional_Range': 0.788, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.081, 'Fear': 0.049403, 'Analytical': 0.37, 'Conscientiousness': 0.173, 'Agreeableness': 0.624, 'Joy': 0.060894, 'Disgust': 0.05457, 'Extraversion': 0.599, 'Openness': 0.222, 'Anger': 0.956596}",{'night sky': 0.908877}

It was also said to confer the power of invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.""

The kid on the right, on top of the van taking the picture, looks like it was photoshoped. I lived in South Africa for years. There is almost zero chance these are ""commuters"". This is almost certainly inside a park, and those cars are tourists specifically there looking for lions and other wildlife. Look at all the cameras. Lions don't just wander around Africa. They are very rare and highly prized tourist attractions, and they're in very specific, fenced (but extremely large, think hundreds, or even thousands of square miles) areas.

Africa is not huts and wildlife. Africa has cell phones and shopping malls and McDonalds and Adam Sandler movies, same as everywhere else.Nice BALLSMust not have been any dentists near the front of the lineNairobi is the only city in the world to have a national park right next to the city. People who live close to the park have at times encountered cheetahs and hyenas when coming back home from a night out. So yeah, lions can sometimes show up outside the park. But it isn't a common occurrence, though. TIL Nairobi drivers need laser pointers. Fucking cats man ... They do whatever they want and dont care who they inconvenience. Place a potted plant on a table in the middle of the Savannah with nothing around it for miles and you bet your ass a fucking lion will show up and knock it over.Those people in the front line of cars with their windows open, very ballsy.Lion 1:  They're totally looking at my ass aren't they?

Lion 2:  Yeah, keep it up. Let's see how long we can make them look at your ass.Just cats being cats.I wonder if they are siblings.It seems like there is quite a bit of room to...you know..._go around_.They were protesting for the ""Lion Lives Matter"" movement, in honor of Cecil.A lot of the animals in Kenya are way too comfortable around humans.

Pro-Weed cars, Ticket Fighting cars, so forth.hahahahaha. In my town it's illegal to paint your car up to resemble police cars.

Mostly because of the fight your traffic ticket companies abusing it.The airport staff here use cars that say ""Law Enforcement (supporter)"" with lettering so small you would barely notice that last part:
https://imgur.com/B1i4MeaA friend of mine from high school bought an all black Crown Vic with the rambar still installed. It scared the absolute shit out of people in the school parking lot when he came up behind them. This used to be an RCMP cruiser that was brought over from Nova Scotia. Have ahd it for 5 yrs. To the guy with the suggestion it should be to protect and seal I beg to differ. To paint and protect is synonymous with to serve and protect and has double meaning. We work mostly in Toronto and west GTA. For those who's business we'd lose solely based on this - I wouldn't want your business anyway.There's thousands of painters in the GTA. I like dealing with easy going people and will gladly leave your business to the other painting companies.

It was in the early to mid 1990s in Riverside California. I was standing outside of a backyard party ($3 at the gate). I think the Voodoo Glow Skulls or the Assorted Jelly Beans or Schlong or some other stupidly-named band was going to play. 

So I was outside I was,  waiting for some friends when from down the street came a slow moving car with a search light. Pandemonium broke out because the party was about to be busted. Shouts of ""five-oh! five-oh!"" were heard. People took off in every direction. They jumped over the back fences. I even heard someone tried to put the keg in the washing machine. 

So I'm out there and I'm afraid of nothing because I'm straight and I don't have pockets full of marijuana or speed. 

Slowly, slowly, the car comes up shining the spotlight.

The ""biggest"" horse on record is Sampson, a Shire horse 21.2 hands high by the time he was a four year old, when he was re-named Mammoth. His peak weight was estimated at 3,360 lb.  He was born in 1846, before Brooklyn was ever born.

Brooklyn ""only"" stood 19.2 hands high.  

The record-holder for ""biggest horse"" as of 2007 was a Shire horse named Tina who was 20 hands high.  Tina died in 2008 and was subsequently beaten by Big Jake, who is 20 hands *plus two and three-quarter inches* and still alive, holding the current record.  Big Jake weighs only 2,600 pounds compared to Sampson, but Guinness no longer records ""biggest"" by weight, but by height, so although Jake is much trimmer than either Brooklyn or Sampson, he still holds the title.

Edit: a ""hand"" is 4 inches.
That horse never skipped leg day. Or any day.Beautiful horse, horrible feet. His toe is so long, Id imagine he had a hard time moving especially considering his massive size. Imagine trying to walk with swimming flippers on your feet all day long!When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

It was before the Bears match yesterday[OP right after taking this picture](http://media.giphy.com/media/vJKeu2upniCSk/giphy.gif).Stealth - 11/10 

IGNI *just* finished two hours of reading about the development of the stealth bomber.  TIL:  That a scale model was made with the functional RCS technique and placed atop a $186,000 pole to make it high enough to fire radar at it.  When the radar returned only a blip for the pole, the operator sent guys to put the plane back on top, as it has clearly fallen off.  It had not.  

BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS ALL 'MURICA. 

Unsatisfied, apparently, with seeing the blip of the pole...they ordered the design and construction of *a new pole made with stealth capabilities.*  They made an effin stealth *pole.*  No info on how many workers died running into it while setting it up.

Bonus TIL:  1)Stealth bombers were the first planes ever designed by a team lead by the electrical engineer.  2)When designing the shape of the plane, they created software to test for the desired effect on radar systems.  They were unable to even consider panels that were curved, as the the computers running the test algorithms would still be working on the results *today,* which is why they are flat.  This design and the total lack of traditional aerodynamics led to it being nicknamed Hopeless Diamond.  This could have so easily been photo shopped and I wouldn't even be mad if it was.Where was this taken?For all who say they need proof, this is as much as I can do, [the next shot](http://i.imgur.com/RNxF7re.jpg) in the HDR burst.

If you can look past the god-awful quality/sharpness/resolution of the image (are you using consumer gear or a point and shoot?) and even further past the basic compositional errors (have you ever studied any other wedding photography before?) the photos still don't appear to have any of effort put into colour correction, cropping, lens issue correction, or any other kind of post production.

You should be less concerned about slipping in ""clever"" reflections, and actually focus on learning how to use a camera. You are far, far from the point where you should be watermarking your images and calling yourself a professional.

Reminds me of an unrelated joke about airplanes!

**A** small two-seater Cessna 152 plane crashed into a cemetery early this afternoon.

Search and rescue workers have found two survivors and recovered 300 bodies so far and expect that number to climb as digging continues into the evening.I saw one in person and it literally unsettled me.  It's very very strange looking at it closely; it's like your sense of vision goes a little bit wonky and your point of focus kind of slips and slides off the lines of the fuselage leaving with you a sense that it's unnatural and that even after having examined it closely you're still not sure of its shape, like it wasn't designed by humans.

It was much more advanced than reasonably possible in the 60's, heck, it still is 50 years later and I say that it's the sexiest machine ever built.

EDIT: Didn't intend to insinuate aliens.  Go watch a proper documentary, ya bunch o' loonies!An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.

""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

If you enjoyed that story, check out the subreddit dedicated to the Blackbird: /r/SR71I use to live in Mildenhall, U.K. for all of my childhood life.  Seeing these taking off and landing was amazing.  I use to bunk off school to go down the landing lights to watch these fly out. The air shows they had every year allowed you to get up close and talk to the pilots.  Stunning planes! Definite highlight for me at the museum of flight in SeattleYou can view one of these lovely planes at Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.My husband and I were crew chiefs on the KC-135Q model at Beale AFB.  One night we got the call, grabed our mobility bags and headed for the flightline.  We ended up flying to Florida, landing and refueling, took back off and when we got to altitude we called down to Control in Florida, who then placed a call to California to tell them that we were at altitude over Florida.  Then and only then, did the SR take off in California so that we could refuel them over Florida.   That is fast!  When your refuel plane has to be in the air and ready all the way across the country before you can even take off.  The 135 had to go full throttle during the refuel, that think shook so bad one would think that it was going to shake apart.  Crew chiefs were allowed to lay in the boom pod with the boomer during the refuel.  It was awesome!""WHYYYYYYYY?!....WHY YOU AL-WAYS KICK ME WHEN III'M....HIIIIIGGGGHHHHH?!""Airplane?  This shit was designed to haunt dreams.  Not carry passengers.Should out to evergreen aviation museum, it has one partially opened sr71, the spruce goose, and a myriad of other cool fighters, jet liners, and even a free tanks. Just outside Mcminnville, OregonI've always wondered what replaced the SR-71's role in the modern day air force.X-Jet?http://imgur.com/aETYDXBA few random items. All planes get metal fatigue with microscopic cracks, that over a lifetime, will eventually ground the airframe. The SR-71 was composed of titanium and heated up so much during its flights, that the plane would stretch about a foot in length and the heat would soften the metal so much that it would fill in the cracks. The airframe was basically reforged every flight. It also got more and more fuel efficient the faster it flew. The only limitation on its top speed was the engine cones would melt after Mach 3.7 or so. The A-12 flew slightly higher and slightly faster because it was lighter with only having 1 person on board and 1 bay for reconnaissance as opposed to the SR-71's 3 bays for reconnaissance.

Also, Wright Patterson is the world's oldest and largest aviation museum. They are moving the presidential and experimental planes to the main campus next spring so you will no longer have to take a shuttle bus or miss those exhibits if and when you visit.You might like [this](http://www.nmusafvirtualtour.com/media/068/SR-71A%20Front%20Cockpit.html) a 3d view of the cockpit.

He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""

Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""

And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""

I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""

It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.Reminds me (a little) of the Naboo Starfighter from Star Wars: Episode I","{'Sadness': 0.065182, 'Emotional_Range': 0.69, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.259, 'Fear': 1.0, 'Analytical': 0.353, 'Conscientiousness': 0.251, 'Agreeableness': 0.777, 'Joy': 0.074583, 'Disgust': 0.052831, 'Extraversion': 0.682, 'Openness': 0.345, 'Anger': 0.583642}","{'animal': 0.952574, 'bird': 0.989013}"

PM me if you need something new and I'll get you something as cheap as I can get it without getting fired.check your TV, it might be a prop as well It's dangerous because that material is likely HIGHLY flammable.  Beds must have a flame resistance to them, and since thats NOT a bed, its a PROP, it could go up in flames instantly. It was fit for a queen, however I'm pretty sure there was a pea in the mattress.

Smells like a lawsuit.

At the very least they need to buy you a new Mattress and a 10 pack of visits to your local Chiropractor's office (mine does $75 for an extended visit with heat and electrical stimulus if you pay in cash)This is a lawsuit if it's actually real. Canadian here chiming in; that is seriously wrong. In Canada, all hotels must pass a bi-monthly law of the ""soft touch"" bed test. They actually have people visit and test hotel beds for softness.Do you live in Sudden Valley?Brings a whole new meaning to death bed.People used to always joke about why it is against the law to rip tags off of mattresses. This is why it's the law, so you don't buy a dud mattress from a shady dealer. (Though, it can be removed by the consumer, so you're lucky it is still there.)Sounds like it's from the Bluth model home.I would check your lease documents to see if there is any stipulations about the furniture, have a lawyer review it as well and write the landlord a letter to have a new mattress purchased or at least a prorated amount to purchase a new one. Also renters insurance might cover some chiropractic visits to help with the back pain. Most of all talk to a lawyer to see if there is a legal avenue for you to pursue. 
good luck!I wonder if Michael Bluth had this problem.Is this your house?

You've got it backwards. The terrifying pit into the abyss is not wheelchair accessible. The surface world is wheelchair accessible.[""worry not fragile one""](http://pbfcomics.com/270)I volunteered at Carlsbad for 5 weeks 10+ years ago  through the student conservation association. 

Fun facts:

* visitors are only allowed to walk down the natural entrance, they have to take the elevator up  (rangers/volunteers walk against the flow, so to meet more people)
* there are lots of formations that they don't tell you about; like a ll the ""lint-ites"":  lint from people's clothes that get stuck on the formations.  volunteers come in the summer to clean the cave. (with hoses and tweezers)
* it's 59 degrees and 90% humidity downstairs, while it can be 95 degrees and really dry upstairs
* the best lighted formation in the cave is not labelled.  it's  to the left of the elevator in the big room, it's called the ""virgin of guadelupe"" (rangers are not allowed to point it out)
* it takes 90 years for something to grow as big as the tip of your pinky (from the last knuckle to the tip).  They know this because a passage was created between two rooms for a tour, and the stalactites growing on the ceiling of that new man-made passage (in 1920; well; now almost 100 years old) are that large. (for the kings-queens tour)
* lighting was done by professional stage /theater lighters.  Lighting for cave pictures is *really hard*.  if you go, I recommend just buying the post cards.
[Speaking of a wheelchair accessible pit into the abyss...](http://i.imgur.com/6ghcdDq.jpg)I remember this place for all the wrong reasons.

Our family took a 3 week long road trip around America and we stopped here. It was myself, Mom and Dad, and 4 other brothers. 3 of my brothers went ahead while my other brother (call him Brett) stayed with me  (still ahead of my parents). I was 10 at the time and I just remember Brett wandering in a small circle in the middle of the path looking up at the top. I called out his name, he collapsed and I immediately ran and got my parents. People passing by offered and hand while I ran and got help from paramedics.My dad and Brett went back up while my mom and I continued downward (she physically couldn't walk back up the ramp). Terrified and concernced, we continued on the path with some of the darkest blackness we'd ever experienced trying to find my other 3 brothers. long story short, we find a ranger after a wn hour or so, describe my brothers to her and guides us to the bottom. Thankfully my brother recovered and we continued on our trip with just a 1 day delay.

TL;DR: On vacation here brother collapsed from a seizure and we lost 3 of my brothers in the cavernWas there last weekend. Can confirm, there was a guy who almost ran over my toes with a motorized wheelchair 750 ft below ground. Probably took the elevator though.

Zoom in and look at the sharks eyes. That's what a surprised shark looks like. That's a juvenile bull shark, so it will give you a nasty nip but is not really dangerous. They are in pretty much every river and residential canal estate in Australia. Bull sharks are born and grow up in fresh water, entering the ocean when they are grown, where they are indeed a bunch of dicks.

There are two types of croc in Australia: freshwater crocs (aka freshies), and saltwater crocs (aka salties). Brutus is a salty.

Determining the difference is easy enough. Simply jump into the river. If the croc quietly climbs out on the opposite bank and gives you a surly look, it's a freshie.

If the croc surges toward you, grabs your leg and pulls you under the water in a choas of flailing limbs, rolls around a few times and drowns you, then swims off and plants your body in a mud bank,  returning to take a bite from your rotting corpse every couple of days, then it was a salty.He stopped the shark from drowning. Brutus is a hero.Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction. Physically unchanged for a hundred million years, because it's the perfect killing machine. A half ton of cold-blooded fury, the bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong it can dissolve bones and hoofs.As the shark was valiant, I honour him: but, as the shark was ambitious, I ate him.Call me dumb but I had no idea sharks and crocodiles lived in the same waters.[I prefer this one](http://i.imgur.com/Nrxp5wG.gif)The Shark probably made the mistake of considering Brutus his trusted advisor.He's giant, how do they find him?

I went to Paris in 2013 and they were there are the time.Just for info, since this perspective of ""Paris"" is so common, but it's misleading. The photo is taken from the Montparnasse tower. You see a zoom of the Eiffel Tower in the foreground, and the Business district of La Défense in the background, but those towers of La Défense aren't in Paris proper. They're in the suburbs.

Flash forward a few decades and a renovation in that spot created a room that needed a window for Cleveland building code reasons. Now there is a window.Cleveland baby! Knew I recognized it, then zoomed in and was reassured. In the spirit of ""I want a god damn window"" I like to imagine the common office worker, coming in on a weekend with an appropriate rented saw and just did the hole himself, patched up a cheap window in there, cleaned up everything and came back on monday to his ordinary office, which is now the only one with a window.It almost looks like another building use to be attached to that one? Or could it just be a shadow... No biggie, that's just room 1408.  OSHA regs. That's the fire escape.Sniper perch.I knew that building looked familiar, Clevelander for life :3One of the cool things that gets glossed over about Cleveland is that each of the buildings are old enough to carry some history. It may not be the caliber that Europe has, but over 100 years of development and change isn't paltry either. 

One of the defining statements of major cities these days are skyscrapers. If you think about it skyscraper technology isn't that old, only exploding in the past 50 years or so. 50 years ago, Cleveland was a fully functioning, top 10 US city. There was really no need to build up a brand new huge building (and you couldn't really). Excluding a few buildings in NYC, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in the world for 20 years and the US for 30. 

Unfortunately by this time the companies and jobs that made up Cleveland were being moved elsewhere and any new developments were quickly cancelled. That combined with the invention that is the air conditioner and Cleveland slowly lost it's status. We were still a top 10 city in 1970 which wasn't *that* long ago.

Regarding these tourism videos, yes I am from Ohio and I do currently live in Cleveland (what makes you think I'm biased?). I remember when these videos came out and laughing at how spot on they were. To some extent they still are. HOWEVER. Things are looking up and a lot of new social places are opening up. We've getting back into the skyscraper phase with a nice hotel that'll hopefully be ready for the RNC (it will but nothing will work). And finally, if this nuCLEus project goes forward, it'll be interesting to see what else spawns from that. 

Will Cleveland ever return to status it used to have? No, least not in any reasonable time frame. It's cold and that's something we can't change and compete with. Cleveland does have a distinct advantage of not having to worry about natural disasters. So who knows, maybe in 300 years we'll be relevant again.I hope he's happy now, watching the world through his tiny little window.Plot twist, it's a broom closet.MedianerasMy dad used to know a guy that worked at the broadcast control room at the top of the CN Tower.  The room was all [concrete walls, blaring cooling fans, and TV signal displays.](http://www.roadwolf.ca/files/blogpics/CNTower/94538.jpg)  He said he was getting miserable, possibly S.A.D., from never seeing the sunlight.

So he asked management about installing a single porthole window.  He pressured them enough that they actually bothered to look into it, and they said it would cost $20,000, and that they were willing to pay for half if he paid for the other half.  Never did get the porthole installed.

Guy had some cool stories though.  Like [the Northeast Blackout of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) - he said you could see the power rolling out from block to block - it didn't just all immediately shut off at once, it moved like a wave in the ocean.  Of course, he didn't have his camera.

He also got us in the CN Tower for free, through the basement security entrance, and we got to see the cool control room at the top of the tower that visitors can't see.  

EDIT: Since folks are interested, I'll share this cool photo:

Visitors who don't know New York history sometimes assume it's all a carefully preserved green space from before the city existed, but that's not at all the case. Central Park was consciously conceived, laid out, and constructed beginning in the 1850s in response to the need for city-dwellers to have a place to ""escape"" to, and while it incorporated a few vacant spaces, much of it was reclaimed ground covered with temporary dwellings. Central Park is one of the great monuments to deliberate urban planning, most of it the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.

Edit: spelling... New York is a magnificent. Hi Everyone! I am Kayte Dolmatch - the photographer of this image. I'd like to clear a few things up:
1) This is my image and only my image
2) The very first time this was posted anywhere was on my flickr page with my watermark on November 20th 2014. https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaytedolmatch/15647565470/in/album-72157627317857063/ 
3) I submitted the photo to National Geographic in August of 2015 as part of an assignment ""From Above"". National Geographic prefers users to upload images without a watermark so I removed the watermark on the file I uploaded to their site.
4) To my pleasant surprise my image was voted Top Shot on National Geographic Your Shot - which meant it got ""published"" on their instagram and their blog (tumblr). This is the unwatermarked version that people have been stealing and posting all over the internet.
5)I have no problem with my image being circulated as long as the proper credit is provided - I'm so pleased that so many are touched by this photograph and really enjoy it.
6) I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark III, which allows the artist to record their name as the artist on every single image taken with the camera - this is captured in the metadata. Also seen on my flickr link
7)If you are interested in purchasing a print of this image please feel free to contact me at kathleendolmatch@yahoo.com
8) Thank you for reading this. Have a lovely day

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that ""stealing"" is not the correct term and I agree. ""Sharing without citing""  would have been more accurate. My image has gone viral on multiple websites without proper citation and I was frustrated when I made my original post. By the way, the apartment building in the center of the image with the gray gabled roof and green features is The Dakota, where John Lennon lived and was killed. Directly across in the park is an area called Strawberry Fields.

It is the epitome of the need for escape from the urban cityscape and into the greenery, surrounded by two of my favourite museums, a one stop shop for getting away from the craziness that can be the city.Just went to central park for the first time yesterday. I found it to be an absolute gem among the massive concrete jungle that is NYC. The fact that they planned this over a
150 years ago and no one has either tried or been able to develop that land into more monstrous buildings is amazing. Central Park is probably my favorite place on Earth besides my bedJust a little fun fact, the lake in central park was originally a water reservoir for the NYC water supply. In Rio De Janiero, Christ the redeemer and the favelas have an interesting juxtaposition as well.So much beauty on the left. So much money on the right.I love to find  interesting buildings in New York. Look them up on google earth. Then look at the history behind them. How busy is Central Park on an average day? I cant imagine it supporting all those people...I love living in L.A. and I think it just might be one of the best cities in the world, but I wanna visit New York one day!  It seems like an awesome place to live !I really need to get to NY with my camera one day :(The demarcation is unbelievable. You can go in five minutes from being overrun by people to basically being alone in a forest. Ah, must be where the biome changes.

But poor Rhino.  He had such good intentions.   Creationist rhino stops baby zebra from becoming a fossil.The world tricks you into thinking shit is all right but then **BLAM!** the zebra actually got disemboweled.I think these pictures are reversed.  The rhino is obviously putting the zebra in the mud.Relevant: http://youtu.be/BZYjJn0Va5YWhy is the Rhino displaying cross-species altruistic behavior? That's what I wanna know. What a waste that would be some awesome fossil in few million years...ARTAX!!!!!!Regardless of the outcome, this shows rhinos' horns are much better used by rhinos than by alternative medicine.Can we finally stop the poacher hate? Every time someone poaches a rhino horn, he's really just saving the life of a zebra. He's the great kodo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koSq-KecPm4TIL Rhinos are good people. :D

So we'd get these newlyweds coming in, and they were handed  a 3.16oz bottle of champagne, a four-piece box of cheap chocolates, and it wasn't a Jacuzzi hot tub, but a Jacuzzi bathtub. I didn't work there for very long because I refused to sell the package. We had one guy get so angry, he jumped the counter, grabbed a bunch of chocolates and bottles of champagne, and left with his bride. Didn't even stay at our hotel.

I mean it has very nice seating, but that is about it.

The tv and the projector screen are rather small, there are skylights and these strange candles in the front. It might be some sort of stage or chapel or something. It looks more like some place where someone would give a sales pitch about some amazing multi-level marketing opportunity or a sermon about how much god wants you to give the preacher money.http://i.imgur.com/GhFBRxh.gifThat is AWFUL.

Ridiculousthe skylights weren't a good choice either.I see a pull down projector screen.

ITT: Michiganders and slightly confused and disgruntled New Yorkers>Coney Islands are a unique type of Greek American restaurant. Two of the most well-known Coney Island restaurants are the Lafayette Coney Island and the American Coney Island, which are located adjacent to one another on Lafayette St. in downtown Detroit. They have a common root, with the original restaurant having been established by Greek immigrant brothers Bill and Gus Keros in 1914. The brothers got into business dispute soon thereafter, and in 1917 split their restaurant into the two establishments that exist today.

>The menu of all Coney Island restaurants centers on the Coney Island hot dog, which is a natural casing hot dog in a steamed bun dressed with chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard. This item is usually referred to simply as a ""coney."" Another popular item on most Coney Island restaurant menus is the ""loose hamburger,"" which consists of crumbled ground beef in a hot dog bun, covered in the same condiments as a Coney Island hot dog. Many Coney Islands also serve ""chili fries,"" which are french fries covered in chili, sometimes with mustard or cheese added.

>Many Coney Islands offer other Greek and Greek-American dishes, such as Gyros, Souvlaki, Shish Kebab, Spanakopita, Saganaki, and Greek salads, as well as usual American diner fare, such as regular hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, and desserts.

TILThis is the place at 6 and Haggerty, right?ITT: Coney 2015You have a Coney Island?From Michigan, outside of Detroit, still blows me away no one else in the world knows what a coney island is. This place runs on Coney Islands.

Edit: Glad to hear these are popping up elsewhere. I'm just used to puzzled looks when I mention a coney outside of the areaI'm so excited to see a post about Coney's on the front page! Also so cool to see the interest from non-Michiganders. I grew up in the Detroit area where they are everywhere however I'm in Lansing now and there are only a few.

The most important things a coney must have, to me, are as follows:

1. You can get both Detroit and Flint style.
2. The place is a little gritty (which is why I prefer Lafayette over American, the atmosphere in there is amazing)
3. Someone working there has to be speaking (or yelling) Greek. If they are, you know the place is legit.
4. Bonus points if they have Vernor's and Boston Coolers (basically a ginger ale ice cream float)
5. Saganaki is always a bonus (OPPA!)

Cheers to all my fellow coney  connoisseurs![deleted]I just talked to the owner of this restaurant for a news story about this. What a sweet man! He told me that he lived on a farm in Greece with seven brothers and sisters, and his parents couldn't afford to send him to school. He left home when he was 12 and went to Athens, where he was homeless, and depended on the kindness of others to give him food. He said he does this every year because ""It makes my heart feel good to do it, and help a little bit."" This has to be metro Detroit. Not aware of any other place on earth with Coneys. [deleted]This guy understands real life. Good job Coney Island guy.**#Coney2015**""...my local Coney Island""?

As a New Yorker, this is confusing. That's really nice and all. But I am a national Coney Island man. Give me a hani and cheese fries as my last meal. And the answer to the big question is Lafayette. I'm thinking of going... I have no kitchen and everyone else is working that day.I need this where I live. Hate getting whatever fast food is open and being ""that"" guy.If I can marry this restaurant I would in a heartbeat!Sounds better than spending it with my familyThe worst part of leaving the Detroit area was giving up coney islands.Holy shit I miss Coney Island, didn't realize how much until I saw this.

I wanted to make something like this for my turtle.
second- as a turtle owner, I can't express strongly enough.. DON'T GET RED EARED SLIDERS.  My turtle outgrew her tanks super fast, and finally even a 55 gallon wasn't big enough.  Also, they are so dirty that you really need to invest in a very good filtration system.

I have 2 of them now, both are rescues (from other owners) and you can't return them to the wild.  One is the size of a dinner plate.

Btw,  I am fairly certain those turtles are happy. They can go from wet to dry and get fed regularly.  Damn u, turtles.Yours is probably easier to clean. And I'm guessing that the probability that you would poop on your couch, bed, or in your food is pretty low.

You're the clear winner, here. What with not pooping in your own food.My parents have 3 turtles. The tank's water would constanly get dirty (Granted, our tank was way too small for 3 turtles of their sizes...). Nowadays, we just leave the turtle walking around the house and drop them into water for half the day (but they almost always stay inside the room (we've put them in a small room)Ex turtle owner,  turtles are a complete pain the the ass,  they do not know how to stop eating,  so people continue to feed them,  and they will soon grow out of their enclosure. 

You can feed them on normal intervals at a healthy rate,  but they will beg 24/7 when  they see you.  They  eat their own shit,  destroy the tank water if you feed them live food,  will eat your feeders/helpers. 

They are not sociable,  and will freak you the fuck out each time you pass the living room as they dive bomb the tank thinking you are a predator. 

They require special lighting/bulbs that will heat your house and cost you money,  you also have to build a dry spot for them...  Yes this one is fancy and I guarantee you they will NOT ever touch the sand,  as it's out of their comfort zone,  one inch stacked on ledge is probably as far as they go. 

If you have the right size tank 40-55 gal at this size and have the top off,  your house will become humid,  after this size the only humane options is outside and that depends on your Temps. 

After a few years most end up in the canals or lakes...  Mine ended up on Craigs list.  I will Never have turtles again. As a turtle owner, and knowing the cost of the equipment, that turtle residence cost more to maintain than my house This kills me. Someone spent quite a bit of money and time building this. Teak ramps and platforms, top notch water filtration. Even the sand is clean. It is an amazing terrarium.

Why cheapen the whole thing with a 10 dollar clamp light?How the hell do you even start to clean that tank.It's so good you could almost post it on r/roompornI disagree. Your apartment has a front door you can walk out of. Not many people know this, but turtles are nature's suction cups.It's sweet someone went all out making a cool home for them.*These turtles have their basic biological requirements met, for once!*

FTFY


In this thread: people who think turtles are bad pets because they do not know how to take care of them. Stealing the top post of all time from r/aquariums and posting it to r/pics for more karma? That's a paddling.I wonder how much the rent is...I like turtleCan you custom build tanks like this as a DIY project?  I bet the turtles would swap if you asked them.But can they do this?

Edit: Unrelated thought -- I think, if one were to beat up an asshole bad enough that it looked like Fordite, that they ought to say something to the effect of ""look upon my works, and despair!""Kinda reminds me of this chunk taken off a wall of graffiti in LA

[That sea foam green]( http://i.imgur.com/o8zVBPjh.jpg)Also known as Fordite or Detroit agate.Were do I get oneThis is what my lungs look like from working in a body shop paint area for 25 years. In Michigan we call it Fordite. It's actually somewhat valuable in the lapidary worldReminds me of that Malcolm in the Middle episode with the wall of paintThere's a YouTuber who does something similar too but I can't think who, he's a woodworker but his friend of dad or maybe he worked in a car plant and would clean up the paint every few years and turn them on his lathe. Polished car paint over ground beef! YUM!oh man, the lead....so much lead...I'm confused as to what the object is. Is it a piece of a wall where overspray hit?I've seen these chunks of paint personally at different automotive plants. 

When a car body is going through the paint shop in an automotive plant it is riding on a dolly that will carry it from the beginning to the end of the paint shop. So after going through the paint shop the car body is removed from the dolly and the dolly goes back to the beginning to get another car body placed and ready to paint. Each time a car body is painted there is overspray that lands on the dolly. After going through the shop many many times without ever being cleaned it tends to build up in large chunks of dried paint. Not sure how many times it takes to build up like this. My guess is a year or so. 

I never thought to cut one up and polish I though. Usually just scraped it off. I met a knifemaker in rural Alaska (99.999% of Alaska), who would make knife handles out of this stuff.  The advent of two stage paint put a limit on his supply as lacquer was his main source. 

That was years ago, anyone know who I'm talking about?  He still around?

Edit: took me a little while, but I found him. Virgil at IRBI Knives in Seward, AK. I was there back in 1994 or so, glad to see they're still going. It would appear that they no longer use the lacquer, though.

Anyway, for those interested:

http://www.irbiknives.comI heard that this is actually running for a good chunk of money for jewelers nowActually called Fordite or [Detroid Agate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordite)This is one of those pictures that makes me feel uncomfortable inside.

Edit: Son of a bitch. I just learned about Trypophobia and I have it. Thanks Reddit.This is called Fordite or Detroit Agate.

It's basically leftovers from old car factories. The paint that goes on the cars builds up on other equipment over the years, you scrape that paint off say... a shelf, polish it down, and this it what you get.What is that?
  
Christine's tracking implant. She clawed it out.
  
How would it know to do that?
  
She remembered where they put it in.This is what my engagement ring is made of!This reminds me of a study that was done a few years ago analyzing vehicle paint chips scraped from the bodies of dead crows.  A load of dead crows had been spotted dead at the road side of a particular highway just near an overpass. After analyzing the paint samples from the beaks of the birds a team of scientists determined that all of them had been killed because of impacts caused only by trucks. To investigate they setup a camera on the overpass and noticed very quickly that when one bird is feeding on the ground below another bird will act as lookout up top. The problem was that the bird below was always hit by a truck because the lookout bird...

Slovenia on the first page. That's a new one.[deleted]IRL Scholomance. Bled is a beautiful place. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/gatMtdM.jpg) is a photo I took there a few years back on a stunning January morning. Its the best photo I've ever taken. Upvotes for beautiful Slovenia! I lived in Slovenia for over a year - Lake Bled was gorgeous every season! 

Edit: OP should mention [Blejske Kremne Rezine] (http://www.alexwilltravel.com/blog/2011/11/23/lake-bled-cream-cake-tuesday-foodday.html) when mentioning Lake Bled; delicious and nothing else like it, it's worth a trip to Bled by itself!Yes! Slovenia on the front page! We are fucking famous!Story time!! I took the girlfriend there while on vacation. There's a local tradition that grooms carry thier brides up the 99 steps to the chaple to get married. So being a badass, once we tied up the row boat, I proceded to carry her up the stairs, counting each step. Once we reached the top I thought it was odd that I didn't quite get to 99. Ah well, I'm tired, maybe I missed a few... so we walk over to the other side of the island where the real steps were. Doh! The girlfriend was kinda sad, but then I agreed to walk down and carry her up the real steps to make it official. Lots of tourist were taking pictures and cheering us on. Thats my Bled story!#

#bobrossFuck yeah! Love it when Slovenia gets noticed. One of the most underrated countries in Europe!

ps: first post. sweet.One side of my family is originally from Bled. I was there recently and had the chance to discover over thousands of years worth of both family history, and history of Bled. There is so much interesting history from medieval castles to a dictator's palace! There really is an attraction for anyone, whether you enjoy history, adventure, nature, or just old town European charm! I would strongly recommend this friendly town to everyone who is planning to travel to Europe. oi fam where we goin tonite?

 That job, the making of the buildings of Tipoca city, was a super fun and difficult job. Maybe one of the best teams of modelmakers I know of: John Duncan, John Goodson, Tory Bellici, Dave Fogler. Supervised by Brian Gernand.
 The big hero building I'm working on there was a mad 3 week dash to finish (just the modelmaking- the painters then had a couple weeks to paint all the buildings).  IN fact you can see details from my model there all over the Obiwan/Jango fight scene on the landing platform. They used my model as background for that whole scene. Awesome seeing my work blown up (and holding it's scale) across a big movie screen. Still gives me chills. I had a rough sketch to work from but got to make up all the detailing as I saw fit.

These types of photos are taken by photographers after the props are completed and they just have the model makers pretend to work on them.Apparently Adam got less gingery as he aged.I often forget that Adam, Jamie and M5 are active in film and TV outside of Mythbusters.Tori was probably my favorite of the B team. What is he doing now?Adam talked about these types of pictures on the Tested podcast. ""Just pose... Pretend like you're doing something special effectsy.""Is that a fucking chain wallet Adam?Actually these are their clones--the originals were doing Jamie's laundry.What's tori up to these days?  As much as I'm sorry they got the boot, I'm really liking the new mythbusters format.  Much more time devoted to the building and problem solving.

I don't live in Tianjin so I don't know what happened there. I probably never will because the government controls the media.

They will cover it up with how selfless the firefighters were and how the innocent people sacrificed themselves for the country. 

Just like they did when a ship sank with casualties a few months ago. They will spin it until it sounds like they are happy it happened so the local government could look good. So I saw this guy.

So this happened at work.

So I came home to this.

Because a decrease in entropy requires spending of energy, and people don't like spending energy, it's easier to increase the amount of entropy somewhere else. Like a drawer.

[deleted]Hah, wow! I've actually been exposed to this book before.

Years and years ago, I went on a few dates with a young woman who believed that absolutely every problem in the world could be attributed to our diets. She was of the opinion that humans were meant to eat a very specific variety of foods... and the only thing that *she* ever ate was rice and fish.

As one might expect, we went out for sushi every time that we got together.

When I eventually asked if the young woman had any scientific evidence to back up her claims - and remember, she thought that *every problem in the world* could be attributed to eating the wrong things - she cited an old book with that photograph in it.

""See?"" she said to me. ""As soon as they started eating the wrong things, their teeth got crooked and started rotting. They became violent, and their intelligence levels dropped.""

I was unconvinced. ""I don't see how eating a hamburger could lead to nuclear war.""

The girl was prepared for my skepticism. She listed off a long (and unlikely) series of changes and events, which had apparently been dictated to her by someone who had started his own little New Age cult of sorts... and the book from which this picture came was essentially a piece of religious text for them. To hear the young woman tell it, the only way to solve the problems in the world - everything from poverty to disease to daytime television - was to have everyone change their collective diets.

If I was interested, I was told, I could attend one of the ""Dietary Coaching"" seminars.

There weren't any more dates after that.

**TL;DR: This image was used in an effort to make me join a cult.**What types of foods did the natives eat?I'm a dentist and as I read the comments it is very similar as to why animals don't get caries/cavities.....NO SUGAR. RDH here. This kind of thing comes up a lot on reddit about diet and caries. So, it sounds like people have already chimed in that this particular work is a bit biased/suspect, but I would like to give some information about the reality around this kind of issue.       
Over and over again I hear people claiming that non-modern humans (pick your time period) had perfect dental health. Usually this is cited to support an idea that a particular diet (pick one) will eliminate caries in modern humans and that we can all throw away our toothbrushes. Though there are some important kernels of truth here, this is a huge oversimplification at best and at worst, based on things that are simply not true.      
First off, you can find plenty of archeological evidence that people have been having cavities and infected teeth and gums forever. Heck, I saw a parish register in a plague villiage that listed teeth regularly as a cause of death. All fermentable carbohydrates cause cavities, so I would expect to see them in populations that eat any kind of grain, fruit, or vegetables, even without any access to modern processed foods.       
Now, all carbs cause cavities, but you get a lot more cavities with more frequent and longer exposure. So modern snacking and sipping increases the rate. As does the availability of carbs that stick to the teeth, like processed foods. However, even ancient cultures have some sticky foods like honey and dried fruit. So, what does this mean? Everything else being equal, someone with an ancient, 'whole food' kind of diet (assuming it isn't mostly honey and dried fruit, I'm sure not all diets were equal)is going to have fewer cavities over the same lifespan than someone who eats Western junk food all day. However, they will likely be far from having perfect teeth by our modern standard. Having some blackened, half rotted teeth would be a common enough thing in adults, and often survivable, but not exactly what I think the modern human wants.Isn't the point that today's typical ""white""/""American"" diet is so high in sugar that cavities are inevitable, regardless of brushing habits? Whereas a diet of whole, minimally processed foods will typically lead to better dental health?Meth doesn't count as food.Define ""white man's food.""  What is their native diet?Ever eaten bush tucker? It sucks. All witchetty grubs and bark and shit. It has to do with diet, not to do with how 'primitive' the culture is. 

Archaeologists dont use the word primitive for that reason, not only is it insulting and dumb, but we don't really know enough about 'primitive' cultures to call ourselves enlightened on the subject. 

There are cultures around the world who literally grind their teeth away because they cut meat with their teeth. Some modern cultures do this too, and we have records of people fucking up their teeth going back thousands of years. 

Again, it has nothing to do with how 'primitive' they are, but more to do with what they eat, and just as importantly, how certain cultures eat their food. I always thought it was weird humans all of a sudden had to brush their teeth or face decay and toothloss.One of the things I learned while back-packing in South America is not to bring candies as ""presents"" for the natives. In particular to their children. Unless you have access to daily dental care it can be terribly detrimental to their teeth and ultimately their health.People don't realise white sugar and sweets aren't found in nature.*TL;DR:* There are several zillion reasons to avoid refined sugar and foods that are high in sugar.Yeah but I bet it tastes better.White people also use tooth brushes... You can trace the spread of corn through North America by looking at the skeletons of ancient people; the high amount of carbohydrates in corn led to a much higher increase of cavities, due to enzymes in the mouth breaking down the plentiful carbohydrates in corn into sugar.Well yeah. Sugar and carbohydrates are pretty bad for dental health. I bet the aboriginals did not eat many grains, fruits, or any other carb rich food.Have a feeling their diet consists of little to no sugar and carbs. Refined sugar + lack of dental care.I have no source for it, but I remember watching a documentary. They found in ancient human's skulls that these early humans used to have reasonably healthy teeth until some point, when they started settling, and growing weeds, and producing porridge like foods out of it. When that happened there was a huge increase in dental problems.My grandmother was a peasant farmer in the former Yugoslavia. 
She would clean her teeth with charcoal from the previous nights fire.
My mother would say her teeth would always be white.
She died at 92 with all her original teeth.In an anthro course I took several years back, the professor explained that archaeological records show a correlation between dental decay and diet. He said that nomadic hunter-gatherers had healthy teeth because their diets were high in fruits and meat. It wasn't until people started doing agriculture that we began getting dental caries. This was when our diets began to contain a lot more simple sugars, which are the primary food source for the bacteria that cause dental caries.

Edit: Sorry I don't have the answers, it's a photo taken by a parent and was made viral in my country. I have a feeling I am going to be pissed off a lot when I have kids in grade school.

That said, her way is stupid.Okay people who say ""but groups matter!"" They don't. Not in conventional math. You don't even have to know what the numbers are to complete these problems. Its an issue of a teacher forcing his or her dumb way. It's not an issue of the child not knowing how to group things in order, because according to their grade they aced the word problems on the test. To me they also aced the conventional problems as well. Since when was adding by 3's to achieve a number faster and easier than by 5's? So now you just took a kid who was doing well at math, confused them, and turned them off of it with your continuous nit picking of shit that doesn't matter. This reminds me of high school chemistry. When we were doing stoichiometry, my teacher required us to use the ""proper"" form where you use conversion factors and can visualize the units canceling. I liked to do them using an algebraic approach which was faster for me and I would end up with the same answer. So come time for the test, I ended up getting a 42% just because I didn't do it her way. This stuff drives me insane. If something works for a student, just let them do it that way. Fuck this way of teachingHow are people actually debating this? 

The teacher is wrong and really bad at creative thinking, meaning a bad teacher. I kind of see this as an entirely mathematically illiterate person teaching 3rd grade and following an answer sheet without thinking.[commutativity of multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property#Commutative_operations_in_mathematics)Maybe the teacher wanted it both ways and said so before the quiz but some student didn't listen!

He walked around the house smoking weed in a regular tobacco pipe like you'd put store bought tobacco in all the time.  I'm pretty sure the man was even high in his sleep.

I asked him several times how he afforded to smoke so much pot and where did he get it since he never went out and no one came over and he didn't work. In fact it drove me crazy to figure it out and I in turn drove him crazy asking.

He finally said he'd show me but I'd better never say a word.  He took me up in the attic and he was growing his own.

My granny's house was a huge old servant's quarters that sat off from the big house so the attic was really what had been like a dormitory where they slept.

The entire thing was full of plants in different sizes and states of drying.  Lights, a watering system, all sorts of things for growing plants. 

 All in neat raised troughs he'd built which were full off stones instead of soil.  I can't remember why he said that was a better way to grow it.

I was stunned.  

He actually was a genius, but he also was a weirdo.  Never worked a day and lived with granny until she died.

I also remember everyone screaming at him one night because the FBI had come over looking for him and asking questions.

Seems he was printing some sort of newspaper against the government and the Vietnam war then plastering copies all over.

Actually, that's when I learned about Freedom of Speech  and the Bill of Rights.

Haven't seen or heard of him in almost forty years.  If he's still alive, he's probably high, laying in the bed with that pipe, and screaming at the anchors on FOX news.A few years ago there was [this story](http://www.flyingmag.com/news/pilot-makes-boeing-737-flight-simulator-out-old-airliner) of a guy who spent $150K and 8 years building a flight simulator into a real 737 cockpit.  Would've been cheaper to get a commercial pilot's license and rating to fly a real 737 -_-That's commitment there, my friend. I want to sit in it and listen to Cabin Pressure.

Some apes can have social staring where it need not be a threat display and often used after conflict to reconcile. 

Basically that monkey might be there all day if it feels dominant over the teddy, if it breaks the gaze it will be subordinate to your bear.

He commented:

> This isn't ridiculous at all. This is a far more honest and realistic advertisement than today's propoganda. Advertising that you provide, say, the energy of an atomic bomb every year is not the same as saying that you drop an atomic bomb every year. The fact that we would see this as WTF seems to say more about how we as an audience don't understand this advertisement than it does about the ad itself.
This is simply a measure of energy required to melt a given capacity of ice.. It's what? a grade 11 chemistry problem? I'd take this kind of advertisement over:

I'm being entirely serious, btw. He's not the best thing because he'd be the best president, or because he has good ideas, or because he is elevating political debate, but he is clear, incontrovertible evidence to anyone who isn't crazy that something is desperately wrong and has been for a long time.The main thing Trump has going for him is that he's not a politician.  That shows you how untrustworthy politicians have become in 2015.  Not that they haven't been for a long time, but it's way more out in the open nowadays.  The fact that this dude has a real shot at president after some of the shit he has said tells you all you need to know.  

You can call people stupid and act like you're better than them all you want.  But to me Trump isn't the problem, it's years of career politicians being corrupt as fuck that's the problem.  It's the reason Trump can get away with all of the shit in his past and present.  Not everyone who supports Trump is a moron, some are just willing to give the guy investing his own money a shot.  As ridiculous as it sounds, he's similar to Obama coming after Bush in that way.

When i was younger i worked for a little while at a pizza place. I didnt touch the pizza but when school let out, all the kids came in for italian ices that you scoop into little cups. I was supposed to man the ice counter. 
Everythings going fine until i got some cherry flavored onto the scoop and it kinda splattered around. no big deal. who doesnt like cherry anyway? 
I serve like 20-25 people. Finally someone says 'hey is that blood?"" when i handed him his lemon flavored ice. I said "" 'no thats just some cherry in there""

turns out i had cut myself and had served my blood to everyone for nearly an hour. 

sorry guys!""You mean you didn't order the dodecahedron crust?""About 8 years ago, I was living in this apartment on a street that was sort of easy to miss. I order a pizza and they say it will be there in an hour. An hour and a half goes by and I get a call from the delivery driver, he says he thinks he went too far down this one road and wants to know how to get to my place. He was 4 towns over and 15 miles away when I looked at MapQuest. 

I politely called the pizza place and canceled the order. They apologized profusely, said they would give me a credit and next time the order was free. So I head to McDonalds to get something to eat. The delivery guy gets to my place about the same time I was getting back, which is now 2 hours after I ordered the pizza and 80 minutes since he left he place to deliver it. He demands I pay him the $26 for the order. I told him I already cancelled it and spoke to his restaurant, which he then proceeded to go apeshit asking me why I would do such a thing. This was going to be the last straw and he was going to be fired, it was all my fault for ratting him out. He fired the pizza at me and left. 

I took the pizza inside, since why not, right? No point in letting it go to waste. Even with him throwing it at me and the box tumbling multiple times, it still looked better than the one you have displayed there. What the hell did your guy do to it and how the hell didn't he know it was a mangled mess?

Edit some quick changes.When I first started a pizza job nothing was explained about how to actually deliver the pizzas and so I was pretty nervous. I saw other pizza guys carrying the thermal bags sideways, so I thought that was how we carried them (I now know those were probably empty...). 

My first delivery must have been mush, and then when they reordered because of the (obviously) terrible pizza I was the one who ended up taking the remake. Nobody had told me why the first pizza wasn't good, so when the customer opened the second one in front of me and screamed in my face I was super confused why the magic gravity defying bags hadn't worked. Yikes. This is a projection of a pizza originally from R^5 down into R^3 space. 

Your delivery man was an time traveling, dimension-hopping, plane-consuming hellbeast who has little regard for the gentle suggestions that we call ""laws of physics."" 30 minutes or less or more, it is immaterial to him. A pizza is a flat circle... to the eyes of an ape. The wisest men would argue that time and pizza are both flat circles. But the truth is that a pizza is a universe, eternal and unbounded and tortuous. The deliverer can perceive all ends. As he was, so he will be. As you consumed universes, so he will consume yours. Look upon his work, and despair.Double pepo pizza. It's for a cop.Fucking SpidermanEx-delivery driver here, I've had pizzas fall of the stack and get wedged between my car door and the seat, and they still looked fine. Pizza boxes are amazing at keeping pizza intact.

I don't know what the fuck happened here, it probably got stuck to the screen in the oven and the insider scraped it up and threw it in the box. Knowing managers, the delivery guy probably had no clue.Put that shit in a blender and serve it to me in a dirty coffee mug, I'll still drink it. I don't give a fuck manSo 1 time - iowa city:

Ordered a med pizza for me, some pasta thing for the gf.

pizza and pasta come, though there is no sauce on the pasta, just noodles. dafuq?

So i call them, and they tell us they will come and replace it. 40 mins go by, and I hear a knock at the door. The pizza guy is standing there with a fresh pizza. not pasta. I explain to him, that the gf really wanted the pasta, no worries he brought the wrong thing, can he just come back with the pasta.

So, another half hour or so goes by, and i hear a car door outside. I head downstairs to see the pizza guy just standing in my screened in-carpeted front porch. Just shaking his head.  I go to open the door, and he yells at me - ""No! stop!""  

Now, im like, ok dude, you cant tell me not to open my own door.

When i do, i immediately look down and see this red pasta explosion all over my door, and carpet. He must of dropped the pasta when going to knock on the door.  I felt so bad for the guy. He and I both just sat down on the lawn chairs. I laughed and cracked a beer for him. His worst day ever.A breadtangle of pizza.http://i.imgur.com/o7xQbnm.gifvDamn... there's just one big, mushy piece.

What will the others eat?Looks like you ordered the [pizza with White sauce](http://i.imgur.com/L5tdFeJ.gif)Former pizza delivery driver here.  Looks like he picked up the box sideways while the pizza was still very hot.  I saw new drivers do this all the time.  He probably had no idea what he did.  That, or he didn't give a shit.  You see that a lot too. About 15 years ago I was training in a new delivery driver. This consisted of me sitting in his passenger seat giving him directions and occasionally going to the door to check out his interactions.   Well we get to the shop and they tell me we were out of normal pizza boxes so using back up boxes that didn't have our logo on top.   I didn't think twice about it. New guy however gets halfway to the door on our next delivery, doesn't see the logo, panics, flips the box over, quickly realizes his mistake and flips it over again. Reminded me of this pizza instantly. Who says the delivery guy even looked in the box? I'd say he just delivers them. As a pizza boy I feel the need to chime in.

Sometimes shit happens.

We aren't trying to fuck with you.

Honestly I just want to go home.

I'm sorry.He concentrated it for youHe probably didn't know, honestly. Its really easy to fuck up a pizza, and he's probably in a hurry. Just call the store and claim your free pizza.Okay, here's another more realistic scenario... OP is high as fuck...pizza dude comes to the door and hands OP the pizza...OP puts the pizza vertically under his arm to hold it while he finds cash in his pockets to pay for it...Pizza guy says, ""careful with that"", Op says..'what man?""....OP then shuts the door....goes to eat pizza and says, ""hey what the fuck happened to my pizza? That fucking pizza guy is a douche"". He french fried when he should've pizza'd.

Churches were bar none the worst offenders for not paying / trying to get out of bills. 

One extremely large baptist church in the area had ducked the bill on a new server install / domain migration / file server migration for several months. They actually had the gall to call us to replace the batteries on one of their UPS's. The call was sent from support.. to billing.. to the owner of the company.. .. he agreed to the work. 

We both showed up on site and he powered off the server they never paid for (Their only domain controller aka the thing that holds all the network user accounts and lets people login) and started packing it up. The head pastor showed up after we already had the machine boxed up and started screaming at us when he realized what we had done.. and called the police.. and blocked us from leaving.

The cops showed up, and as expected the pastor accuses us of theft. My boss pulls out a signed copy of the contract and shows the officer the date it was signed (several months prior) and the spot in the contract that essentially says any unpaid equipment will be repossessed 60 days after payment is due. The officer says basically says there's nothing he can do and leaves.. They cut a check for the full amount due on the invoice plus late fee's on the spot... They asked us to put the server back in place and my boss laughed and said an 'emergency server install will cost 1000 payment upfront....' they cut us another check.. It was one of the most ballsy thing I've ever seen..

edit; Damn this got big.. A few people asked what a church needs servers for. This wasn't your run of the mill neighborhood church, they had several pastors, dozens of staff members \ offices, 1000+ members is a safe bet, a ridiculous number rooms for preschool \ daycare, and around 50-75 computers across the multi acre \ multi building campus.. you could get lost in the place.. and I did .. a few times.

As far as my boss.. he was a huge asshole and absolutely LIVED for situations like this to come up. You could visibly see him get excited when he had an opportunity to put someone in their place. > 14 Do not take advantage of a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether that worker is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in one of your towns. 15 Pay them their wages each day before sunset, because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise they may cry to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.

Deuteronomy 24:14-15

> Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.

James 5:4I've had a pastor come in and buy some 400 amp main service panels from donation of a member   The member came in and paid.  Fast forward 3 months and the church returns one, but because the member who donated the money ""moved away"", I was told by management to reimburse them on their personal card.  Fast forward another 6 months and the second panel came back.  this church pastor successfully conned a member of $1700 and I could do nothing about it.  Yup! My local Salvation Army Church racked up an $800+ bill at my family's small business, thanked us for our excellent service, gave us a business card with a bible verse, said they'd mail a check, and... that's it. Won't return calls, won't respond to letters, clearly no intent to pay. Screw them. I can't wait to try not to flip out every time I see the kettle ringers this year. Bastards.  

*Edit: Many of you are suggesting suing/going to the police (an approach I support), but I am outranked by those who feel the damage WE'D suffer in the court of public opinion wouldn't be worth the money. This is a small town, very conservative, and a lot of our customers have strong affiliations with churches. The fear is that by becoming ""the people that sued that little local church,"" we risk angering/alienating local people and doing greater than $800+ worth of damage to our existing client list and future business opportunities. The risk is real, as much as I'd like to ignore it. So, no lawsuit for now. We are, however, letting the story leak out to all sympathetic ears and letting local gossip do its thing and hoping that we get to a point where public sentiment is in favor of us suing the church.*That's why I follow Our Lady of Perpetual ExemptionEither this picture is old or that Saab's tags are extremely out of date. Expired in 2013.I worked for a church marketing / website design company for 7 years. During that time, I learned that many church administrations are filled with some of the most deceitful, dishonest, and abusive people on the planet. The following practices were pretty standard fare:

* Non-payment without providing justification
* Demanding free additional work/features (""because we're a church we shouldn't have to pay"")
* Ignoring project milestones / deadlines and lying to cover up the church's non-compliance.
* Verbally abusing employees

As a result of this clusterfucked period in my life, my faith is pretty much non-existent and I haven't been inside a church for at least 5 years. If you ever have the misfortune of working with a church, I highly recommend getting paid up front and preparing yourself for a lot of anguish and misery.My wife used to work at a stained glass restoration shop. Obviously churches are their most common customers, and it is *incredibly* hard for them to get paid. [deleted]Few years ago I passed by a house, painted across the front in big black letters read something like ""refuses to pay the painters"". [deleted]Send In A Prayer Request!

http://imgur.com/0AZuYzFI worked for a advertising firm. There were many persons that would attempt to get preferential treatment or discounts by claiming to be a church or preacher/pastor. When we told them that we do not offer such discounts, there demeanor flipped. They would tell us things such as ""You're going to hell"" or ""Your company lacks morals"". Persons/organizations, under a religious classification, that would contract us for work would often make claims that they could not pay for services rendered and that we could sue them in a court. Additionally, they would follow up said claims with statements like ""No court will choose you over a church"". The courts always sided with the business. This standard of behavior lead to a policy which we refused business from any religious organizations. I find this to be a very prudent policy. Worked as a delivery driver throughout most of college. Hated deliveries to church even more than the trips to the dangerous part of town. At least there was a chance of an insulting tip in the dangerous part of town. The churches seemed to think I was delivering for Jesus.Should have taken William Burroughs advice: 
If you're doing business with a religious son of a bitch, get it in writing; his word isn't worth shit, not with the good Lord telling him how to fuck you on the deal.Years ago I worked at a small repair shop. This man would come in to pick up things he had dropped off for repair and say ""God will bless you"" and walk out. I did not run the shop at that time. But owner got sick and let me take over while he got better. This man came in that tried the crap with me. I told him that god did not pay my bills and until he paid his the stuff stayed where it was. At first it looked like a sign on the side of that road.  After looking some more I can see that it is in the bed of the truck.Really hate seeing stuff like this. I'm the director of a church and handle all the financials. I tip and overpay our contractors and vendors. The church should be the place that all businesses ""should"" want to work with. Instead churches like this make the rest of us look like assholes.Sold phone systems and cabling years ago, yes churches were the worst about not paying followed by lawyers.I work for a construction company in Texas.

>The Enouy revolver was a design patented by Joseph Enouy of Middlesex, England, who received British patent #1359 in 1855. The basic revolver was based on a transitional revolver design made by Charles Osborne in 1845. The innovative part of Enouy's design was the compound magazine design. In this particular example, each revolver cylinder is capable of holding 6 shots and there are 8 different revolver cylinders attached to the compound magazine wheel, thereby giving this weapon a capacity of 48 shots. 

>As you may have guessed, this weapon is very heavy, unbalanced and unwieldy at the same time. Due to the magazine wheel in front, the user can't carry this revolver is his pocket or in a holster either. This firearm design was not a success and Joseph Enouy didn't seem to manufacture many of them either. In fact, most of the pictures of this firearm available on the web are from one particular revolver made by Enouy, which was once owned by a Mr. Vokes. As there are no records of this revolver being manufactured and sold commercially, it is possible that the above example is literally the only one that was ever made. It is fortunate that we have a record of Mr. Enouy's patent application available.

He grew up in a little town during the Depression.  One year things were so bad, he and his family had nothing to eat but sweet potatoes for a month and a half.

For a few of the guys in his platoon, it was the first time the had SEEN indoor plumbing.There's a million halloween posts today.  And you take the road less traveled and post an actual interesting picture that has nothing to do with the holiday.

You know what OP?  You're alright.I've been lucky enough to have the same feeling as this guy, Versailles is an intensely beautiful place. Central and northern France has some of the most beautiful scenery and best culture around. As an American from the south I really fell in love with it. I like this this place.

Village? Really? Visiting Versailles - that is the hall of mirrors which looks nothing like what you imagine. The rooms and bed are smaller than I had imagined but the gardens and grounds are bigger.

You can see more of ~~his~~ her work here http://sannadullaway.com/American here.  I would like to respond to quite a few negative responses to this post from ""Americans.""
I did a Google image search to find out information on the original photo. From the Library of Congress website:    

[A Yank in Versailles](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2007675050/)    
Summary: Photograph shows Pvt. Gordon Conrey of Milford, N.H., one of the first Americans to visit Versailles after its liberation, standing in the hall of mirrors.    

The original, as presented at the LOC, is black and white so this photo was probably colorized.  That is not unusual for WWII photos.  There are quite a few [colorized American Civil War photos](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2446391/Amazing-Civil-War-photographs-created-colorist-bring-eras-heroes-characters-life-color-time.html) as well.  What is the problem with it being in color?    

For those of you who say that the U.S. does not have villages, [you might let the U.S. Census Bureau know.](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/understandingplace.pdf)  The U.S. does have villages. It also has boroughs.  What you call a community depends on where you are.  ""Town"" is probably the most used term for a small community, but not exclusively so.  Yes, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milford,_New_Hampshire) Milford, N.H. is called a town.  But it is not unreasonable, for its size, to call it a village.  I doubt if many of the residents there would feel insulted by the label.    
This post was good post.  It was respectful of the American soldier.  As an American, I am embarrassed and disgusted by the negative responses it has received from ""Americans.""","{'Sadness': 0.048246, 'Emotional_Range': 0.612, 'Tentative': 0.241, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.04286, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.275, 'Agreeableness': 0.585, 'Joy': 0.059671, 'Disgust': 0.048092, 'Extraversion': 0.521, 'Openness': 0.448, 'Anger': 0.556075}","{'architecture': 0.268941, 'palace': 0.5, 'room': 0.331812}"

First top hat creates an enormous stir

""In January 1797, a certain Hetherington appeared in the streets of London. The hat maker walked along the thoroughfare wearing a top hat in the shape of a stovepipe. Within a short time, a large crowd had gathered around him. There was such chaos that the 'officer of the law' grabbed Hetherington by the collar and summonsed him before the court. He was accused of disturbing public order.""

The officer, who dealt with the scandal, described the offence as follows: ""Hetherington had such a tall and shiny construction on his head that it must have terrified nervous people. The sight of this construction was so overstated that various women fainted, children began to cry and dogs started to bark. One child broke his arm among all the jostling.""NOW YOU FUCKED UP. NOW YOU FUCKED UP.Sheeeeesssssh.....  I've got to have it restored, put it in a case.  It's not like someone comes in here every day asking for Lincoln's hat that he was shot in.  Best I can do is $350.I was very young when I saw this on tour at the Huntington Library, but still remember two small facts.   
Lincoln kept his notes for a current speech in his hat. It is lined with beaver fur, and there is a distinct faded fingerprint on the brim from where Lincoln would tip his hat constantly as he passed through crowds.  I wonder what causes the ""aging"" of the hat. Is it light? Moisture? Being handled? I'm always curious as to how these things break down. Weird.

I think I drove on these beaches in Mario Kart.I just see a bunch of amazing climbing possibilities. The Silent CartographerCan confirm this is Na Pali coast as I took the open door heli tour in June.   It is an amazing sight from both the air and boat.   I checked to confirm this wasn't my pic as I have some on my Flickr account very similar.   I highly recommend a visit to Kauai!

>It started while Kaszlikowski was shooting the upcoming documentary K2 Touching the Sky. He wanted a personal project to occupy his downtime during the weeks-long filming schedule, so he sent his DJI Phantom on a recon mission to scout shooting locations. The drone scoped out places around Concordia, the area below K2 where the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers converge. Kaszlikowski spotted a section of glacier that was melting away, creating a dramatic clone-like structure and a picturesque miniature river.

>“The place was special, making a very clean graphic frame,” he says. “It was disappearing, melting, changing its form every day. It was quite obvious nobody will photograph it again like me; nobody will see it the same way the next season.”

Here's a summary on the shot and the [article](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/david-kaszlikowski-k2-glacier/)Higher resolution mirror wallpaper [Link](https://i2.wp.com/www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/033.jpg) (2200 x 1352)Looks like where you'd find an Ice-Type Legendary.This clears up some issues of what why it looks like that: 

*The Polish photographer and a guide trekked to the spot at night to create a strange but vivid image that looks like it might be an alien planet. He used a 30-second exposure shot with a Canon 5D Mark III on a tripod. While the shutter was open, he “painted” the water and surrounding area with an LED, creating an eerie glow on the ice and sky. Although he was there during the summer, the temperature still drops to a frosty 5 degrees Fahrenheit up there at 16,000 feet, so his hands were plenty cold while working.*

*The final image plays tricks with size and scale, and the foreground doesn’t provide many clues. Although the bend in the river is 65 feet wide, the mountains in the background are some of the highest in the world. The region includes K2, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum I and II—all of them topping 26,000 feet.*Needs a Yeti.I'm going to need a gold Chocobo.Looks like the pool with the moon spirits in the northern water tribe in avatarThe boundaries between reality and sci-fi are now blurred more than everI'd love to check out what kind of rocks are in there. i thought it was a 3d model at firstAnd then [these motherfuckers](https://i.imgur.com/kogRcW0.jpg) trod everywhere through it.This was not* a ""drone"", it was an rc helicopter (or [radio controlled multirotor helicopter](http://www.dji.com/product/phantom) ).

That's a bowl of rocky mint chocolate chip HagenDaas in front of a picture of stars and mountains. What is making drones so ubiquitous now that wasn't present 10 years ago?

Those are sequences of sandstone, shale, and some limestone.  Shales are only deposited in deep oceans while sandstones are deposited near shore.  Limestones are deposited only in shallow marine waters.  You may ask, then why does the sequel switch or repeat? Well, that is due to transgressive and regressive sequences (Basically changes in sea level). The more resistant and white rock is likely limestone while the thinner beds of dark rock that seem more eroded are shale and there is certainly some sandstone in there too.  Every change in lithology (rock type) is representative of a change in sea level, up or down.  These see level changes are generally caused by glaciation events and plate tectonics.  This section may also be affected by isostatic rebound which is when a heavy weight is removed from the land so ""floats"" up to equilibrium.  The weight in this instance would be a mile thick glacier or ice sheet which is obviously no longer here.  I will gladly answer any questions.Almost 6,000 years of geological history right there!

It looks like you could fit a whole Zelda dungeon in that thing!Things like this are probably one reason why modern geology started off in that area (late 1700s/James Hutton), at first to try and prove the Biblical Flood record, but eventually the conflicting data found couldn't be ignored, as it showed magnitudes of difference in age. It was a tough choice, tossing out a long accepted book's history for some painfully obvious hard data.

Feed it once every 3-4 days until the fish passes all the bacteria, and goes right side up. Then feed it once a day. Too much protein-laced Goldfish food. If you really like your goldfish, feed it a veggie-based  salt-water flakes/pellets. (Food for salt water fish) It is the same stuff, just better quality. These fish are bred to be shaped like that, unfortunately the process has left them with a sensitive digestive system even though they want to eat their weight in flakes every feeding it is so bad to let them.

Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour.

And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again.

But also for an entirely different reason--realizing this is /r/pics and not /r/aerodynamics, anyone not interested in aerodynamics turn back, move along, nothing to see here...

This is the first visualization in the natural world (i.e., not in a wind tunnel) I've come across that illustrates adverse yaw, the use of differential aileron to correct it, and the effect it exerts on the tracking of ""wake"" or wing tip vortices.  As anyone who has spent time near a major airport knows, the little whirlwinds that stream off wing tips or edges of flaps--and which the **[newish winglets](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/24/business/Why-Winglets.html?_r=0)** try to combat--descend after the plane has passed and can make a crackling noise or disturb the tops of trees when they descend to ground level.

If the pilot is skimming above cloud tops as in this photo, those vortices will descend behind the plane and the combined **[""downwash""](https://tianyizf1.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/trailing-vortex.jpg)** from where the tip vortices meet will disturb the clouds--that's why we only see one ""slice"" caused by the two tip vortices in this image, but **[this photo](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/downwash.html)** of a business jet penetrating just the tops of the clouds illustrates the two separate wing tip vortices.

However, if you look closely, notice that, as the aircraft banks to the right, the slice is displaced to the outside of the turn, to the left of the aircraft track.  The reason for this is asymmetric induced drag--the downward deflecting aileron that raises the left wing tip causes a momentary increase in what is known as induced drag.  Simply said, banking to the right makes the left wing tip vortex stronger than its counterpart on the right.  The increased lift caused by the lowered aileron causes that wing to pull up and back harder than the right wing is ""pulled"" down, whose aileron is up.

That increase in drag would tend to pull the nose of the aircraft to the left, towards the outboard wing, which is a bad thing from an aerodynamics stand point--it requires more rudder to maintain coordinated flight, and thus, more drag to overcome, so higher fuel costs.  So a concept called **[differential aileron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/DifferentialAileron.svg)** is employed to cause the inboard (right) wing to raise the aileron more than the outboard (left) wing lowers its aileron.  But here's the key: the raised aileron results in more drag, but largely in the form of separation drag--that's when the air doesn't flow smoothly over the upper wing surface, but starts to get more turbulent.  This disruption in airflow causes more drag to be generated across the wing, but keeps the amount of outward **[spanwise flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:Tip_vortex_rollup.png)**on the upper wing surface lower. Spanwise flow is responsible for initiating wing tip vortices and winglets attempt to minimize it. The end effect is the generation of a smaller wing tip vortex on the inboard wing.

We're in the home stretch: when the two wing tip vortices combine, one stronger, the other weaker, their interaction causes the net downwash of airflow in the wake of the aircraft to track toward the stronger wing tip vortex, and thus as they descend, will veer to the outside of the turn.  Furthermore, the bank angle of the aircraft will accentuate this effect, as the lateral force component of the stronger wing tip vortex will bias the downwash to the outboard side. This is what we can see clearly from this otherwise picturesque, very cool shot.

**TL;DR: Perfect visualization of induced drag in a turning aircraft which biases the downwash to the outside of the turn.**

NOTE: For the pilots and perfectionists here, though the pilot eases up on the yoke/stick input that initiated the turn after the bank angle is established, a little bit of inboard bank input is held to prevent the natural stabilizing effect that aircraft with dihedral experience, which requires more lift on the outboard wing to counter the increased upward lift component on the inboard, more horizontal wing, which still results in a differential in induced drag between wingtips.  These changes in control surface input during turns are responsible when you see **[strake/LEX and wing tip vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices#/media/File:FA-18C_vapor_LEX_and_wingtip_1.jpg)** appear during airshow demonstrations more prevalently as hard turns are initiated, which then dissipate/disappear when the pilot establishes bank angle and/or unloads.BEWARE!

Legit question: 

How does lightning strike from a volcano cloud? I've only ever seen lightning in the clouds from the sky, before, so this is a new concept to me. How am I supposed to get all the way up there with just this stupid ring and my stupid midget buddies?

""Who disturbs my slumber?""Shit like this is why ancient civilizations believed in cool gods.OMG I CAN CONTRIBUTE.

Okay, fun fact about Venus, the atmosphere is to thick and hot for rain, so when it rains sulfuric acid on venus it evaporates a few km above the surface.

But there is lightning? Lightning on earth comes with rainstorms, but the lack of rainstorms on venus means that the lightning  comes from the volcanic ash buildup in the atmosphere.This is WILD. High quality pics post right here. Quetzalcoatl returnsHolly shit!!! I never thought I'd see something from my hometown on reddit. I use to live less than 10 miles from this volcano.

Am I saying that right?'Guys, I said, *don't* let the avatar get on top of the mountain!'When I visit *la familia*, this volcano is visible from the *Capilla* which sits on the road which leads down to the village. It's only slightly visible on the clearest of days, but the fucker is imposing once you notice it.

[Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about.

LIZARDPEOPLE CONFIRMED. I see a little silhouetto of a manNOT illegal. Defacement of currency laws apply to paper money. Regarding coins, a fraudulent intent is required. The use of coins to make souvenirs (pressed pennies for example,) or artwork such as this is not fraudulent, and is legal. See 18 USC Sections 331 and 475.

I'm a jeweller in Australia and do this when I am bored at work. Just use a drill and a saw, no frickin lasers needed. Mom's going to be *sooo* pissed when she sees what you did to her good scissors.ITT: everyone thinks this is illegal. It is not. You can do whatever you want with money in your possession (because it is legally *your* property until you spend it), as long as the intent is not to defraud. In other words, as long as you're not doing something like clipping corners off $100 bills and gluing them to $1 bills to rip off a store, printing counterfeit currency, etc. you can basically do as you please with your own money.

The idea that ""defacing"" money for artistic purposes (or just because you're bored) is a felony or somehow illegal, is an urban legend. Note that this is for the USA, other countries have their own laws.

I believe the stadium was modeled after a dragon, and yup those are all solar panels that power the whole thing.  I was last there to watch a world cup qualifier game against Myanmar, which Taiwan lost, unfortunately.

The city has a lot of cool innovative projects, and an interesting history.  The mayor, a woman and former political prisoner, has undertaken some substantial projects, in spite of limited support from national government (city budget was cut due to ""overspending"" on public projects).  She's put a lot of support behind art projects and interesting buildings, such as this stadium built for the World Games in 2009.  There are 5 of them, I think.

* a [recently completed library](http://imgur.com/a/E74VO) whose floors are held up by suspension cables connected to central columns (allowing more light and windows all around, pretty nice for a library).  It's completely free for residents and guests, and you can always find a window seat there.  Also, after the budget cuts, it ended up being entirely funded by private donations.  This was a big deal, because otherwise the project could not have succeeded.

* [Pier 2](https://www.google.com/search?q=pier+2+kaohsiung&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMIgIbKv7DbxgIVTBiUCh25IAF8&biw=1366&bih=611) is a cool arts area with several old warehouses converted to art exhibitions.  Exhibits change every month, and most of it is free entry, with some outdoor and some indoor parts.  Recently, they started opening some new government-sponsored arts and crafts shops.  You can see the city is putting a lot of effort behind supporting the arts.  This is not something you see everywhere in Asia, so it is kind of cool and unique
* Nearby [nice beach on Cijin island](http://cleaningjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/P1010427.jpg) (although not coveted by locals because it has black sand, which gets hotter under the sun).  Still, people go there for seafood and I hear some foreigners are [setting up a hostel there](https://bitcoinhousetaiwan.wordpress.com/).  This could be a cooler place if there were a beach bar and more places to stay on the island.  Currently the area serves as day-trip tourist spot, a home to a fishing community, and container ship loading / unloading spot.
* It's easy to get around by scooter.  There's a 2-line subway, buses are FREE, and a bike share system that's free for < 1 hour.  They're still building more public transport options.
* Monkey mountain is 5 minutes away, and nice to hike up when you want to get away from city noises.  Monkeys often [sit on the path](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qi4If0y9EMM/maxresdefault.jpg) and don't bother people (as long as you aren't carrying food)
* Taiwan also has many mountains and waterfalls in its interior.  From Kaohsiung, weekend trips to Pingtung for hiking and swimming are common.
* It rarely rains here (as opposed to Taipei) and has a nice climate, with a long fall/spring-like season (which are nice where I'm from in NE US).  The difference in rainfall between north / south Taiwan apparently has something to do with the Tropic of Cancer running right through the middle.
* There's a lot more I'm missing, but it's a nice city.  The north seems to view Kaohsiung as a blue collar city where all the port-workers are because historically that's what it was.  It still has those things, but also has a lot of other nice things, largely thanks to their mayor.

The one drawback is Taiwan produces its own share of pollution and also supposedly gets some from nearby China.  Also, Kaohsiung is a port city.  But, I've been around China and there is certainly less pollution here.  I think some people don't know much about Taiwan, unfortunately due to its unconfirmed status as its own country.  Often you hear ""Chinese Taipei"" in the news, or ""Taiwan province"", but those names are just used to get along with China (complicated history here).  It actually has its own government and freedom of press etc.

I'm obviously not a spokesperson for Kaohsiung, but it's rarely in the news so thought I'd share some details =).  If you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer them!Designed by the Riddler...Does this generate enough electricity to power the entire stadium? [National Stadium (Kaohsiung)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stadium_\(Kaohsiung\))It's fucking beautiful!That is what every house and building should look like.im taiwanese and i didn't even know that this existedIt's an Enigma on how they did thisI feel like I don't see enough of this kind of innovation in America.?Meanwhile, at the Curious Question Mark Stadium, the Riddler plots his latest puzzle for the caped crusader...Serious question: How cost-effective is this? As in, was it so outrageously expensive to solar-retrofit that it would take an obscene amount of time to recuperate the expenses and have any sort of reasonable ROI? Is it just a gimmick?

Edit: wordWhy is North America so behind?Wow, they must love track and field.I feel like the panels were all upright until Mr.magoo went to see a game and hijinks ensued. I lived in this city for two great years. The level of innovation and progress that has happened in Kaohsiung in the past 15 years is staggering.So cool seeing solar panels used as a design element instead of something to just tack on haphazardly. >The stadium will hold the record for largest solar-powered stadium in the world with it’s 14,155m2 roof. It could potentially generate  1.14 gigawatt hours of electricity every year

... almost enough to go back in timeIt looks like a question mark Speaking of that John Oliver is our one true god and all knowing. I'm pretty sure if us the tax payers bankroll stadiums we should at least make them solar powered. built by the Riddler.This is GREAT! This shows that the Taiwanese are on top of things. I wish more buildings did this. There's tons of buildings where I live with all kinds of empty space and nothing up there - imagine throwing up even 10 panels per roof, on hundreds of buildings? 

Wouldn't change the world but it would certainly provide a nice break for the power grid.

He did most of the heavy lifting with the body work and paint and he had the knowledge.  I learned a tremendous amount during the process and it was an awesome experience overall.  

I started collecting parts and restoring smaller pieces in my basement starting about 3 years ago.  Then a year and a half ago we pulled it into the shop to really start all the work.

Edit:  Sorry for the late replies to questions.  I feel like I was just initiated into owning a vintage car -- a day after its first car show, it left me stranded 1.5hrs from home.  Lessons have been learned about distributor points gaps, ignition coils, and lack of spark.  But all is good, the car is back home safely in the garage.At that point, aren't you pretty much just building a new car from scratch?Can you label which is before and which is after?One of the more impressive things I've all week and that includes reposts.The pride and satisfaction that you get from building your dream car rather than buy it is something that few will understand.  Congratulations, OP.  That is a sweet car. Noice, how much money did you lay down?Previous owner of a restored '69 here. My advice for you : Start hunting down door glass from a '70 right now. Thank me later.

I lost two driver's windows due to that shitty design where the driver's window glass glues into the attaching bracket at the bottom of the pane instead of being held in place by some grommets like the '70 glass. When you shut it, it's got a non-zero chance of just shattering no matter how hard or soft you close your doors. The '70 glass doesn't have this problem. I lost two windows in about 2 years, then my '70 glass lasted until I sold the car. Get a set now for when this happens to you. You're welcome.

You also will have better sealing against the rain. The window seal on the 70 glass is on the quarter glass instead of the door glass. This would also be my dream car, however living in Northern Ireland sucks, I'd say import taxes etc would be steep. One day though... One day I'll restore or outright buy one.

>“I’ve never seen a baby whale breach like J50’s been doing,” said Michael Harris, executive director of PWWA, which represents 33 operators in Washington and British Columbia. ”Her energy is astounding – I guess not unlike my small kids.  She’s constantly leaping into the air, and often curling up and doing belly flops. Of course we never know exactly why orcas breach, but when you see a young one do what J50’s been doing, over and over again, and being so playful and affectionate as she is with her family members, you sorta lose that cold scientific analysis and just conclude she’s leaping for joy. It’s definitely a joy to watch.”

>On July 4, whale watchers on an Eagle Wings Tour in Victoria got a show from J50.

>“J50 stole the show, and hearts, with more than 60 breaches as she and her family moved south in Haro Strait,” said Clint Rivers, a naturalist and photographer. “It’s like she just figured out how this breaching thing works and couldn’t stop. She was still breaching well into the evening.”

>J50 was born about two weeks after J-Pod lost a female member while she was giving birth. That dropped the population to 77 whales. However, researchers believe that two members of the pod actually mid-wifed the birth of J50, pulling the baby out of its mother.  The teeth marks can still be seen on J50’s back.

>“Maybe all this exuberance somehow has something to do with that, this miracle birth,” said Harris. “Who knows?  Maybe the other members of her family realize how precious she is, and how close she came to never making it into this world.  Perhaps with all of this love surrounding her, this baby orca is just bursting with happiness. There’s no doubt that J50 feels safe and well-cared for, like all of these babies are.  We have some amazing families out there.” - [Source](http://globalnews.ca/news/2116833/photos-orca-preschool-in-the-salish-sea-is-good-news-for-endangered-whales/)Don't know if this is the same one.

Just like space for us.This would push for ""Free Willy 4: Lil Willy"" to run the franchise to the ground... like the AirBud did.I went on a whale-watching tour when visiting Victoria, BC last year. It amazed me to learn that these whales live in small families and range in age from infant to 50+ year old adults.

Was it from this guy?Oh no, I arrived here too late! A college friend of my dad's would always hold the ""P.O.O.P"" awards, a challenge to see what unpackaged items people could send through the USPS.(I can't remember what the acronym was for) He also enjoyed the challenge,  We would receive on the regular fully inflated beach balls, rubber ducks, whoopie cushions, anything and everything. He held a big one one year for his birthday, and the stakes were high. One person sent him a toilet seat. My Dad won with a computer keyboard, the letters rearranged to say Happy Birthday.

In ancient societies black truffles that grew from the ground were often harvested and used as aphrodisiacs. Unscrupulous vendors would often pick lowly potatoes and try to pass them off as these special black truffles, which created the term ""to truffle"" or swindel someone, which survives today as ""to trifle."" Whoever sent that potato be triflin' mang. This reminds me of a story when I was working in France on a camp site. A friend of mine back in the Netherlands decided that he had to send me a grilled cheese sandwich because I didn't have a toaster in my tent. Too be honest I wasn't really expecting him to actually do it. But, sure enough, after about two weeks I got a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed in one of those bubble wrap envelopes.

The original axe currently resides in the Copenhagen National Museum in Denmark. The axe is dated to 970-971 AD, and is thought to have belonged to an individual of high status, likely a chieftain. Jan Petersen categorized axes used during the Viking Age based on the shape of their heads. He classified them into twelve varieties, Types A-M (there is no Type J). The axe head of the Mammen axe is best described as a Petersen Type G. Although the axe head is partially corroded and the haft is gone, the beauty and elegance of the axe are still easily visible.

So they were actually quiet for the movie. So if you remember the movie, Dr. Grant hypothesizes that dinosaurs evolved into birds. At the end of the movie, they all fly away on the helicopter and Dr. Grant looks out the window and sees a flock of birds. 

The man turned to his wife and proudly proclaimed ""Them's dinosaurs.""I remember being a young kid - maybe 5 - and my dad pointing at a heron in our pond.

""See that? That's a dinosaur.""

Mind you, this was the early 80s, and my dad is a high school dropout. All his education was on his own, book learning and real life, yet he had come to this conclusion.

My response, ""That doesn't look like a dinosaur."" Then the heron took off. He told me, ""Go look in your books at flying dinosaurs now.""

I looked at the book later and it hit me. That really was a dinosaur! From that point on, I viewed dinosaurs as bird-like, and birds as the descendents of dinosaurs. It just made sense to me. And then I read that book by some guy named Crichton, and it made even more sense.

I also remember one of my HS science teachers ridiculing me for thinking that. Her argument, ""If they are birds, why does their name mean 'terrible lizard'?""

That was the only time the class bully ever stuck up for me - mainly because he saw his chance to get a dig in at the teacher.

Most of the vaults today are multiple panels of metal skinned concrere welded together, with rebar and hardened metal pieces in it to make this sort of thing take even longer. I've had to bore a number of 4 inch holes through a poured vault wall and it could take 30+ minutes if you got unlucky.

http://imgur.com/a/nRCB8When I first saw the picture it gave the illusion to me that the hole was big enough for a person to stand up in but it's only about 1.5 feet wide and 1.5 feet deep. This happens in movies, not real life. Someone on the team has a dirty contact in the mining industry, or a brother, etc. The contact lets them into the worksite to steal an industrial boring machine that they carry to the bank wall in a stolen van that can barely hold the drill. They bore all night, shutting it down when the night guard comes around so he doesn't hear it. They get through with only 30 minutes before the bank opens and just get all the loot out when the auto lock on the vault door clicks open.

It stars Brad Pitt, Jackie Chan and Nick Nolte, for some reason.This is how I drill holes at home...  Oops, oops-NOW it's wide enough! I'm kinda sad they didn't film the heist with a GoPro or something like that. Seeing that live would be awesome and I think the desire to film that would be why I never could stage a successful heist.""Off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros and a Leon Spinks, not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever!""How the hell did no one notice?Weird and completely off topic, the thumbnail immediately made me look back at a picture I took a few weeks ago in someone's garden:

http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-32414531

This was at a safety deposit building in Central London and the raid was done over the Easter long weekend. 
The hole is 18""x10"" and approx. 20"" deep. 

The criminals dressed as contruction workers and prior to starting had advised people in the area of ongoing construction so they wouldn't be concerned about the noise. They busted in (bringing the drill in in a wheelie bin) and then spent most of the long weekend in there drilling the holes and pillaging the boxes. The security guard apparently didn't investigate at any time and despite the police picking up an intruder alarm they coded the call in a way that they decided not to respond. (There was something about the way they respond to an alarm if there had previously been multiple false alarms...this lead to speculation that the theives intitially set off the false alarms in the hope that it would deter PD from actually responding when a genuine alarm went off).
 The thieves made out with approx. $300 million worth of goods from 70+ boxes and we know nothing else as to their whereabouts/who they are etc.

Sounds like a game of Payday to me.I work with these coring machines on a regular basis. They're very loud especially when you're dry coring through concrete, more so when the concrete has had time to cure. I don't understand people posting comments about having the machine catch when it tilts off axis, the first thing you do when setting up for a hole is level the drill and bolt it to the floor/wall. Some of the newer drills have a suction pump and gaskets to mount to places you can't anchor to. 

I can drill 30 inches of concrete with rebar in it with a new bit in under 15 minutes but it's still ungodly loud.
Silent drilling perk always pays off. I wonder how many times it jammed....Guys, the thermal drill!

Had no idea he had a stroke! I had no idea about his stroke either, so from Wikipedia :

>On 23 May 2013, Curry was said to have suffered a major stroke  at his home in Los Angeles . Although many sources suggested the stroke had made it difficult for him to speak, his longtime agent Marcia Hurwitz told the Daily Mail ""Tim is doing great,"" and that 'He absolutely can speak and is recovering at this time and in great humour'. Shortly after the initial report, Hurwitz told The Hollywood Reporter  that the stroke actually occurred in July 2012 and that Curry had been going to physical therapy. Every time I hear his name, the 1st image that pops into my head is [this Grinchy smile](http://i.imgur.com/1A9xa0V.gif) (sorry for the shitty tumblr gif) after he confirms little Kevin McAllister's credit card was reported stolen. Seeing him now just makes me so sad, but on the other hand, I couldn't be happier that his condition is good enough to let him keep high spirits and continue to work doing voice acting. Could have been sooo much worse.
Got to interview him there... Was so sad to see him in such a bad condition. He hardly had the energy to talk. :(

[Pic taken during the interview, in case anyone was curious](http://i.imgur.com/cyg6BZR.jpg)Many years ago, I had the great pleasure of working with Tim on a pilot shot for CBS that never aired. It was a remake of ""Topper"" with Curry playing the lead. The hours were incredibly long and I was a office production assistant who could occasionally pick up overnight shifts on set. One particularly long and exhausting night, I found myself sitting in a director's chair off to the side of one of the sets, and next to me was Tim. It was just the two of us, and he was as kind and gracious to me as anyone I've ever met. He opened our conversation by exclaiming, ""I like your Mickey,"" a reference to the Mickey Mouse watch I'd been given for a year's tenure on the Disney lot. From there we talked about his career, he asked what I could see myself doing as I imagined the career which lay ahead of me. I confided I spent a year performing The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Nuart Theater in Santa Monica. He never batted an eye, he never waivered in his interest. The guy is an absolute class act, and it's a goddamn shame his health hasn't lived up to his personality or his talent. He's such a talented dude, but due to the roles he played, whenever I see his face I'll probably feel a little intimidated. You'd think him being in a wheelchair would make him less menacing, but it actually does quite the oppposite. Whoever does Pennywise the Clown in the 'It' remake has some mighty big shoes to fill, pun intended.   Tim Curry was absolutely perfect in that role.> Don't get strung out by the way I look...

> Don't judge a book by it's cover...Man, it fucking sucks to see him like that. That stroke ruined such a great smile. Wow... I feel completely horrible now! I wasn't even aware he had a damn stroke.  Completely awesome actor and one of those faces and voices you'd notice at a glance. I didn't even recognize him (without double checking) when I looked at the post. So many Rocky Horror Picture Show (live & propped) shows that my wife and I have attended make me feel horrible for not knowing that this happened.

Was it overplayed or underplayed I n the media? Honest question here??? I'm honestly at a loss for not knowing..
Well really... That's no way to behave on your first day out. But uhm, since you're such exceptional beauty, I'm prepared to forgive you.This was the first story I saw this morning and it really bummed me out. I knew he had a stroke but I did not realize the severity. 

I think the reason people are wondering why the stroke wasn't reported more is because it's reporting was downplayed. 

I need to go back and read initial reports but I feel like it gave off the impression of ""He had a stroke but nbd.""He will always be the dude from Home Alone 2 to me.

""What's the matter, store wouldn't take your **STOLEN CREDIT CARD**??Tim Curry rocks, stroke or not.
This makes my heart hurt. This is what happened to me just a month ago. It's hard to live with sometimes, I had a great smile, very good with people, now the looks I get in return. Every time I talk to someone they also have this uncontrollable urge to mimic the look, I bet most people who look at this pic try to mimic it as well.This makes me so sad! Muppet's Treasure Island was a huge childhood staple of mine! I had no idea!Hey.... Why don't we recognize the fact that he is out in public and on a red carpet??? Yes, I agree it's very sad (LOVED Rocky Horror growing up) and I, too, had no idea about the stroke....But I think it's remarkable that he is out in public, knowing he no longer fits society's obsession with being ""red carpet ready"". I think it's fantastic and brings awareness to life continuing on, post-stroke.Oh no, why wasn't this bigger news?  Maybe he could recover enough to one day return to the stage in the Dr. Scott role.  We should all write to him or something, tell him how much we appreciate his work, how unique and unforgettable he's been, how we hope he gets better or at least realizes that he's so loved as an artist. Last time I had the chance to write to a favorite public figure of mine (who was severely ill) I didn't, and I've sincerely regretted it. His performance as the Lord of Darkness was the best I've ever seen in such a role (Satanic bad guy). From the 1985 Ridley Scott film with Tom Cruise. I always thought he'd make an amazing Joker.Does anyone remember him as the Real Estate swindler in Roseanne?I cant believe noone has mentioned him for his part in Red Alert 3 :(

http://www.knucklebusterinc.com/features/2010/07/15/1930-art-deco-henderson/*And yes, Mr Wayne. It does come in black.*""Henderson produced 4-cylinder motorcycles from 1912 until 1931. ""They were the largest and fastest motorcycles of their time, and appealed to sport riders and police departments. Police favored them for traffic patrol because they were faster than anything on the roads. The company began during the golden age of motorcycling, and ended during the Great Depression.""  From wikipedia.

1930 Henderson ""Special"" KL


""On April 29, 1930, the new Henderson ""Special"" KL solo was demonstrated on a new, smooth concrete Illinois highway. Joe Petrali achieved 116.12 mph and 109.09 mph on two recorded runs, averaging 112.61. The higher compression two-ring pistons, and an enlarged 1.25 inch (32 mm) carburetor, meant the KL engine produced 45 hp at 4,500 rpm. The KL was remarkably flexible in top gear, pulling smoothly from 8 to 110 mph. They were even more popular with police departments in the United States.

The ""Special"" (KL) model was priced $30 more than the regular KJ model, and was available in 1930 and 1931."" 

 I wonder how many were built?Looks like one of those bikes from some 1900's movie about the future.

The lens is stopped down, meaning the hole in the lens that lets light in is made to be very small, which makes things both close up and far away to be in focus, causing the scene appear flat.

If the aperture was opened up, the primary subject, probably the dog in this case, would be in focus and the background would be blurry, giving the image a sense of depth, and thereby ruining the illusion.

Funny story about the movie, I was watching it at a airport bar, I was using faulty headphones that I just bought but did not work. Like an idiot I was wearing the headphones for about 2 min before I realized only my laptop speaker was playing sound. Well everyone was starring at me thinking I was watching porn as Reese Witherspoon in the opening scene does some crazy grunting and screaming trying to get that boot off.  Closest I could find - https://youtu.be/Wd4qsQXmdRQ?t=1m41s 

~~I can't believe no one has posted a video of the scene~~How did they realize it was from the movie when they found it? I would've assumed someone just unfortunately lost a boot sometime ago and I've seen the film. Still, very neat regardless. Cool, an Astros hat.http://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/reese-witherspoon-wild-boot.gifOn the topic of Reese Witherspoon apparel: My dad was once a limo driver and has a pair of sunglasses she once left behind.This reminds me of a short story in a book I read yeeeears ago where two guys decide to track down where their favorite actor threw a tire iron off of a cliff in a movie he was filming near their town. They track it down, and find it in a cave, and while they're* in there, this cave fills with women, and it's apparently this female cult who's initiation is to have sex with the tire iron so they can basically be having sex with the actor. They take a polaroid of the new girl doing it, and hang it on the wall with everyone else's picture.

I haven't thought about that shit in years, and I can't seem to find the book through google.

(Fixed some typos. It's pretty late, sorry)Did he sniff it?  Park ranger goes out and throws a fresh boot over everyday for hikers to find.Hey, Reese Witherspoon called.

I mean, maybe there was just wire at that point, and he was standing on the East German side ushering the kid into the east side. Or maybe he hopped over to the West German side to lift the wire to let the kid through to the west side. Or maybe the wall is behind him so they're still on the East German side but he is letting the kid gain access to the wall so he can climb over to the west side.

Recently we had a rash of the glass panes shattering.

Edit: environmental effects: [Outch, my nose \(it's snowing outside\)!](http://imgur.com/1VOjtlz)Wow! Blew the propeller right off!It's crazy to think what happens when the wrong aircraft gets damaged.

2 years ago, a British Airways, Boeing 747's wing hit a building in South Africa. Because the 747's are reaching the end of their economical lifespans, it was scrapped.

[Here's a reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/333sd4/remember_the_ba_747_that_took_a_wrong_turn_in/) about it from /r/aviation last week.[My god, shields, SHIELDS!](https://youtu.be/lDKmSxJkOWA)Looks like my buttholeDamage to airplanes is *ridiculously* expensive to fix, no matter how insignificant. Nah fuck this. I'm flying on Monday I'm outa hereAnd one more reason not to be afraid of flying. It was able to land normally after *that* happened to it.As an aircraft mechanic... This makes me cry... Not only the radome, the structure under, the windows... Oh God. Not to mention the leading edge on the wings...Just a radome, come off with a few bolts. 

Edit: The nose radome is made of substantially weaker materials than the rest of the aircraft. They're usually a fiberglass material, so the radar inside of them can penetrate it with ease. especially if it hits your wind screen. 

http://i.stack.imgur.com/vF3cX.jpgWhat about the engines? 

*sorry, turbinesWhen your going through hell, keep going. What the hail were those pilots thinking? That is the expensive radar part that got hit too. I'm honestly more interested in what if any damage occurred to the engines and flight surfaces. Jet engines are surprisingly fragile.Through Jessica's mind flashed all the warning about such storms - that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones.  She felt the buffering of dust-blanketed wind.  It twisted them as Paul fought the control.  She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck.  The metal around them hissed and trembled.  
  
""Sand!""  Jessica shouted.  
  
She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel.  ""Not much sand this high.""  
  
But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.  
  
Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain.  He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.  
  
The sound of their passage diminished.  
  
The 'thopter began rolling off to the left.  Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.  
  
Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion was external.  A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.  
  
*Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour*, she thought.  Adrenalin edginess gnawed at her.  *I must not fear*, she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany.  *Fear is the mind-killer*.  
  
Slowly her years of training prevailed.  
  
Calmness returned.  
  
""We have the tiger by the tail,"" Paul whispered.  ""We can't go down, can't land... and I don't think I can lift us out of this.  We'll have to ride it out.""  
  
Calmness drained out of her.  Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together.  Then she heard Paul's voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:  
  
""Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear's path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain.""

Then this Vespa owner will have to waste his valuable time contesting a $50 ticket, which doubles after 30 days. 
I'm a little salty about parking tickets.This should be on r/shittydesign. Both signs should be on the same pole. I lived in SF for about 4 years and had a couple of motorcycles. I worked downtown and easily found free parking for my bike. There were even motorcycle metered spots that only costed 5 cents an hour. Two quarters you were good for the day. 

If my ex wife and I went out to a busy spot for dinner, I would take a bike and just park it on the sidewalk. The fine was around $30, and over 3 years I only got a couple of tickets.

SF is very motorcycle friendly and the cool weather allowed you to wear a leather jacket year round.And that's how you fucking do that.Must be a lawyer. Fucking loopholes. They'll find them. Following the letter of the law, not necessarily the spirit.There used to be a spot on Armitage and Lincoln like this, but you could actually put a full-size car there.  My roommates and I always competed for this sneaky spot.  I've moved but I'm pretty sure they've since corrected it.  Of course this is in ChicagoYep...I do this every day. I always feel like I am giving the city parking enforcement people a massive giant middle finger. Been parking like this since 2004...not a single ticket. 

It is especially gratifying when all of loop and river north and west loop have been purposefully made so that there are less parking spaces at every intersection corners...look it up. All the corners are now Tow Zones where there used to be an extra parking spot. By corners I mean the first parking space at an intersection is now Tow ZoneReminds me of a scene from [5 Centimeters per Second](http://i.imgur.com/wqX1bkU.jpg).

I don't know about this particular bug, but the iridescence for lots of insects is the result of complex light interference produced by microstructures in their shells. It's not just due to coloration.[Beetleborgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUwM_mKS4c)Those are pretty cool.I've never seen a more gorgeous bug in my life.I thought it was painted fingernails from the *thumbnail*.  The amount of species diversity on our planet always amazes me. Our planet is so unique and awesome. Wow, those are absolutely beautiful. Awe!

All I can think is that they will all turn around and race up my sleeve full-speed. they're like jewels. Isn't there some instance of people attaching them with dainty little manacles to crawl around as a clothing decoration? It'd be worth it to keep them fed and healthy.

The paper in question is *New Straits Times*, and the date is Thursday, July 16, 2015, and this is a screenshot of these two pages from the e-paper: http://imgur.com/HD2o6gA

You can check yourself: http://digital.nstp.com.my/nst/books/150716nstnews (pages 18-19). Note that you only can ""test"" the e-paper for 90 seconds.

EDIT: The page to the right is probably from an another newspaper. You can notice that the New Straits Times would use the format ""NEW STRAITS TIMES | PAGE 19"" in the upper right corner, while the page to the right uses some other format.I worked for a newspaper for awhile, and even if an editor caught this, they'd still run it, we reallllly didn't care what ran as long as the client paid. (and the clients often paid for full page ads to rant about all sorts of things that really shouldn't be published in a newspaper)It looks like the one on the right is stacked on 2 other magazines and isn't actually side-by-side in the same mag.[We got that B-Roll](https://youtu.be/SItFvB0Upb8)Probably a template ad that has been authorised for Hari Raya Aidilfitri, where the sponsors pick from a limited list of templates.

Last time I was there, Hari Raya and Chinese New Year were happening during the same week. From all the fireworks and firecrackers every day, it sounded like a war zone. What's raya?You have really stupid nightmares.[r/wtfstockphotos](/r/wtfstockphotos)in the film *The Death of ""Superman Lives"": What Happened?* - writer/director Kevin Smith was telling a story about how the Superman film he had earlier written the script for - had locked up a building in Pittsburgh that he wanted to use as a location for his film *Dogma*.

I had to ponder a bit why the building would not allow two entirely different films to use their building.  My conclusion was that it was to prevent this kind of thing happening - two movies released the same year that looked too similar?  That it was something the studio contracts with the building tried to prevent. My best guess.Is it just me, or are those different languages...Lol. Malaysian newspaper fail. /r/CrappyDesign Time for ""Who did it better""!!!""Celebrate the assurance of their future...44 years of quality living.""

Looks like a before and after ad. Malaysia has discovered eternal youthThis is why you buy your stock photos from a company that guarantees that once you buy it, they won't continue selling it to others.I have to imagine this is somewhat like when two women show up at a hoity-toity party wearing the same dress...  Awkward...This is like ""Bring It On"" all over again... the job of a prepress department is to catch things like this before its goes to print and contact the client to have a proper resolution as to what to do.I work for a multicultural ad agency and this is one of my biggest fears. We have found the end of the universe.With so many different stock photos what are the chances of this happening? Same magazine, 1 page apart. It looks like this is one case where the stock photo aren't going to save them money.You're all surprised someone let this happen, but I'm a lazy fuck and if I saw this I'd be like 'oh well, not my responsibility'. They paid for adspace, they got adspace. They chose their own pictures.

- Everyone in the center. The trucks should slowly drive around the circle so you get a random truck when you get to the front of the line.[deleted]Anyone else reminded of the Bob's Burgers episode with the food truck? I went to a food truck event called Off the Grid at Fort Mason in San Francisco a few years back.  It was total fucking chaos with trucks lined up like circled wagons and lines had to triple back and forth on themselves with no rhyme or reason due to lack of space for all the people..  I was waiting in a line for a food truck and after 10 minutes about 30 people all realized that the line snaked a different direction and we were actually standing in line behind a garbage can and not even in the line...

Here in Houston they have food truck events where you pay $5 to get in and then have the privilege of paying $10 to $15 for a ""authentic"" burger or taco. Are you fucking kidding me?Food trucks are great, but they're NEVER worth the wait at events like this. And half the time, by the time you get to the front of the line, they've run out of whatever it was you wanted.Is the sexy pianist there?The trucks are supposed to come to us.

Everyone heading to the trucks in one spot defeats the purpose.I will never stand in line for an hour to get a small portion of overpriced, POSSIBLY good food.  There was a food truck festival in my city recently.  I browsed through and had lunch at a local restaurant.Not worth it.As an Englishman, I find this picture orgasmic.This is why I disagree with food truck festivals as a concept. Food trucks are supposed to provide good food to places out of the way of quality restaurants (e.g. breweries, working districts, festivals). This is just forcing people to stand in a line for food that I probably wouldn't normally pay for sitting down.Lolla Pa-foods-aWow, that looks like some kind of other worldly shitty time. Hot sun, waiting in line, paying for food with no service, no shade, no place to sit. Ya, awesome. not worth the waitatlanta food truck festival was a huge disaster....waited in line for two hours to receive my shrimp po-boy....it was good but not that damn good..Where is this?Looks like Picnic at the Presidio in San Francisco!Folks in spokes.There needs to be a food truck in the center of that circle for those that lack the willpower to stay.I wouldn't wait in a line that long for a kidney transplant.You guys see food truck lines. 

I see Comcast customer service lines...and not a single toilet in sight.

I talked to my buddy who works for the FAA in SC (facility in which this occured) and he told me that the F16 pilot was in the GCA pattern talking to air traffic control. The Cessna was a VFR pop up and was climbing through their airspace without talking to ATC. ATC saw the traffic and gave a turn to the F16 but he didn't take it and next thing you know there's a mid air.
Seems ATC there have been having issues with VFR guys climbing through their pattern and refer to the VFR pop ups as ""killer bees""

Paper cups, all cleaned up and recycled after. They also raised a ton of money for charity, and brought awareness of healthy farming and sustainable food options to tens of thousands of runners. It brought together the community in a healthy and happy atmosphere. 

But uh yeah, focus on the cups. 

Edit: [bonus pic](http://imgur.com/t8brlFu)Pretty normal for a race, it really hurts to start and stop even for a second. Every runner gets as close as they can to the trash and lets the volunteers take care of it.I have one word for you Benjamin...Well Earth Day is basically just a massive greenwashing PR stunt. It's pretty obvious from all of the very un-environmentally friendly corporations that claim to back it.I hope they are biodegradable corn plastic.


But...... I know they are not. :( can we just get over the fact that public events will always have a good chunk of people who don't care and we can't control which will litter? yes it's sadder because it was an event about taking care of the planet but really it's not like it becomes an ecological catastrophy if it's not cleaned up before a few hours.I know it's not socially acceptable to punch someone in the head for littering....but man do I wish it was. Can anyone id the motorcycle in the back? It looks kinda cool *Ben, I want to say one word to you, just one word: Plastics.*Nevermind the hypocrisy of it all, did the runners get their precious stickers for their car so we all find out how far they can run??Assuming the intend was to highlight that Nat Geo is using plastic cups, but clearly those unfamiliar with public races don't realize this is how water stations work. Staff fills cups, runners take cups and grab a mouthful as they run, runners toss cups, staff cleans up cups.Pretty funny! But as much as I love to find irony in situations such as this, I really don't see an issue. The amount of money raised for environmental activism and environmental awareness created from this run probably far outweighs the cups left on the ground. 

A similar analogy is Al Gore flying to a conference on climate change. He's flying a plane that emits CO2, but it's still in the name of progress.Its not like they dont clean up the cups after the race. This looks like one of those hyper-realistic 3D chalk drawingsERFDEYThat grinds my gears that they use plastic cups on a race to support Earth day... oxymoronic, really.I volunteered to help with a Mud Run in my area, and I got to work the water station. We didn't have cups provided for us so we had to improvise by pouring the water directly into the participant's mouths as they were passing by--no waste beyond the bottles themselves, so that was neat.

It was pretty fun because you felt more a part of the event beyond just filling a table with cups of water or handing them out to be tossed before the upcoming obstacle.

Eventually we started asking runners, ""mouth, face or hands"" for either a drink or to help wash off the fresh mud from a previous pit. Everyone seemed to enjoy the unique service we provided--plenty of muddy hugs were received.

Bonus: I am now more proficient at pouring water.[Plastic!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBRquiS1pis)nobody said they werent in it for the money and publicity And all that extra CO2 put into the air from the people runningI can just say that this picture really makes my ocd angry......I am a real stickler for recyclying and littering makes me angry.....pictures like this make my blood boil!","{'Sadness': 0.039109, 'Emotional_Range': 0.77, 'Tentative': 0.011, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.028931, 'Analytical': 0.252, 'Conscientiousness': 0.21, 'Agreeableness': 0.595, 'Joy': 0.120248, 'Disgust': 0.062876, 'Extraversion': 0.597, 'Openness': 0.348, 'Anger': 0.613991}",{'vegetation': 0.964429}

Canada Goose Story:

I have always hated these vile creatures but my hate for them entered a new level one day when I was walking home after a jog on a path along a river. I had spent a good chunk of my jog dodging goose shit which is a common occurance and I come across this goose sitting on the side of the path with his body facing away from me. He is staring over his shoulder in an unblinking fashion so I stare back refusing to lose a staring contest to this bird knowing that since he is facing away from me he is going to have to swing his head around to keep staring at me when I pass him. With my victory all but ensured something terrible happens. Since this arrangement has me starting at this gooses backside I am staring directly towards his asshole while he takes a shit mid staring contest. I couldn't help but look away. Not only did I lose the staring contest to this fucking bird... but he tricked me into staring right at his anus as shit came out of it.

There is no greater crime in this world then having this horrid horrid creature named after our beautiful country.Cheers from America  ^sips ^from ^Tim ^Horton's ^mug

He kind of ran out of places to store it. We had what could have been a pretty lucrative farm on our property, and my dad ran it all mostly himself. Dozens of cows/bulls, a few large chicken coops, the whole deal. And he bulk-ordered salt. A lot of salt.

I'm still not entirely sure what the whole deal with it was. It's not like we could eat it all--between the basement (which was full nearly to the ceiling) and me and my sister's rooms, there had to have been several tons. And he refused to sell it.

They don't want anything but video games and pokemon cards. I try to get them into board games and sports, which they like and play. But, at the end of the season they want a video game as a reward for having worked so hard in their sport. I tried getting them into science and bought them a telescope and microscope and science books, like I had when I was a kid and was fascinated by. They ignored all those things. 
It's video games and pokemon cards, that is all they want. They don't want to ride their bikes. They don't want to play at the park. It's hard to relate to these guys, though I try. I had an NES at their age, but I played it after dark. After I rode my bike to my friend's house and played basketball in the park all day, and went swimming without parental supervision, and after it was dark. And there was no other kids to play with, in my room, I'd play NES games like Zelda and Metroid and Mario for  a couple of hours tops then go to sleep. Video games were a thing I did when there was nothing else to do. Now it's all my kids want to do.You don't see models of battleships and aircraft carriers and tanks on shelves like that anymore.

if someones wondering how the [interior](http://imgur.com/a/lSHbY) is!!

Ah the canals of Kerala. Did that with my SO a couple years ago and it was probably the best deal of my life. We got our own houseboat with a driver, cook and helper for two days and 1 night, all meals in for around $50Looks like it belongs in the Shire. That is badassYes! Alleppey backwaters represent! Oh man. I remember being on one while being on a school trip to kerala, india years ago.
It's pretty cool as there's toilets and bedrooms and all those stuff onboard.
What's pretty cool was that they cooked the fishes from that day's catch on board, so everything was pretty fresh. 

Pretty cool to spend a night in.I did this with a couple buddies back in 2008. They come with different amenities - from bare bones to ones with A/C and satellite TV. My buddies and I didn't see the point of going to a beautiful place like Kerala to watch TV, but we did upgrade to a model with A/C. The onboard cooks made us an amazing meal with fresh fish. Even let us jerry-rig a fishing pole to fish off the side of the boat. We bought fresh fruit at a stand just outside the docks before we left that they cut up for us. Definitely one of my best experiences in India. Would recommend to anybody.The india that is portrayed in movies to the India in south India is really different, especially in a place like kerala, better, different food imo personally, beef eaten in kerala everywhere like staple food etc, etc Is that a tourist thing? Seems too nice and fancy to be an indigenous craft.Indian Family RobinsonI up vote these houseboats every time I see them.

* Any plans for the 4th of July?
* Do you plan on staying in the PR field?
* Best hole-in-the-wall restaurant in NYC?
* Do you own any dogs or cats?Is there any explanation as of why she has been relieved of her duties?

I hope all goes well for /u/chooter. 

*internet hug*Hey, everyone gilding /u/chooter 's (or anyone else's) comments, may I point out that you are paying your hard earned money to the people who just fired her?

Maybe she has somewhere else she'd rather see that money go... a charity or something? Or hold on to it until maybe she has a chance to figure out what she's doing next. She might have a business or project idea that would benefit from a patreon or indiegogo campaign.[Context](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/)
I think Reddit has just about reached the Digg V4 level of stupidity and obstinance. It will probably be all over soon.Her being hired was the single best thing that happened to Reddit since Digg shot themselves in the foot. 

The quality and organization of the AMAs massively increased. They rarely go anywhere near as badly and it seems she did a great job of nicely bridging the gap between celebrities and reddit.

I cannot conceive of a series of events that would make Reddit fire one of their biggest assets. I've got to agree with you, this was a huge mistake.

Wow. I'm just stunned./r/iama and /r/science have gone private to protest this. They can't operate without Victoria's help. 

That's fucking bullshit. Victoria was the lifeblood of one of the better parts of reddit and without her that's pretty well crippled. 

Thanks for everything Victoria. We'll miss you. GO DARK /r/pics!!!!
Join iAMA, science,and movies!!!!I swear to Christ if this is some political bullshit or a harbinger of where Reddit is going, I'm done with this place. 
It isn't like the formula can't be completely duplicated somewhere else, and it isn't like previous forum websites weren't superseded by competitors over time.
Obviously, if she pinned her boss to the floor and railed a line of cocaine off her boss' forehead, this is totally legit. But if she didn't, well, bad call.
Dude, I've got almost the same picture. In fact, /u/beernerd, I think you took it! I definitely agree with you that letting her go is a big mistake. You can't find someone with her personality and work ethic just anywhere. The good thing is that maybe she'll end up somewhere that appreciates her. Seems like reddit corporate never did. Here's to you, Victoria.

http://i.imgur.com/a0qEXzt.jpgThe fact that /u/chooter's account is still around shows that Victoria has abided by site rules.  What is apparent is that the reddit admins have taken a huge shit on her fellow mods and every moderator on reddit who gives up their free time by not warning them that they were not going to be able to function.  They also took a huge shit on all those trying to post AMA's* Step 1: Make /u/chooter mods of all the subs. 

* Step 2: Kick Ellen Pao out

* Step 3: Make Victoria the new CEO of Reddit.

Very fascinating watch.ITT people learning that Iran has plantsTBF Iranians were never quite Afghan in their culture and social norms.

There's to this day a more ""liberal"" urban class in Iranian society. It's actually sorta interesting, how a nominally fundamentalist theocratic top leadership and the rest of Iranian society function and relate to each other.
The Ayatollah and his regime control the country, but they don;t seem to ever have quite enough power to crush out the urban class and their more liberal leanings effectively. They try but the Ayatollah and mullahs rely on the urban class to run things.

Definitely would recommend reading up on Iran, it's a bit more nuanced than how many people view middle-eastern countries. 

(Actually as a side note, most middle-eastern countries are a bit more interesting than usually perceived, would recommend reading up on most of them). 

Also American involvement in the events leading to that state of affairs.

I know / read of some people who had a stroke that affected their ability to speak. In the beginning they could merely speak at all, but after years of therapy they were able to speak quite coherently. Is this because the brain recovers from the stroke and rebuilds some cells?My dad has had mini-strokes over the years. His father passed away after having a stroke.

Today it was [strokes](https://i.imgur.com/KTCteZh.jpg)This is irrelevant but I was really disappointed when I tried to translate your username in morse code, OP. Did they survive having their brain taken out?  Holy cow!This is wicked. When I heard part of the brain died I Just figured it stopped working, not is disappeared. Thanks for the fear.My mom at age 32, had a massive stroke when I was just three days old . She had died a few times on the table but they had brought her back, and stayed in a coma for two weeks. When she came too, she had been paralyzed on the left side, and had a broken tailbone from where medical care had dropped her twice without anyone's knoweldge. Anyways my family always told me when I was younger that my mother was NOT the same person that they knew. She was angry, violent,  easily persuaded, amongst a slew of other things. Now that I'm 21, I currently take care of her, and try to teach or show her things everyday. Even 21 years after, she isn't all there... short term memory loss, not fully intact with reality, poor judgment...  especially while operating a vehicle. Oh, and my mom is pretty much a comedian she literally has no filter on what she says and its hilarious. However she is my mom, my best friend, and I am literally so LUCKY and blessed to have her in my life today. I wonder if you can physically tell that part of your brain is missing? Like can you feel the difference in weight or maybe your head feels... different?I looked at that picture while I was eating olives.

And then I thought to myself: *This is probably what brain tastes like.. a little salty, oily, a semi-rigid with a little spring to it, some fatty nutty flavors...*

*Fuck. What the fuck am I eating right now? Oh god, are those veins?*The cognitive deficiencies following stroke are well documented and understood by those of us that have been affected. I had a stroke following a ruptured brain aneurysm in 2011. Scan showed damage on both sides of my frontal lobe. This is the area of your brain that deals with processing, organizing, planning, etc. Doctors predicted I would not walk again but I overcame that. Sheer stubborness on my part, I think. 

The wonderful news is we know scientifically that, though those neurons and pathways that were affected by the stroke are dead and will not be back, the brain does have the ability to form new neural pathways. So, depending on the extent of damaged areas it is possible to regain some of the losses. It requires exercise of the brain though, just like your physical body requires exercise to build muscle, the brain has to be exercised with brain games that help to rebuild those pathways. 

In the initial months/years following my stroke/brain bleed I had to relearn walking, talking, writing, and numerous activities of daily living. I was determined to be independent though. 

Now I'm 4 years post bleed. My lingering issues are adynamia (which is very depressing and I have to force myself not to dwell on it) and short term memory loss. I'm also epileptic now but that is handled well with meds. 

I find the picture interesting because I would love to be able to visualize the areas of my brain that have died. Maybe having a 3d model of it would be an aide for getting people to understand my remaining issues. 

The brain is an amazing organ, after having a major stroke last year (45 years old) that left me with speech and cognitive difficulties I wasn't sure if that was my new 'normal' or if I would be able to overcome my deficits. After a lot of intense therapy you can't tell that anything happened (unless you catch me when I'm tired or stressed). Plasticity all the way!

Some info:

> [This is commonly referred to as Flame Aura Quartz. These are created by putting quartz under a process called magnetron ionization. What they do is put the quartz in a vacuum chamber and fuse different metals onto the surface of the quartz creating iridescent sheens. In this case, titanium molecules are bonded to the quartz by the natural electrostatic charge of the crystal. The most common that I see around is Aqua Aura Quartz which is quartz that has been treated with gold. Some people do not like them because they are considered man-made.

And here we are on reddit fighting each other and being defensive about being proud of your country and people talking about nationalism. It's possible for different countries and cultures to coexist and it can be fine tuned till we've hit the right balance. A lot of ideas like unity and independence aren't mutually exclusive. Look at America. Vastly different cultures from region to region and many different states yet somehow people manage to coexist together pretty well for the most parts

No other place I have been has as much variety in a small distance as Romania.  I can go from the broad plains of the far western border (jud. Bihor) to ear popping mountains in jud. Cluj within an hour and a half.  If I have the time to travel 800 km. from border to border,  I can even experience a Mediterranean climate at the Black Sea. That's just geography, however.  Our food, culture, language and traditions are just as rich and diverse.Romania's countryside is some of the most beautiful in the world. My wife and I own a campervan and drive around Romania at least once a year. It's breathtaking. 

We even visited 'Borat's village' last year (Glod). If anyone is interested, I can post photos. 

Ohh and Bucharest is crazy cool, too. Moments before being bitten by a vampire (of the sparkly kind, since it's midday) :(Nice try draculaIt's a kind of maaaagic.. I visited Romania for about a week. Most of my time was limited to Constanta, which is a weird place when its cold and all the beach buildings are shuttered up for the season, but I had access to a car for bits here and there and explored what I could.

But it was astounding to me to go from the abandoned Casino Constanta to the Ancient greek ruins of Histria to the ruins on the Medieval Castle at Enisala to grandeur of Peles Royal Castle then to the stunning scenery of Transylvania and of course the infamous Bran Castle.  The shear diversity of scenery and sights was humbled only by the generosity and character of its citizens.  

Romania is very unique and special place, I hope to return at some point. [Queen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p_1QSUsbsM)I've been there twice, once for some caving:

I've always heard of it called a drop-off.Note to everyone. if you ever come across a pool like this, **DO NOT** swim in this water...not only will it kill you, it will hurt the entire time you are dying. This is Black Pool, a hot spring at West Thumb Geyser Basin. One of the more popular ones at this particular basin. Source: Worked at Yellowstone for 4 years.

EDIT: For anyone wondering, the ""drop out"" really is as extreme as it looks in the picture. It gets really deep really fast. This hot spring is probably around 20 feet across, going off memory (haven't been there since 2010). The coloring comes from a combination of dissolved minerals and ""extremophile"" bacteria that can withstand the heat of the near-boiling, highly acidic water. This is my favorite geyser basin in the park because of its beautiful hot springs and mud pots, as well as its location on the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake, which gives it a great view and attracts a lot of wildlife to the area.That, for some reason, is incredibly unnerving.In Oregon many years ago at some random beach my brother and I went in chest high water and about 100 feet in front of us a grey whale came up and scared the crap out of both of us.  It was then that we realized the beach had a big drop out (off?) pretty close to where we were.I just know there is something down there that will try to kill me. No thanks. My first reaction was that it looks so beautiful I someday want to swim there. The comments have now made me aware of my sheltered city life.I don't like this picture. It has no sense of scale. This could have been taken by someone on their knees or from a camera mounted on a drone. That drop could just as easily be 20 inches as it could be 20 feet.Where is this?i'd much rather be a bird than a fishIs that where those pacific rim monsters come from?It sure looks like a good spot to boil some potaters.Interesting to note:  The deepest ocean floors are typically near the shorelines of continents and large land masses.  This is because two sets of tectonic plates connect/collide (this is actually how earthquakes are caused.. two plates push against each other with more and more force until one ""slips"" and rises above the other causing a massive 'shockwave"" so-to-speak) where one tectonic plate stays above the other (to form the landmass), and the other plate submerges/goes below the other.  As a result, land masses form as well as a trench.. I don't think I can explain this as well as a geographer can but most people don't realize that the deepest parts of the ocean are very close to the shoreline!

Edit: [Here is a very basic diagram](http://www.bcscience10.com/images/0_quiz-12.2-03.jpg)I know this is a thermal spring and not a big drop, but it reminded me of a video I saw a while back of an ocean cliff just a few meters beyond knee deep water.  You walk and then the sand ends and the darkest abyss takes your vision.  I didn't know I had a phobia until I saw this video.  The OP's picture resembled an ocean cliff, and my heart rate immediately jumped to fear bpm.  Anyway, this is the video.  Sorry for the shitty link:

Assistant: We only have $20 left in the tortoise budget sir...
Lead Biologist: WE CAN REBUILD HER! SLIGHTLY FASTER!I could see that going downhill very quickly.This happened to one of my tortoises when they were still in my grandmother's garden. My grandmother is 90, and had the tortoise since she was a small child so we're estimating that the tortoise is around the same age - so would have been around 80 at the time.

So they lived in the garden and my grandmother had no idea anything was wrong because she couldn't lift the tortoises/they had a small hutch in their enclosure in the garden where they nested in the evenings. She had seen some rats there before but didn't really think anything would be amiss. My dad was preparing them ready for hibernation at our house at the end of the summer and noticed that she was very ill - huge cuts and wounds under her front two paws. It seemed as if she wasn't making it into the hutch at night - leaving her very exposed to the elements and, evidently, rats. She is a very big tortoise and hence the openings in her shell are also big - definitely big enough for a rat to enter and get under her legs.

Obviously took her to the vet and was told that she was very ill - and there wasn't much chance of survival. Taking the vets' advice, we were ready to go and pick her up after they put her to sleep. However, we got a call from one vet there to say that she felt she hadn't tried enough and wanted to continue. Cue months of medicine, cute pink and blue bandages, dressing her wounds daily and antiseptic-ing her... she ended up being more or less healed, and the scars are now visibly reduced.

After a little house rest, and when the other two tortoises woke up for hibernation, they were reunited and now live in our garden in a more secure enclosure (we have a dog who would love to try some tortoise, unfortunately - but at least it seems pretty rat, cat and anything else proof, too!).Should have given him the rest of the model airplane so he could finally fly. That tortoise could have been alive just as the Wright bro's were doing their first flights in 1903.They see me rolling!If it ends up going down a hill, how does it stop?Well that rats wearing fuckin skid marks now.

This devotional figure dates from circa the 6th century AD and was probably made in Kashmir, on the Pakistan/India border. The Buddha has a silver urna on his forehead, symbolizing the third eye, while the ears have long lobes, the insignia of royalty. He sits in a meditative pose upon a double lotus throne, the latter representing purity. The Buddha probably arrived in Helgo via Swedish merchants whose eastern trade routes were concentrated along Russian rivers such as the Volga.

I wonder what this statue meant/symbolized to its Viking owner. Was it just a trinket? Did he know who Buddha was? What did he trade it for?The earliest I can interact with Sweden as a Buddhist nation is 780ish in Crusader Kings II.Must have come in with the Khajit caravans. It raises the question: how long do you have to wait until 'grave robbing' becomes 'archaeology'?

I like to think that Viking was baller as fuck.

Like anyone that came to visit him had to look at his super-cool statue.  Vikings are cool So cool!If the Devil can go down to Georgia then why can't Buddha go to Sweden?

Is there any sauce for this? i know some reenactors that would foul themselves for more information (in a good way).Does that make this particular viking the oldest historically documented hipster?

A primary rainbow is *always* two degrees wide from where you're standing, and always shows up at 40-42 degrees offset from your shadow (so the sun *has* to be behind you, somewhere).

Now, in this picture, the rainbow is about 2/3 of the height of the cliff face, and the fall is 188 meters.

In that case, you'd have to be ~ four kilometers away, and have a *very* powerful magnification.

But if there's nothing in between you and the fall, you could, technically, get a shot somewhat like this.[deleted]You can also see a [moonbow](http://i.imgur.com/WWqpMAz.jpg) at certain times of the yearCalifornian here... what's that liquid stuff flowing from the top?Sir Ian Mckellen, Niel Patrick Harris, Elton John, and the rest of our highest ranking homosexuals were created this way.There's a place called Rainbow Falls near Mammoth CA.

I'll never forget the crunching sound....and he's all outta bugs.Nigga high as fuckHe's in the land of milk and honey and bugs that fly right into your mouth. Life is sweet.I had 2 lizards that lived in the air conditioning unit in my bedroom. I called them both Steve. The wife hated them.he has a great smile.  That means thanks for leaving the light on so I can snack on the bugs dude!Does he have a name?the rarest of them allI had a family of toads that would sit in front of my porch light and eat the bugs, as well. It was an older frog and 3 baby frogs. I would always go outside to smoke and there they were. They were my smoking buddies. Eventually they all grew up to be about the size of a business card and then left. Now, that the summer is back, I have a new family. The circle of life.We built a walkway/stairs by the side of hour house since people rent the basement and we needed to give them a safe entrence (the hill was impassible during a rain). 

So, to make it as safe as possible, we put LED lights on the thing...the little ""accent"" LEDs that resemble license-plate lights. Mounted about 6 of them under the railing. They're on a timer that lets them run all night.

I used to have about 6 toads that hung out on the porch at night when the light was left on...eating bugs (once, I saw one eat a slug). They'd apparently taken up residence under the porch since the food source was so good. They didn't have to fight or jockey for position..they're too lazy and there was plenty for everyone.

When I stopped hanging out on the porch at night...they all migrated to the walkway where the LED lights attract bugs. Now..when walking from the back yard to the front..I really have to be careful not to step on any...they're all over the place. The big old ones won't jump out of your way...the little ones will...for a while. Then they realize you want nothing to do with them and quickly start getting lazy. They're all getting fat and not leaving, so I assume they're perfectly happy.

The frog population however is just now recovering. We had a cat that had developed a taste for frog legs. Wouldn't even eat the whole frog...just the back legs. Cat has been gone for about 7 years and we're just now starting to have a booming population down in the creek. I've only seen one or two up near the house. Saw one under the porch light of my shack the other night...but as soon as I stepped outside he hopped away. 

The toads...they're more like ""meh, I'm eating, what do you want."" They won't even hop away if you nudge them with your foot, I find myself having to slide them out of the way to get the front door open. Soon as I'm inside and the door is closed...they hop right back where they were.

I like to believe that this is about 3 friends who grew up together and who have known each other their whole lives. Everyday they take the same route and everyday they pass this swingset and everyday one of the workers trembles in fear. His friends take notice one day and ask him what's wrong. ""I'm afraid of swings"" he responds. ""Why"" his friend asks, ""did you have an accident while you were young?"" ""No!"" he exclaimed, ""I just don't like how they're all swingy and shit, aint nobody got no business going that high on no damn swing"". So one day they all stopped at the swingset much to their friends dismay and the friendsgathered around and agreed to overcome their friends fear... together! I like to think that this picture was taken at the very moment their fearful friend mustered up enough courage to take his feet off the ground for the first time as his friends yelled, ""look how high I can go!"".

If you ever need health care in Halifax I'll be sure you get a real saline drip, not the bagged harbour water were usually use!Yep I just show up sick, do a really half-assed job, spread the illness around then go home. The American way.This is the perfect way to deal with that kind of policy.

Calm and understanding tone to maintain rapport. Expose the extra work and problems it causes. Mirror the absurdity by requiring an equally useless piece of work from them. Invoice them for the unnecessary cost. Appeal to the sense of community they (probably unknowingly) betray by outsourcing the cost of their organizational distrust for employees to other businesses.

Great lesson in diplomacy, right here.I do find it kind of silly that companies require a Doctors note if you are sick.

My company does this and I always cringe when I have to tell the employee that policy requires a doctors note if they call in sick more than a day or two.
If someone has the flu, stay the hell home. I don't care, we'll figure shit out.
Sure if you tell me you have a physical injury, I need a note and instructions from your doctor on what you can do when you get back for those who have positions that require physical labour, but if you just had the flu? Stay the hell home, I don't really care.
In the end most of them are paid hourly, if it isn't busy season...you are saving me money.
It's more of a deterrent for people who BS sick days, but it doesn't really work there either. Since they'll find a doctor to fill that stuff out regardless, so you're just wasting everyones time.

My dad used to work in an ER in Nova Scotia. He said it was completely fucked. So many people with very minor issues clogging everything up.Years ago I was a server and the flu hit me while I was working Handling food, drinks, silverware... GM sent me home seeing for himself I was really sick and said don't come in tomorrow. I was supposed to work the following 3 days. I did not show up the next day but by the third I was feeling better and came in. 

The MOD asked for my doctors note. I did not go to the doc nor could I afford the $150 to go to the walk-in clinic. She fired me on the spot leaving the floor short a server. 

The GM called 4 days later asking me WTF? I explained everything to him and he fired the MOD. 

EDIT: GM did not call me 4 days later but 4 days after the initial ""go home you're sick"". 1 day after the firing.Good on that doctor. Fantastic. I remember waiting with my wife in a walk-in clinic for four hours so she could be seen for 2 minutes so she could buy a note from the doctor's office for a flu. Biggest waste of time ever, but her company required itI got written up at an old job for refusing to give them a note. It was worth it to me- I'm not going to the doctor for a migraine, there's nothing they can do, it's just going to cost me more money on top of the money I'm losing by being unable to work.Whats even stranger is friends and family telling me to see a doctor. Its a fucking cold!That's the most Canadian ""fuck you"" I've ever seen. Bravo. Sick notes are for teenagers in high school, not middle aged employees. And they're nonsense anyway. I know what a 24hr stomach virus looks like. I know I don't need a doctor for it. Why the heck should I drag myself to a doctor's office unnecessarily just to appease my company's paranoia.I work in a hospital, and the policy here is essentially ""come in sick or it counts against you"".  Obviously, they don't say that, and they don't want us to work while sick, but they still ding you for calling out (even with a doctor's note).

So, we work around sick patients, which means we're likely to get sick, and we're less likely to call out, so we're likely to make our co-workers sick.  The whole thing is stupid.Instead of asking medical note because of abuse of sick leave benefit, why don't companies hire people they trust? 

If you trust your employees so little that you need to treat them like liars when they call in sick then you need to reconsider your hiring practices.Good for that doctor. I despise the sick note policies that so many companies have.  

I was once so sick with the flu that I genuinely couldn't get out of bed to go see my doctor to get a note, so I went back a couple of days later when I was feeling better to ask her for the note my manager required. I obviously wasn't sick anymore, so she just asked me what dates I was sick and wrote the note accordingly.  

So clearly it doesn't matter if I'm actually sick or not, as long as my doctor will vouch for me. But I have to be a drain on the healthcare system either way. I worked for a retail art supply store, and they brought in a new manager who decided to implement a similar policy of requiring a note if you called in sick.  I told him it cost money and I wasn't going to pay out of pocket for something like that, especially because I had already lost a days wages (no sick days), and was only making $8.50/hour.  He said that I wouldn't be re-imbursed, so I said ""no"".  Nothing more was said. I like the doctors note though, anything which put the responsiblity for such a paternalistic, and wasteful policy back on the employer. 

Its ironic isn't it, an employer generally wants a note to make sure the employee isn't being irresponsible and playing hooky; but the reality is that the request itself is far more irresponsible in its actual effect when you consider the extra strain it puts on the health care system.  

TL; DR= The dr. nailed it.I'm sorry, but screw demanding doctors' notes unless it's an extended illness.

""Oh, you're feeling sick today? NOW YOU MUST GO OUT OF YOUR HOME INSTEAD OF RESTING UP AND PAY A $50 COPAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING SICK.""

How about, if you don't trust your employees enough to believe them when they call in, you're a moron for employing them?I was home due to chicken pox this week and last week.

I work in IT, specifically as a senior DBA. I told them I would be out for 2 weeks but would be fully capable of working from home.

The following happened:

 - Boss required me to bring in a doctor's note with the diagnosis and expected return date.
 - Did not give me permission to work from home (yet made the expectation of such clear)
 - Made it quite clear that, in no uncertain terms, if I didn't have a note, I'd be dismissed for work abandonment.

I informed said boss that so long as I was chewing up sick time, I would not, for any reason what-so-ever, log into the VPN. At no point would I answer any pages nor emergency alerts. I informed him he was welcome to talk to HR / Legal about my stance and who was in the right.

This is the week that the cluster decided to have problems.

I can't wait to tell him that in another week I'm going to be out again for a gall bladder removal.

Like a dimestore hooker without any customers.If my job search is any indication this letter will never get read by any human person and the Dr. will get an automated reply saying ""thank you for applying but the position has already been filled.""Yeah that's bullshit. You're not a fucking child. Funniest part about sick notes is 99% of the time I'm sick because of the poor sanitation policies around your nasty work place.Problem is call centres dont give a fuck. Its an awful place to work the company knows it is so they do this to prevent people from taking stress days and such because not having every possible person on the phones hurts their business. Every call centre says that they are better than the rest but all of them eventually treat you like numbers and not like human beings.The best part here in the states is requiring a note when your company doesnt offer health insurance. Its such a big ""fuck you"" to your employees.

Edit: Just to clarify,

""Pumped to get"" entails being 12 and having one thrown at me out the window of a car by the kid who's mom owned a local toy store. He had boxes full and to be one of the people to catch one was indescribable. It felt like I just got tossed a chunk of gold. I'm just trying to figure out which one's gonna get $14.56 and which one's gonna get the $14.57.This is a really beautiful photograph. It's so raw. These adults seem to have forgotten they are in a courtroom picking their pieces of their broken marriage. 

They look just like children, but all grown up.

And everyone(me included) that made fun of them were mad because they didn't buy them when they could.Just wait till they get to the pokemon cardsNever thought I'd open reddit to see my aunt and uncle on the front page. It is just as embarrassing now as it was then. Buying Beanie Babies on eBay was the most 1999 thing you could possibly doFor the curious, [here's](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/beanie_babies_bubble_economics_and_psychology_of_a_plush_toy_investment.html) the article I found the picture in.Both must cringe at the sight of this now. Man, I know too much about Beanie babies, and it sticks in my head like a steal trap. A few years ago, a girl said to me, ""my birthday is on November 6, and I said to her, you share a birthday with Pouch the Kangaroo."" So, for anyone who doubts what I'm about to say, I think I have the ruinous resume for this.

This collection of Beanies is hilariously terrible. Almost none of these were ever of any value. I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, so it's clear that these two were collecting to strike it rich. They weren't collecting just to have them. I see a lot of Legs the frogs. They had a little bit of value at one point, and when Chocolate the moose retired (which you can see a couple of, it jumped in value a little as well. But they were not big money makers. It's pretty clear to me that these two started collecting late in the Beanie wave, and I wouldn't even be surprised if this were part of why the ended up getting divorced. Most of their retired beanies are from the series that retired just before the most infamous release of beanies ever: Hiss, Iggy, and Rainbow. Rainbow and Iggy were released with their tags switched and body parts all messed about. There were a couple releases of each before Ty got it right. That said, it's pretty clear that she knows what she's doing, and he might be a moron. In her pile in th elower left hand corner, she has a Flip the cat, and (I think though it's hard to say for sure) a Dotty the Dalmation. Those two were pretty valuable after they were retired. Probably the most valuable in this collection presuming that the Lucky the Ladybug sitting in the middle of the pile is a later generation version of the Beanie. Were I trying to select a Beanie in this, I think my next choice from among the middle pile would be Crunch the Shark, though at the time I might have gone for that tye died rooster because it might be a Doodle which was forced to have it's name changed to Strut, and was Doodle for only a very short time. If it's a Doodle, I'm guessing at the time, I'd grab that. If it's a Strut, I'd go for the Crunch the Shark. In the end, Crunch would have been better, but Doodle was what everyone was speculating on.Not even Beanie Baby collectors can stand to be around Beanie Baby collectors.Apparently putting your hand to your face and sticking your finger on your mouth was quite the fad in 1999.I don't even care.  I'll say it.  As a kid who loved stuffed animals, these things were the shit.  There was one for just about any animal you could want.  Played with these things every day till I grew out of them.  Think they're still in a box in a closet somewhere around here.Can you imagine the Judge going home after this?

I'd like to think he was originally [doing the same face as the 3 girls around him*](http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/3-05-2015/XCYDxm.gif), then just as the picture was taken he saw the new intern off camera eating his lunch.Having dated a nurse, his stare is accurate. I respect the profession whole-heartedly, but he has experienced life outside of college and nursing. They're about to clog his facebook newsfeed with someecards about night shifts and the emergency department.

Hey Jon is that your PTSD acting up again?  

""No, just flashbacks of today when Tina said something about Tammy to Casey who incidentally is best friends with Stacy in which and get this, Tammy and her are cousins.""judging by how thin and happy they are, these nurses must have just graduated from schooling and have yet to be a fulltime nurse...I was a US Army Combat Medic, now I'm a nurse. Nursing is the perfect infantry scam.. ""oh you have to wipe butts all day..."" or ""why are you doing women's work?"" No brothers, the scam is this; we get paid a shit ton of money, have job security, get to wear pajamas all day and are surrounded by women. 

We are like Hugh fucking Hefner.. Enjoy your stereotypical ""man job"" at the dick factory. [You should get this for him](http://i.imgur.com/TDdRKXK.jpg)Good for him. Caring profession, not giving a shit about stereotypes. Admirable.[deleted]Those are some smoking hot nurses. He did right I would say. Nurse who happens to be male here. In my experience, despite the ratio being in our favor, you're not generally looked at as a prized or attractive prospect strictly from option disparity. Women ALWAYS have options. Often you're immediately emasculated. Females look at you as a man doing a historically woman's job which makes them wonder why you're there to begin with. Either you're gay - despite not showing any tendencies whatsoever - or you always wanted to be in medicine without the fortitude to become a doctor or maybe you just fell ass backwards into it; none of which coming off as alpha male clap trap. This ends up with you being viewed more as a gay best friend. Even the title 'nurse' commands no masculine respect. Truth is, male nurses live in a fuck ton of friend zones. Generally female nurses are much more interested in attracting the attention of firemen, medics, other docs, that hot shot new attending that just came in, etc. As the saying goes how people generally prefer to fuck up, not down, social status matters; the occasional rn to rn fuck after a work party being the exception. It's more often you'll hear of a male nurse hooking up with aides, secretaries, hr, radiology techs. That said I found the way to overcome these obstacles was to simply become the best i could be in my field. Certifications up the ass, taking the job seriously while keeping things fun and light, offering to help wherever needed, taking and excelling at leadership opportunities, becoming someone that people look to in times of trauma of which there's plenty in the ED. In truth the most sexually rampant period of my life came from my time as a charge nurse, easily topping my college experience. Now working as a traveller and agency RN, i sometimes work in multiple hospitals a week with all new faces and people to get to know which makes you all the more intriguing to the staffers if you don't suck. I am a female RN but my youngest brother is an LPN. He says his nursing school experience was just terrible and working with 99.9% women is less than ideal for him.I'm a male and I've been an RN for about 7 months now.  Out of taking care of hundreds of patients.. only one has had a problem with a male taking care of them.  All the others had nothing but positive things to say about males being in nursing.  When I starting nursing school I used to be afraid to tell people my major due to the negative stigma.  That stigma does not exist and I am now proud to tell people I am a nurse.  Patients, doctors, and other nurses all treat me with the utmost respect.  I am not a male nurse.

I actually stayed there two years ago. There is a small hotel on the island (on the side closest to land, next to the bridge). 

Here are some pictures of the hotel : [Image 1](https://d1p98clqffzjxh.cloudfront.net/lazareto/L13405.jpg). [Image 2](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cc/0f/c7/tower-and-stone-cottage.jpg).

I ran up to the top of the island every day of our stay. There's a church up there, and a couple of lookouts, one of which can be seen in OP's picture (top of the island, closest to land).

What hasn't been mentioned here is that the island and town is pretty much uninhabited - a lot of the building have been restored for historical purposes.

Currently much of the town is closed off to the public - buildings and areas that are open have been converted to tourist shops, bars and hotels. It's a pretty cool place. Perhaps when the restorations are fully complete there will be room for more people to stay in the town.

Without a doubt, my favourite part of Monemvasia is the little enclosed ""pool"" on the side. I couldn't find any great pictures, but here is a [pretty decent one](http://www.mediterranean-cruise-advice.com/images/IMG_0082.jpg), showing the little enclosed natural pool, which curves around and continues beyond the picture. I really enjoyed staying there.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that [in this conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2tupdd/the_hidden_town_of_monemvasia_greece/co2i6zr?context=10000), /u/woohalladoobop points out that the building OP is talking about is a city-owned home for the mayor to live in, and claims that he lived there. I'm calling out his bullshit.

The full comment, as it has since been deleted:
> I actually come from Monemvasia. That house is owned by the city for the mayor to live in. Fun fact: Mayor Spiros Anagna was thrown out of a window over the cliff by some townsfolk in the 1920's after he was caught having an affair with an underage girl who worked at the house.

The house isn't a house, it's a church, named Agia Sofia (pronounced ayia sofia). [Here is a picture](https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/38470106.jpg) of some tourists next to it (not my picture).

EDIT: [Here are some photos that I took](http://imgur.com/a/Qj7xa#0). The last picture is me, and yes, my face is a black box. That is the highest point on the island. Wasn't wearing my running gear that day, since I walked up instead with the rest of the family.

* The stairs that lead you underneath and outside the town walls, to a platform facing the open sea (The Myrtoon Pelagos (pronounced ""Mir-to-on""). People could dive in, the waters are amazing, and there are some steps to help you back up. In the summer, children would joyfully sit on the platform and let the waves wash over them. 
* The view from the center of the town square facing up towards the rock and the steps leading to the top is beautiful, brings to mind something out of a fairytale.
* There are some great coctail bars up there (it helps that I spent my summer there with great friends as well)!

**EDIT: cannot format....This town has an awesome history. For the Crusade buffs out there, when Constantinople was displaced from the Byzantine Empire after the 4th Crusade, many various Crusader kingdoms were carved out from Greece. Monemvasia held out though for the longest time as a pirate town/raiding point and proved to be a headache for the occupying Crusader kingdoms. Even when the entire Peloponnesus was under Crusader control, this one seaside enclave held out. Its amazing.**[Spanakopita!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wgR_4TwHOQ)**

Some people are asking about the local economy. It's mostly tourism. But Peloponisos, the mainland, has a lot of agriculture too. It's one of the greek places that is open for business not only for the summer, like the greek islands, but it's a perfect destination for winter travelling too. Peloponisos is FULL of majestic, amazing places of great beauty and mythological value. It's a REAL shame that we're not doing more stuff with this place :(

Hopefully all these new links hold after DropBox crapped out.Wiki on the Greater Tokyo area http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area 

More people live here than the countries of Canada and Iraq [Reminds me of this picture of Mexico City](http://i.imgur.com/FPO3S59.jpg)I visited Tokyo once, and one thing that stuck with me was how I've read a lot of science fiction that I thought was original, but no, it's just describing Tokyo.  Pretty much everything that's written about a giant city-like planet is really Tokyo inspired.

It definitely made me think about how there are surely some people who have never left that city in their lives, and just what you imagine the rest of the world to be like if you're one of those people.No wonder it's taken Godzilla so long to destroy it.It kind of looks like a sci-fi concept of a planet-wide city.For perspective, [this is the greater Tokyo area superimposed onto the United Kingdom](http://i.imgur.com/Eqfme.jpg)See that EA? This is what Sim City should be about. Let me build (or at least plan and manage) THIS. 

What's so hard about it?  I just essentially need Sim City 3000 on today's hardware. No real 3D is even needed.I live in Tokyo... this is just one direction... If you go to to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitain Government Building, Mori tower, or Tokyo Sky Tree on a clear day, you just see... cement as far as the eye can see. You'll see Kawasaki connect to Yokohama, and then it just fades into the distance. Then you'll see Chiba and Saitama (which we consider the sticks) wall-to-wall with buildings. Then you'll see all the way to Takao-san with nothing but buildings until you get right to the foot of the mountain. It's absolutely insane...

At night it is breathtaking, though.

http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-gigapixel-roppongi-hills-mori-tower/#0.00,0.00,90.0Definitely not as big as Tokyo, but [São Paulo](http://static.theglobalmail.org/cache/37/13/3713345cd59dc2ed9ec915e33f3e5c96.jpg) is also worthy of consideration.Neo-Tokyo is biggerTokyo is literally the population of Canada, in one city.

From this it's easy to find the big landmarks. 

Shinjuku is group of skyscrapers on the left side in the middle, which is said to have the busiest subway station in the world. At the right side of the big green park you find Shibuya, you know the shopping district with the [worlds busiest street crossing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2685/4458168800_2727610646_b.jpg),  and the cluster of ""dark"" skyscrapers, guess they are just being shadowed by a cloud, is just beyond the imperial palace and gardens. 



It is in fact the only city large enough for my mother.  When I was visiting Tokyo I thought I would go out to the bar one night. I never thought about the fact that the trains might stop running at some point. So when I came out of the club at 2-3am, I realized I had to walk back to my hotel. Five hours later, after walking in a straight line, I got there. ### it's a **MEGALOPOLIS!** I think I made something like this in SimCity once. The city barely lasted a week. That traffic must be a blast to drive in I like that one green spot. Like that. That is where I shall live!Awesome shot. It always blows my mind when I see non-US cities (as an American). I think Chicago or Charlotte or LA are huge, but they don't hold a candle to the size of some foreign cities. 

EDIT: 

Been getting some responses that seem to be questioning my inclusion of Charlotte. Please note that I included it because not only do I live here and love this city but I figured size-wise it is about the same as a lot of other American cities with the exception of the big three and would make a good reference point when comparing to non-American cities. 

Here's a pic of Charlotte's downtown:

I went to Tokyo a few years back and it was absolutely amazing.  I was in Shinjuku and it was so nice and clean and beautiful.  I've been to NYC numerous times and it was so dirty, the streets were disgusting, tons of homeless people, just total noise pollution from cars hoking etc.  During my stay in Tokyo, over i think it was 4 days, I heard a total of 3 car honks.  3 Car honks in 4 days.  I can hear 3 car honks in 3 seconds in New York City.  So many international cities just outclass NYC, yet apparently NYC is a pride of our country.  Joe Biden's comments about LaGuardia airport a while back is really a microcosm of NYC as a whole, it's dirty, disgusting, and inefficient.

I did not take this photo!! I found it on /r/newsokur. More people needed to see this.

This seems to be the source! but I am not too sure, anyone speak the language? : http://nurullah.net/article/Keske-Hep-Cocuk-Kalabilsek.htmlI know your pain/amusement all too well. I run a ZF 3D Scanner along side a Leica Total Station for a majority of my projects. I constantly have curios **adults** decide they need to go primal and creep up as close to the devices as possible and stick their nose right in the lens before they ask what the device is.   
Worst part is, their ignorance cause me to have to either resection because they touched the Total Station or have to restart my scanner (really aggravating when you're doing 200+ 6.5 minute scans).  
If it wouldn't complicate my job, I would attach radiation warning signs to it.Survey says...""This is not a camera""I'm 25 and always figured that was a camera...What is it?Those hats are adorable.I was doing work experience with my dad, a land surveyor using this equipment, near a block of flats. My dad had gone to fetch something from the car and left me looking after this ""camera"". A couple minutes pass and a woman approaches me in a sharp tone. ""excuse me?! what do you think you're doing, do you have permission for this?"" 
I was very confused as to what she meant and just kind of stared at her with a confused look, she got more cross and started threatening to call the police. 
luckily my dad arrived while she was yelling at me and asked what the hell was going on. She asked him the same questions does he have permission to do this blah blah blah. He had caught on that she thought this was a camera and not a piece of land surveying equipment and told her that of course he has permission to do this he is surveying the land for the owner. 
She still didn't understand, threatened to call the police because we were ""taking pictures of people in their homes"" and had saw us do so. My dad tried to explain further but she wasn't having any of it. 
Eventually she stormed off. Shortly after the police arrived, my dad explained what had just happened to which they had a good chuckle at the woman's expense and left us to it.

**TL;DR** stupid woman thought me and my dad were using this as a camera, taking photos of people and called the police.I surveyed for years - everyone thinks it's a camera.  When we used to work in the ghetto areas, it'd get exhausting - kids would come up every couple of minutes, ""take my picture!  take my picture!""  - so we'd turn towards them, pretend to press some buttons and tell them okay.  

Another thing - working in the shadier areas - people will try to steal a total station the second you get 4-5' away from it.  They don't even know what it is, nor do they care - they just assume it's some expensive-ass camera.  We'd be talking over two-ways and my rod man would come over the radio with a ""hey, come here and look at this..""  The second you get a few feet from it, inevitably you'd have people start oddly walking up to the total station, all creepy looking.  We'd run back and you'd see them scatter.  That is so fucking cute.I did land surveying in Atlanta for 5 years and the most common phrases I heard were ""Are you guys about to widen the road"" and ""Don't take my picture with that"". People would also duck out of the way like it was a camera.  lol, how cute.....i have been surveying for about 15 years and this is nothing compared to working in the states were there is a good bit of urban development funding in which you find yourself surveying in the ghetto. which means rather than some cute kids wanting their picture taken you have teenage thugs wanting to know wtf i am doing taking picture of the local crack houses. I ran one of these for like 15 years, through school and between gigs.

Legit, every single day I could count on this happening. ""Oh taking pictures, smile!""

YES, BECAUSE THIS TOTAL STATION LOOKS JUST LIKE A CAMERA YOU FUCKING DONKEY HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

Little kids though? Shit man, you just smile and wave. We were once laying out a building foundation next to a Walmart and I guess the Walmart workers were doing some sort of cleaning the streets thing. Anyway they walk up behind my eyeman and one of them asks if he will take their picture. Without even turning around he says, ""It's actually not a camera."" Then she asks again and he turns around and tries his best to be civil says, ""Look this isn't a camera. All it does is measure distances. It doesn't take pictures."" With a leave me alone tone. Had he been paying attention though he would have seen the camera in the woman's hand and wouldn't have looked like an asshole. I just want to point out - for you other surveyors/CE guys out there, is this not an awesome thread?  

Very rarely I get one I can expound on for hours with other dudes that know exacty what the hell I'm talking about!  Civil Engineer here. I have had so many people try to steal this piece of equipment, its just plain silly.
Story time though:
I was once doing a site visit and was staking out distances with a measuring wheel. A gentleman walks up and asks ""how do you ride that thing?"" I replied with ""I clinch my cheeks real tight.""Aw thats adorable!Is this in Poland?  Something about the house in the background.I worked for a company like that once and two teens kept making faces. The guy behind it was easily annoyed and they ticked him off. After a while he said: ""I can't take pictures of you, I don't want to break the camera"". One of the girls ran away crying. I was laughing my ass off.I had no idea there were so many surveyors on reddit.  We need our own subreddit.  Which would probably be the most boring subreddit.Used to annoy the hell out of me when I was working with a surveyor, ""Do you wanna take my picture?"" No, it's a theodolite, it does not take pictures, it measures angles and distances, and even if it WAS a camera, why on earth would I want a picture of you?I have always wanted to know what one actually sees when looking through one of those. 

edit:spellingHa, kids are fucking dumb. Look at those fools. It's like they don't even know what surveying equipment is! Amateurs.ELI5 what do they do with those things?

Link related: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter

Also, I heard a story of a student who was in a class where the teacher allowed students to only write on one side of a sheet. He twisted the sheet and attached it to itself as a Möbius strip.I always loved note-card allowed exams. I thought I was getting one over on the teacher (Hah! I wrote suuuuper small, take that!) but I always ended up learning more of the material because I actually spent time studying by putting together my card.I had a classmate in high school peel the index card apart into layers and then print off typed notes to paste on each layer. The kid ended up with like 5 extra sides on his notes. The teacher was so astounded that a 16 year old would think of this that he allowed the kid to use the note card.  From then on out, that teacher clearly stated that this isn't allowed. Talk about interpretating the rules haha.

PS: Forgive my grammar mishaps (I know its interpreting), as the drunken redneck within me came out last night.My Differential Equations professor always used to say, you may use one piece of paper. If you are creative enough, you can use all 6 sides.When they wear them on each eye the answers pop out in 3DThis kid is going placesWhy the hell aren't they printing a 3x5 notecard in 3 point fonts and bringing reading glasses?Story time:

There was a legend in the math department at my college that a professor allowed students to use an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper full of notes for the final exam.  The only problem was that the prof didn't specify units of measurement so some smart-ass (or possibly genius) student got a hold of a sheet of butcher paper that was 8 1/2 FEET by 11 FEET.  Since the prof hadn't specified units of measurement, he ended up letting the kid use it, but from then on he always made sure to say that an 8 1/2 INCH by 11 INCH sheet of paper could be used for notes on the final.

I will say that your student's method of bending the rules is far more creative and less smartassy than the student in my story.I did something similar, except for a multivariable calculus final. We were allowed both sides of a 5"" × 7"" notecard. So I wrote out my notes first horizontally on the card, then turned the card 90° and wrote in a different color on both sides again.
So long as you use colors that are markedly different and not too dark, it works well.So that kid gets an A for being a genius right?The thing I remember most about these notecard style exams is that most of the stuff I wrote down I ended up remembering just from the act of taking the time to write it.  I ended up just using the card to double-check stuff so I didn't feel I made it in vain.Where was this post a couple days ago? I could have used this on my final.I had a teacher specifically forbid this because she had seen it before. Playing with legos all the time (and hunting for the right color part in a mixed bin) as a kid developed in me the ability to ""blur out"" all colors but the one I'm looking for. I have done this with six colors and no lenses. Works great.THE MITOCHONDRIA IS THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELLThat's some jimmy newton shitAh, but you didn't say they could also use red and blue strips of plastic for filters.  ""A"" for creativity, but abject failure for the crime of NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. My teachers in college said that we could use our books during the exam. Whenever that happened, everyone realized that the exam was going to be so hard that the books wouldn't even be helpful. Sadly to say, this was indeed the case.A teacher once told my class to ""only use a 3 by 5 note card."" My best friend came in with a huge piece of paper made of other papers taped together with most the chapter written on it. The teacher asked what he thought he was doing so my friend explained that she never specified 3 by 5 inches and that his paper was 3 by 5 feet. He said it was still 3 by 5 so he was still following the rules. She let him get away with it but never forgot to say inches after that.","{'Sadness': 0.31355, 'Emotional_Range': 0.713, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.106, 'Fear': 0.783487, 'Analytical': 0.208, 'Conscientiousness': 0.254, 'Agreeableness': 0.6, 'Joy': 0.041794, 'Disgust': 0.938878, 'Extraversion': 0.404, 'Openness': 0.402, 'Anger': 0.826095}",{}

Liverpool has this beautiful gem, the 115 year old [Philharmonic Dining Rooms](http://beerlens.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Philharmonic-Dining-Rooms-990.jpg).Had a few drinks at The Crown a couple years ago. The booths have buttons that call the waitstaff. I think some of them still work, though we were told they get pretty pissed off if you push them. It's also right across the street from that hotel that had the shit bombed out of it in the '60s, which is unfortunate. It's a beautiful place. Seems Peaky Blinders did a good job creating this atmosphere for their set. Looks quite similar. It looks like the pub in Dishonored.Reminds me a little of something out of Peaky Blinders.

Go to Kelly Cellars if you want an old pub; older than the Crown and Wolfe Tone is alleged to have hidden there after the United Irishmen's rebellionPretty sure its the only bar owned by the national trust in order to preserve its awesome look!OK, I'm impressed.

Most cities in the British Isles  have pubs with roots well over 500 years old, some which have been a pub going back to the 13th century and beyond. For example the Victoria in Chester

Having said that, pubs are some of the most fascinating buildings around from a historical perspective, and it's a shame that many of them are going out of business and being pulled down, only to be developed into characterless Tescos and flats etc. Once they're gone they're gone!
It's like the church of drinking.They never tell you this part, they are called ""snugs"" and there main purpose was for the women. The men were free to be seen drinking in the main bar area however women could never been seen in a bar (if they were even allowed in in the first place). If they were traversing from the snug to outside they would cover their head with a vale. This pub must of been forwad thinking or in a very build up area as normally there is only one or two snugs in each bar.You don't see ceilings like that anymore.wow think of all the privacy while doing cocaineAlways felt bad stepping on this to get in http://imgur.com/7JYS9CUWhat is the name of this place?

Last time it did that was probably around 4-6 years ago. **Helpful tips for those that have never driven in snow:**

-don't slam on your brakes (additionally: check your car manual if your car requires brake pumping or not)

-before braking, let up the gas first for about 2 seconds before using the brake pedal

-increase your braking distance significantly compared to dry conditions. You will slide if you attempt to stop at what may seem a reasonable rate normally and lose control (thanks, /u/my_dog_is_cool)

-keep a cars length between you and driver in front of you when stopped

-if you know you are going or about to go over a bridge, don't accelerate or brake unless you need to (bridge ices before road)

-accelerate while going up hills

-don't ever break going up hills

-don't ever use cruise control

-if the light turns green before you approach the intersection (meaning you did not make a full stop yet), proceed with caution (someone from the previous light might still slip in the intersection on accident)

-look both ways when the light turns green before proceeding

-keep the top of your car free of snow (for drivers behind you)

-keep the hood of your car free of snow (for your benefit when that wind blows)

-put your emergency blinkers on the moment you are seriously stuck

-wear sunglasses during the daytime (you'll see outlines of curbs and medians better)

-never use your brights (it's like a million mirrors blinding you)

Somehow that line really struck a chord with me. You never know how much you have until you almost lose it all. ITT: People expect a random bystander to cut this guy out somehow.

http://cdn5.movieclips.com/paramount/t/top-secret-1984/0549550_15137_MC_Tx360.jpgMy prediction is someone will photoshop an angel standing in front with it's arms out pushing each semi to save him. It will be reposted to facebook next week and my mom will show it to me next month. Can anyone figure out how he got in that position? Perpendicular to two parallel semis? As a former firefighter I have seen people live through much worse. I don't have pictures to prove it but it is weird how some people can survive crazy shit. The majority of them where not in great shape but they did live.

The one that I remember most though is a drunk that hit a mini-van head on. This was back in 1989 and the guys head punched through the windshield. The Sgt. went to support his neck and his fingers slid inside his throat. Took us all back for a few seconds and then we went back to the rescue.

Once we removed the dash both of his legs where facing towards his torso and through all this, he was breathing. Not with it, but alive.

He survived though.Like a good neighbor, state farm is therrreee..... with a hacksawhttp://i.imgur.com/ds7nimr.gifvDoes anyone else find it unsettling that there is a skull like face embedded into the crumpled frame just to the right of his face?!So this is actually my cousin, just got off the phone with him. He was coming back from a business trip in Oregon (he's a farmer in Washington) when this happened. According to him there semis in front of him hit black ice, and he then slid into them, crushing him like this. His airbag didn't go off (luckily) and he said he had about 1 ft. of room to move around in. He was able to get out of the car after about 30 minutes. Although he says he only has a couple cuts and a bruise near his eye, he did go to the hospital where he was checked out and everything was fine. He's now happy to be home with his son and pregnant wife.

That is one large pack of menthol cigarets. A random $2 book that has been sitting unsold for a decade and they wanted to get rid of.Every hospital should have one of these.WHERE is this??I'm sure it's filled with stale inventory, unfortunately.If it was well curated, this could be fun.  Poorly curated, it would be lame. I had a roommate/cousin who would always buy random books in bulk and fill our house with them. He'd get somewhere around 10 for $1 and had this idea that he could sell them for money. I am now ashamed to say that up until this day I thought  it was the dumbest Idea I'd ever heard. The books weren't anything special but if you market it well enough, you can come up the product we have here in front of us. I'm sorry James.It's like a slot machine where you always win :)As others have said, this is in a store in Toronto, Monkey Paw

It's a cool concept until you realize you're putting $2 in the machine to come up with a book that is literally so bad that no one would ever buy it off the shelves

The perception is that you get some unique piece of literature that you can cozy up with for a couple hours on a cold night, giving you a smile as you read about something that makes you feel worldly

The reality is that you end up with an obscure economics textbook from uganda written by some grad student that doesn't know what he's talking about, in which case you just throw it in the trashWhat a novel idea!With my luck id get something I already read, and I've read maybe 3 bookslooks like a pack of newports.If you want to see it in action: http://vimeo.com/53679084

The crash occurred a few minutes after takeoff with the plane ditching into Keelung River which flows through the city, an engine flameout was speculated to be the reason. Weather conditions were normal at the time. Since the river is not under normal flight path it seems that the pilot was trying to attempt an emergency landing and to avoid causing serious damage to the buildings. 

Rescuers said that the cabin was flooded to chest height and has a strong smell of gasoline. Many passengers were still in their seats with their seatbelt fastened and unable to escape. Most passengers that are unaccounted for are located at the front of the aircraft which is submerged under the river. Some are also feared to have been thrown out of the cabin when the plane crashed. It's rumoured that a few bodies have floated downstream.

There are 53 passengers including 2 infants and 5 crew members on board. 12 people are still missing while 31 deaths are confirmed and the black box has been found as of 2030 UTC. 31 of the passengers are Chinese. This route is quite popular with Chinese tour groups since there is a ferry service that connects Kinmen to Xiamen which is a low cost alternative for them to visit Taiwan rather than taking the direct flights.

This is the second crash of TransAsia Airways in the past 12 months with another ATR 72 crashing during approach under horrible weather conditions last July. The government has now ordered all 22 ATR 72 aircrafts operated by both TransAsia Airways and UNI Air to be grounded for further inspection. If the aircrafts are grounded for the next few weeks it might cause some serious trouble to people going home for Chinese New Year that is coming up very soon. 

Local newspaper has reported that the aircraft that crashed suffered engine problems during its delivery flight less than a year ago from France and was diverted to Macau to replace an engine. A third-party certification agency has recommended the airline to not the take the delivery of the plane but the suggestion was rejected. The unnamed pilot that was interviewed claims that there are problems with the certification process done by ATR.

(And yes, the majority of cars in Taiwan have dashcams)

 The pilot maneuvered in a way to avoid the buildings in the resident area and I'd like people to acknowledge this, instead of just fixating on the fact that ""A plane crashed"".

The wind will be blowing from the side with all the ice on it and as they freeze they build up. So it's not really driven through the fence. This has to be Wyoming.This is amazing!

Looks like where the money is buried in Fargo.N*ice*. Just give me a six-pack and a baseball bat and I could entertain myself for hours smashing the ice.These remind me of the glass blocks in MinecraftIDK if ""driven through a fence"" is an accurate description. Moisture laden wind was blowing through the fence depositing ice on the cold metal (and later cold ice) surfaces. This is similar to freezing rain during high winds, but it's probably more likely the result of a mist or fog coupled with wind instead of rain.

""Ice driven through a fence"" sounds to me like there was ice buildup on one side of the fence, then high winds for a time period, and the ice was forced through the fence.England: the Land of Wind and Moisture.

> Ok. I think this post warrants a little backround info. Reindeer are not hunted, but while they roam freely for most of the year, they are owned like cattle. The antlers glow only in car headlights so it's not like wolves are scanning the forest with searchlights for flashy reindeer. In addition to danger they pose on the roads as they do not fear vehicles, the herders have an economic incentive to keep the stock alive. If you drive in Lapland you cannot avoid seeing these animals around roadsides in large flocks. They cause traffic jams just by chilling on the road as well. In the wilderness of Lapland there are few street lights and the nights are tremendously long. I mean polar night.

Watching the Thing crawl around was creepy. I was trying to figure out how to get rid of the fucking thing and just watched it crawl for about fifteen minutes. Finally when it got close enough to the door I grabbed my snow shovel, ran up to it, scooped it up and flung it out the door in one quick motion. I bolted to the button to close the garage door. I starred, wide eyed as the door slowly shut hoping the little thing didn't crawl back in. My heart was racing. I was sweating. But the door shut without the return of the bat.

The only unnatural objects in the tank are the sassy duck (couldn't resist) and the gravel (seemed bad to take that from the beach, so I bought and washed some). There is a 1873 pottery manufacturer (Poole Pottery) nearby and in the past they would dump their broken creations into the sea. Over time these get taken by the tide out of Poole, around Brownsea Island and they wash up on a small beach down the coast a bit (Baiter). This has always fascinated me so I've decorated the tank with little bits of broken pottery and smoothed glassware I've found there.

Currently there is also a hermit crab, pagurus prideaux, he usually has a cloak anemone on his shell (together they form a symbiotic relationship), I collect shells from the seafront for him and another small hermit, a 'hairy hermit'. There is also a goby (fish), a common prawn (many more before but I put them back recently), several snails and a few types of anemone including this lovely snakelock.

My SO's father is a marine biologist and they've both given me a lot of help setting this up. I enjoy it as I get to have a little slice of nature in my flat, observe what they do and not experience any of the guilt I always feel when I keep regular pets. This is just a little crabby holiday. If you're tempted to do this, please read up lots first (although there's very limited information available; if it regards the UK, you can pm any me questions) and please never mix caught and store-bought animals - especially if you intend on releasing - you can spread diseases to ecosystem. This only works for me because I'm so close to the sea; I monitor salinity, temperature and how.. happy everyone looks and return animals if the conditions are not right. I love how fascinated visitors to my flat are about the tank!

For anyone concerned: He's a bit pale due to lack of sunlight for his algae, I guess as it is winter so there is even less getting in. Shall invest in daylight bulb or return to the sea :)

 might wanna check your water parameters, your anemone looks unhealthy(white translucent) inverts such as your anemone are very sensitive and if your tank in under a year or two old its not ready to support an anenome. climbing onto the ducks head which is awesome by the way is the anems maybe a way of wanting more light. tanks always cycle even though you pull your water from the ocean there is a cycle time and doesn't necessarily mean that your tank is ready for anemones. CHECK YOUR WATER PARAMETERS ASAP PLS or he might die on ya

Also, good job lady photog.Balloon pilots have a move they call splash and dash.  When flying over water, they bring the balloon down and touch the surface with the basket and then lift off again.  I've only been on one balloon ride and the pilot pulled this off.  It was pretty spiffy.  The thing I appreciate most about hot air balloons is that, despite all the advances in composites and the high tech materials we now have, they haven't really changed in 100 years.

Makes me smile. :) 
Aw fuck my life. Now I gotta go to the pound.I found my dog outside wandering around my apartment complex. I have found several cats as well. But this dog, I was lucky enough to be awake at 2am on the balcony. And I saw this doggy with no collar and asked my boyfriend to go get it. He said no so I called him an asshole, and walked downstairs and got her myself (I've been attacked by stray cats so I'm weary of getting animals by myself...). She came running up to me shaking with happiness, her tail wagging a million miles an hour. She's a great happy little dog. I tried finding owners, no one claimed her. :(  and I couldn't bear leaving miss happy pants in a shelter.

Edit: This is also why I have six cats.Pic One: ""...all right, play it cool, Luke. We'll make it out of this hole. Just don't wag your...goddammit, they're on to us. Look sad. Goddammit, sadder. That's perfect. Now hold"".

OK, I live here in Hong Kong so I can give a little insight here. Hong Kong has the most expensive housing market. To buy a house here you an buy a small mansion in the UK. But to compensate for this, mostly everything else is dirt cheap (public transport, food at the right places and anything else). Here you just have to live with what you've got.More photos of HK apartments by Benny Lam [here](http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/society-for-community-organization-cramped-apartments). The photos were featured alongside others in a 2014 exhibition, called Trapped.

You could buy a mini-Mansion in most states for what he quoted...Whats with the phone? Looks like it's taking up a prime bit of space, and there's a smart phone next to it.Where do you poop? I am HongKonger and I can confirm you there is no exaggeration in this photo. The housing price has been incredibly skyrocketing for last 7 years. It is because HongKong follows the exceptionally low interest rate of USA AND enjoying the influx of China money at the same time!  Chinese governors love to transfer their money to HongKong because it is protected by law in HongKong, and they could get permanent residency by buying properties ( recently canceled though, thank god). How much are they? They bring cash in suitcase and swipe the whole fucking floor at once!! How could the housing price not skyrocketing.   HongKong government has a constant fear that any policy related to China may be considered as an offence to China, therefore they did nothing just watch the things go beyond control. I could not express my anger towards government which do not watch over the welfare of locals but hiding behind the curtain to criticise people being intolerant.

Marilyn Manson is from Ohio where I am also from. I used to work for a pharmacy chain where his dad shopped occasionally. One time he must have been particularly in his element, because he stopped me as I was walking by and said, ""Steelerbuckeye (I was wearing a name tag), I can prove to you in two questions that you're gay.""  Mind you, this was the first time I had ever met the guy.  I had heard who he was and heard that he was a little...zany, I guess you could say.  But I never expected this.

I figured hey, I'll probably never see him again, so why not.  I said, ""Ok...go for it.""  He asked, ""Question 1:  Would you agree that a male hand touching a male penis is gay?""  I replied, ""Yes that does sound like it would fit the definition.""    He said, ""Question 2:  Do you masturbate?""

I was speechless.  It was the ultimate ""dad of Marilyn Manson"" joke.

When they got about this size and their eyes opened, they would leave the nest and go in bushes exploring. In the evening the mom would come back. So there is a chance this cutie isn't abandoned, just exploring. I would pick that cute little fucker up, take him home, and love him until he dies... which would be hours later because I have no idea how to care for a baby squirrel.  I just wanna hug him and squeeze him and feed him alfalfa. Right... Abandoned... that's what he wants you to thinkNot disparaging OP's judgment here but just for future reference:

mother rabbits often leave their babies for hours at a time because mothers are more easily spotted by predators. Many baby rabbits appear ""abandoned"" while the mother is actually hiding nearby. If you find baby rabbits that appear motherless and in need of care, it's far more likely she's watching from a nearby bush and hoping you won't touch her babies anymore.

Same goes for young deer. Mothers often leave them alone while they go forage. A fawn leaves no scent, almost no tracks, and are virtually silent, they're much safer without a six foot tall, smelly mom hanging over their shoulder all the time.

tl:dr - Leave baby rabbits alone. They're fine.

Edit: fawn is the baby deer, not a doe.Nah, he's old enough to be hopping around, though looks like he was either looking to nurse for the evening or really couldn't find his mother. Mothers leave the kits alone except to feed them once a day, the kits are scentless and will not attract predators. They are very good at meeting up with their mother when she starts looking for them to nurse. ALWAYS leave baby rabbits alone when you see them, unless they're in harm's way or thin. This guy looks thin-bellied, indicating he hasn't been fed for the day yet. On the bright side if your buddy did take him to a wildlife center, the kit could survive with syringe feeding. Rabbits younger than three days old won't make it with supplemental feeding alone. They all usually die the third day.Actually rabbits can survive  on their own at like 3 weeks so he could just be a young,  independent bunny who don't need no man.He's so teeny!That rabbit is not abandoned, it's large enough to leave the nest and be on its own, rabbits are not like human infants. If you see a rabbit nest with no adult rabbit around, leave it alone. The mother rabbit will typically only visit the nest a couple times a day to feed the infants, she spends the rest of the time away from the nest so that predators don't find her at the nest.My dog brought me two of them last summer...

:(Are you my mother?  if cuteness had a scale, this guy would be at the top.  You cant find anything cuter than this baby rabbit, you just cant.Animal rehaber here. That bunny is old enough to live on its own. Once they are the size of a lemon they are independent as fuck.

An English Pointer, she was a mascot for the Royal Navy aboard a gunboat before the war broke out. She was used as the ships early warning system- she would bark before anyone could hear the planes approaching. She survived two shipwrecks and helped the survivors find fresh water on a deserted island before they were picked up and transported to Sumatra and imprisoned. From there she was the POW camp mascot and used to help the prisoners by hunting for small animals in the jungle or by stealing fruit for the prisoners from the graves of dead Japanese Officers. The men managed to barter one of her puppies to ensure she was given an official prisoner of war number '81A Gloergoer, Medan'. After the war she was smuggled home to England where she received the Dickens Medal- the animals Victoria Cross for her service. Her medal reads- ""For Gallentry"", ""We Also Serve"". ""For magnificent courage and endurance in Japanese prison camps, which helped maintain morale among her fellow prisoners and also for saving many lives through her intelligence and watchfulness.""The boots on the man seated cross-legged hit hardest for me.

http://bringatrailer.com/2009/01/23/bat-exclusive-amazing-1971-toyota-celica/I had a 2005 Celica GTS for about 6 years. I loved that car. drove great, hardly used gas, had enough power to overtake or merge.  it was incredibly reliable.  

a drunk driver turned it into a tin can on my way home from work.  the entire car was smashed and destroyed... I was pulled out by the Police, without one mark or scratch on me.  they said the car saved my life (I had my seat belt on)

I miss that Celica every day.  it was just such a solid car... never once had a problem.  

oh and the drunk driver civilly sued me and so did her husband under common law...  obviously my Travelers lawyer smashed them, but what a funny country America is...Such a beauty, I lusted after one of these back in the day. The one I really like was the fastback coupe. 

http://gomotors.net/pics/Toyota/toyota-celica-fastback-03.jpgI drove a [1984 Celica](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/997/941/2490470002_large.jpg) in high school, that car was an absloute POS but got me some nice lookin ladies.And now it's a car my girlfriend drives.By todays standards this is a gorgeous looking car but I wonder what the reaction to it was back in 1970 when muscle cars were still being produced in full swing. I have my 94 5 gear Celica and love the hell out of it with almost 250,000 milesSuch a gorgeous car. I remember being 11 in like '93 and going to a Toyota dealership in Denver with my sister to look at a 4-Runner they had. In the showroom they had a brand spanking new White '93 Supra, hood popped open sexiness abound with a crowd of people looking at it. But just behind it was a brand new, yes BRAND NEW [Gold '70 Celica GT](http://assets.blog.hemmings.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/10/ToyotaCelica_700.jpg), it had 75 miles on it, just from driving between the showroom and the service bays every 6 months for 18 years. It caught my eye, I abandoned the Supra, and was gawking at this pristine tiny muscle car looking Toyota. The dealership owner walked up and said why aren't you looking at the Supra like everyone else? I said the Supra was cool I guess, but the Celica was cooler. He smirked. I asked him how much it was, he laughed and said it wasn't for sale, but if it was he'd let it go for $50,000. I wonder if he still has it. The photographer is Dylan Leff and he deserves some credit too: https://www.flickr.com/photos/mojocoggo/  

He makes some fantastic pictures IMO.*Shakes an angry fist*

Slow Down! This is a neighborhood!My 3rd car was a '96 Celica. Best car I've ever had.

I have a Skoda now :(I had a 1978 Celica for a few years in good condition and it was a lot of fun and turned some heads.  A lot of people did mistake it as a weird looking Mustang.

[pic](http://i.imgur.com/N8jFbDD.jpg)I just want to say that's one motherfucking impressive photo.Always loved that specific car.

Always thought [my Corona wagon](http://i.imgur.com/xgnjq.jpg) looked like the Celica's nerdy older brother.Wow. Nice lines. I had no idea. My first car was an '84 celica GT. Actually my dad bought it a couple months before i was legal. When i hit 16 i managed to get him to let me take it out with my friends. I totaled it. He came to tow it - i was certain he would total me. He silently hitched it up. On the way home he finally says, ""so, what do you think of the car you just bought."" He charged me 1500 for it, more than my savings, and gave me 30 days to deal with the wreck. I never got on with my gearhead dad. He offered to rebuild it with me. Short story, at the age of 16 i reluctantly tore an '84 celica down to the block, learned a ton about mechanics (and body work), and finally had a way to communicate with my dad. Funny thing. I know there is no way he planed something like this, of course. And without this event, i can't see how we would have ever related. (He's an engineer, im an English professor)Modern cars are a little depressing.Mmmmm dem Advan Oni wheels.

So impressive. I just hope the various breeding programs have the desired effect.[Possibly even less at this point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_leopard)

A count was taken in 07 that seems to give you this 40 number people commonly use when they pop up on reddit.  

Let's face it, considering how valuable their fur is, at this point there are less than 20 in the wild on their way to being artificially kept around.Well now I have seen oneHelp out with OP's story.
You are correct with the less than 40 left statement, but do you know how far off you were? There are between 19 and 26 left alive, their natural habitat is all of the Koreas, and some of south-eastern China. (Yes, that includes North Korea. I know, surprising that something actually can leave at will)
The species is estimated to go extinct within the next 10-20 years.Fewer than 40 remain. IIRC they mostly exist in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.2 of them at my zoo locally. A male and a female, who happen to have very loud, disturbing sex all the time. Sadly I think they are not part of a breeding program, so no babies forthcoming. 

They are beautiful creatures though, always sad to hear how badly they are doing in the wild.

Edit: Although it'd be more beautiful to see this majestic beast roaming it's own kingdom. It's a tragedy they are in such peril.That is one beautiful animalThey also live about 5 years longer in captivity than in the wild. Until control  over hunters is established, they are probably better off in captivity.Too bad most of humanity doesn't give a fuck.

Also, this is one of the ""oh boo hoo"" topics. Most of you will be interested and ""boo hoo sad"", but as soon as you close this web page you will forget about it. Simply because many people have their own problems, and can't/don't want to/don't have time to care.

He whispered to me in the same way (I'm a dude though). 

Joe, two of his sons and part of his campaign team were all finishing up dinner at the same restaurant where my then fiancee and I were eating. As we walked out, we waved, and he invited us over. Joe introduced us one-by-one to his entire group, shot the shit with my fiancee and I for a good 10 minutes. Nothing about politics, just shooting the shit. 

After part of it, he pulled me aside and gave me the whisper. ""Your fiancee is much better looking than you.""

Wait, what?

""I'm in the same boat, Jill is way better looking than me. I married up. You need to marry up, OP. Don't let her figure it out.""

When it comes to being a public figure, a real politician, this dude is a fucking PRO. Despite his reputation for putting his foot in his mouth, he's one of the most charming human beings my (now wife, of course) and I have met. For about 15 minutes at some random restaurant in Davenport, Iowa, my wife and I were the center of Joe's attention (and his family/team). He was all but out of the caucus polling at that point, our votes were meaningless to him by then, yet he was gracious and genuine and friendly -- and totally 1000% right about my future wife.

A few years ago, a winter storm blew through NE Arkansas and started icing up our dish on the roof. Since I was running the board for a Cardinals baseball game, I had to make sure the ice didn't interfere with the signal. Every hour or so I would go to the roof and smash ice with a $2 mop. 

Afterwards, my boss insisted I stay overnight and keep the signal clear. So I did. Stayed until 4 and made sure we stayed strong.

Also, there was fog like this when I was in Hong Kong but it felt a lot more like it was caused by the heat and humidity than it was by pollution. Not saying there wasn't a lot of pollution though. We have hazy days like this in the hottest parts of summer in Chicago as well all the time.This is Hong Kong not mainland China. See all that grey shit? That's fog. Yeah it's real as hell and guess what? The city really is as beautiful as in the picture. 

tl;dr think San Francisco not LAHong Kong doesn't normally look like that. The weather is usually beautiful![deleted]Now take a look at all this similar ""pollution"" in [San Francisco](https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/rain-san-francisco.jpg)Reminds me of this: http://media.pointblog.se/UserImages/SE/BlogPostImages/100005853/0241253c7eff463e81f57a377d9cbf19_100005853.jpg_600x600.jpgThat could be fog. I've been there a few times and they had heavy fog pulling in the harbor. Made mooring to a buoy a bitch...Hong Kong is actually breathtaking though. Coming from a western culture and seeing that for the first time... It's so beautiful. Fuuuuck this. I have been living in Hong Kong for my entire life. It's not like this 99% of the time. This is incredibly misleading. That's mist, not pollution. She's just going to put enough shitty instagram filters on it anyways that it will end up like the real background 3rd time I've seen this here today. Think it's time for a nap. The skyline in the picture and actual skyline look completely different...?[I found a picture of Hong Kong aswell!](https://www.google.com/search?q=Hong+Kong&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=zTrFVNmBJsTmsATO1YKYCw&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw&biw=950&bih=974)The technology they have over there is unbelievable wow..looks really foggy/smoggy.

It was built in 1978, per [this 1988 LA Times article](http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-15/business/fi-426_1_commercial-shooting).[Streetview Link](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0028027,-117.9365362,3a,75y,170.4h,80.22t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s1aBqbWdzh8vnqI_HuDC3YA!2e0!6m1!1e1)Worked for Mcdonalds in London , at their corporate headquarters in Finchley. They had a mcd's just for employees and would have new items long before everyone else, also items from around the world. Was pretty cool.Fortified for the McZombie apocalypse.The only McDonald's on Earth that makes the food like the pictures.I worked on a commercial there a few years ago. It basically is a fully set up franchise without any workers.  It eve has a fully functional kitchen.  

I was told they also use the place as a practical location to test new cooking techniques and machinery before pushing them out to their franchisees. We must live really close by cause it's by my house too and I have shots when they were filming there! http://imgur.com/a/rnTjdThere is also at least one ""fake"" McDonalds that is the opposite of this one - a fully functional McDonalds inside an unmarked warehouse in Rosemont, IL.

McD's uses this to test out new recipes, products, and technologies. They're not testing for taste in this environment - they're testing how well that stuff will integrate into a simulated ""lunch hour rush"" environment. They're very sensitive to how well it fits into the ""workflow"" of standard McDonalds order processing, something they have spent years refining. 

They are *very* sensitive to anything that will add or subtract even a few seconds from a standard ordering experience. Doubly so because individual McD's franchise owners can simply decide not to sell any individual McD's product if they deem it to be too much of a pain in the ass.

The ""functional test"" McD's works like this:

1. Temp workers line up to pose as ""customers.""
2. A machine prints out order slips at specific intervals, to simulate things that might be ordered in a ""real"" lunch hour. If you are the next temp worker in line, you take that slip and go up to the fake counter.
3. The ""customer"" orders the stuff on the slip, and pays for it with a fake credit card or with fake paper money they are issued. Again, they're trying to simulate every aspect of a real order transaction here.
4. The McD counter/kitchen workers (who are on loan from a local ""real"" McDonalds) rings them up and they prepare their order with actual food (well, as close as McD's gets to ""real food"")
5. The fake customer gets their food order, dumps it into a dumpster, and gets back in line for another order slip.

Source: I worked for a company whose technology was evaluated by McDonald's in this environment and I spent a number of days assisting with our product's trial there during the simulated lunch rushes.

Edit to answer some common questions: For whatever it's worth, this experience was 10+ years ago. Not sure how things have changed since then. At the time, the extra food was not donated to charity for ""liability reasons."" Again, that was 10+ years ago, maybe something's changed. Employees *were* allowed to eat the food. (The wrapped, prepared food was placed into a cart that was occasionally emptied. The cart itself was clean so you weren't literally eating out of a dumpster or anything, though their employees did jokingly call it ""dumpster diving"" if they ate something from the cart)you live near the city of industry in california? because there's a mcdonalds there that does the same thingWhat does the sign on the gate say?? Inside it lives a family of young, upper-middle class light-skinned black people. How close is the nearest actually operating McDonalds?Thats like having a house purely for taking selfies in.Assuming it doesn't have a functioning kitchen, they have to bring in take out, from another McDonald's for the commercials.Some interesting information on it over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2ha824/til_there_is_a_fake_mcdonalds_used_only_for/ckquqy6).FOR COMMERCIAL USE ONLYSo it's for...commercial use only?

I'll see myself out. Do they ever film inside it, or are they just shooting the exterior?Reminds me of [Los Angeles Plays Itself](http://www.amazon.com/Angeles-Plays-Itself-Encke-King/dp/B00LOFYBP0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1418602866&sr=8-1&keywords=los+angeles+plays+itself)

I was driving by it one time and I saw a hummer limo pulling pulling up to it, being curious I parked across the street so I could see who it was. It turned out it was Shaquille O'neal . Apparently he was filming a commercial for the Big Mac. I went over and asked for a picture, but his assistant or manager told him that he didn't have time. Shaq was really cool about it and apologized.

The car was built by [Bob Petersen Engineering](http://www.bobpetersenengineering.co.uk) in the UK (who also built [""Brutus"" and the ""P45""](http://www.bobpetersenengineering.co.uk/#!top-gear/c8rz) that some Top Gear fans might remember.

How drab life must have been back then./r/colorizationLooking at pictures from the past colorized to such perfection is honestly astounding.

Why does every recolored photo look like that.  Like the colors are just a little... off. Everything is a little dull and washed out/faded. Is it done on purpose to make the photo look older?[deleted]I like to look at old street pictures like this and see how many people I can find without a hat on.The reflection of the taxi cab in the window is more *yellow* than the same one on the street. 

This is a fantastic photo, great job!First thing I noticed was how well people casually dressed... suits and dresses everywhere!i bet those streetcars worked perfectly. The one they currently have on H street hits both cars and pedestriansThe car in the bottom right is gorgeous Thanks.

I fled, hold me. Bring me to my master Zonino, you will receive a solidus.

 A slave might be forced to wear an iron collar with an inscription or a tag promising a reward if after running away he was returned to his owner. Those who tried to escape repeatedly could be branded in the forehead, often with the letter F for fugitivus (fugitive). About 36 collars survived to our times. 

http://museum-of-artifacts.tumblr.com/I think what's most interesting is the wearer of that collar likely died with it on.When I see objects like this, I pause and think about how phenomenally lucky I am, that I haven't grown up in a situation where I could be dragged back to an abusive man who *owned* me all because somebody saw me wearing an iron *collar* around my neck promising a reward if they completely fucked me over.

Holy shit. Imagine if you made it miles. Or even hundreds of miles away and you begged a blacksmith to strike this foul burden from your neck & instead he grabbed you & dragged you screaming back to the shit hole you spent your entire life trying to escape.At least this slave collar didn't explode. And thus, the escort quest was born.The flip side reads ""Offer expires 12/31/315.  All taxes are the responsibility of the redeemer.  This collar may not be used for advertising, promotion (including contests or sweepstakes), or other trade or commercial purposes without the express written consent of Zoninus, Inc.""The burning question is: Did they find this intact on a skeleton? How do we know it was for people and not a dog who liked to have adventures?I think the creepy thing is that the collar is still intact which makes me think whoever wore it died with it on.Ahhhh.... nope. Brush up on your Latin.
It says: ""I visited the Colosseum, and all I got was this crappy necklace.""Wow, is that riveted?I don't know this Zoninus guy, but he sounds like an asshole.Reminds me of those electronic collars put on slaves in Fallout New VegasI feel the same way.

http://www.directtextbook.com/large/1429295163.jpgI have been lucky enough to have seen a few of these and it is always quite interesting to see, this one is similarly interesting.

Not just because it is white, but look out the pattern on the shell, it is slightly asymmetric on each side- this seems quite common in albino/leucistic turtles. Compare the patterns on this [leucistic adult](http://i.imgur.com/baz0Zbe.jpg) with the [symmetry of this drawing](http://i.imgur.com/8lx9tTq.gif).

Scute variation is interesting, about 15% of hatchlings that escape the nest have this variation, but about 50% of the ones that don't manage to escape have weird scutes.

Okay so it's white AND weird scutes! Doomed!

Oddly the albinos seem to have an *advantage* at the beginning of their lives, I don't know if it is that obvious in this picture but they are often **LARGER** than regular colored hatchlings. Bigger hatchlings can run faster, swim faster and often avoid getting eaten by things ~~with things~~ with slightly smaller mouths, reducing the number of predators that can swallow them.

They are like super turtles, running and dodging being eaten.

Unfortunately it seems that any advantage of being bigger during hatching and reaching the sea is overshadowed by the disadvantages during the rest of their journey as you see quite a few albino/leucistic hatchlings, but very few albino/leucistic adults.

And yes, I think that pink thing is probably its liddle brain. Good luck little fella!

Edit: Fucking english maaaan, one day I will get it right.""God this neighborhood has really gone to shit""I was working out at sea and I saw an albino fish flapping about in the water, it was an amazing moment, I felt like I was one of those old fishermen who claimed to see mermaids etc. I say to my boss ""look at that albino fish!""

Evolution is a bitch sometimes. Although very interesting, the albino turtle pictured here faces an extremely arduous and unfavorable life.  Turtles often use pigmentation to differentiate friend from foe.  Since the albino turtle is completely unrecognizable to them it will almost certainly become an outcast.

The biggest question of the new Star Wars film for me is whether I'm going to like seeing Luke and Leia all old and scruffy-looking.

I feel like I'm either going to hate it or think it's the best thing in cinema since sound.JJ is not going to pleased to see that you leaked production shots...I work in downtown and didn't know comicon was going on Friday.

There were slightly more overweight Wolverines than usual. This is how I picture them in Star Wars 7.Plain and simple: They are awesome.

Why did you have to take the picture surreptitiously? I'm sure that they would have posed for a pic if you had just asked them.Corellian blood stripes are on point.As someone who grew up during the era in which Star Wars was birthed, I can still recall the spark of wonder of first seeing the TV ads for it for the first time. 

I see it now and my heart almost breaks, we were all so very young then. When I see this picture it reminds me of how much time has passed and how my heroes of old are now fading along with myself. 

I've grown used to the man in the mirror, but I feel a pain of heart when I see images of how the cast has aged. I'm sure the new Star Wars will be an emotional experience for me, I just hope it's not a cruel one. If I didn't know any better, I would say that was Harrison Ford.They put space balls at the bottom of the walker.These are my best friends parents! Awesome people.ECCC effin rules, best weekend I've had in a long time, seeing all sorts of interesting cosplay. 

In particular, I saw a lady in a wheelchair who put a Tardis canopy up around it....That was also cool, in the sort of ""eff you universe and your opinion, ANYBODY can cosplay!"" sort of way. :) Hot daddy.Wouldn't be surprised if that's how they look in Episode 7Just in case you hadn't seen it, this guy has some amazing Up/Star Wars art. Was instantly reminded of it.

They had to dig up a ton of land and fill is with different layers of sand and dirt to help stabilize the foundation. After that, they built a moat around the land to keep a constant level of moisture in the ground to stabilize the bending and twisting the land went through due to fluctuations in moisture.

Without that foundation, this thing would have been a pile of rubble ages ago.[deleted]Definitely the highlight of my visit to Cambodia, the place is freaking immense.

I think there is something symbolic about the gentleman on the right.  You see the ""before"" picture, and he has his collar unbottoned, spread out across his vest thing.

After picture has him with collar done up, tie in place, looking prim, collected.  Most of all though, its as though he is saying; ""There is no more time to be a teenager now.  It is time to grow up in order to deal with all these grown up problems I will now deal with for the rest of my life.""

A similar sentiment to the gentleman on the left whom is not (in that picture at least) attempting to maintain a status-quo overly fashionable hairstyle any longer.Did you hear that?

It's AMAZING how many naive - and looking-for-a-reason-to-be-angry - people are out there. I'm sorry to disappoint BUT

1. The book is SATIRE and pure fun. Sorry. It's a byproduct of a 2009 Toastmasters Humorous contest speech. I took parts of the speech (Chapter 3) and than came up with Subway swagger secrets, where to meet the tourists, how to meet the subway moms (carry baby strollers up the stairs), etc. and just had fun creating new ways ""to meet women on the subway"". 

2. The amazon reviews are real - but written by friends who I asked to write reviews (and...?). 

3. Today's photo was NOT staged. I have no idea who the guy was however I'm happy to take the publicity

4. I'm recommending the book as a GIFT for friends, co workers, HR manager, etc. however many of you need it for YOURSELF - a good laugh to release all that pent up anger. Go to www.howtomeetwomenonthesubway.com and here's the speech that kicked off the book https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2j4QVADs18Here is [the book](http://www.howtomeetwomenonthesubway.com/).

These weren't the norm. They were part of the ""educational series's"" of silver certificate notes. They showcased American innovation and inventors. Originally they planned all denominations of it, but the styling was confusing (small numbers and too much going on to determine the demonimation at first glance to tellers and normal people). They made 1 through 5, as someone already posted. The 5 dollar was controversial because of the exposed breast and there was some backlash.

I'd like to paint that over entirely and put ""This post is not in the middle of the sign.""""Nah, just take the 2x4 and attach it anywhere.""This reminds me of when i was young and dumb, i guess around twelve. Me and my brother used to have our friends over and build deathtraps to race down the steep hill on our street. My friends and i had an old lawnmower where the engine had been replaced with a car seat, behind it a two-wheeled wagoon with another seat was attached, the person on the wagoon used the lawnmowers handle to steer, this person was crucial since the hill had a 90 degree turn half way down. 
My brother on the other hand had a large three wheeler where the handlebar and frontwheel had been made longer like a chopper, thus the pedals on the front Wheels where to far away for our legs to reach, which was good because they spun so fast by the time you were nearing the end of the hill you could break the Bones in your feet. Problem was that it was now Much harder to steer. The hill was roughly 600 feet long and where it turned there was a gigantic ditch with the bottom lined with trees.

We lost wheels mid-race, handlebars broke off, the seats came off and pretty much everything that could go wrong went wrong one time or another. We never broke anything strangely enough, cuts and bruises though, we had those in abundance.

No real point of this story other than to confirm kids are dumb and the sign is pretty accurate.

fun story: the white alligator was not albino; it had a different condition, called leucism, with the same result. pamphlets were given out at the exhibit explaining this, and I took one to my 5th grade class the next day. before class started, my teacher kept saying the alligator was albino, but I told her that wasn't quite right, but she wouldn't listen. She asked me to read the pamphlet aloud to the class anyway. So I read the explanation of the alligator's condition, how it's called leucism, basically causes them to not have pigment cells, blah blah therefore the animal is white. Teacher chimes in, ""yeah, that's albino."" to the entire class, then tells me to keep reading. 

The next sentence I read is, word for word, ""albino animals, on the other hand, have pigment cells that don't work."" teacher jumps up, grabs the pamphlet out of my hand, reads it to see that I'm not lying about what it says, then tells me that's enough and to sit down.

Tanning will affect it, but it'll be better than the scarring.

Skin sagging/movement will not affect this tattoo. It isn't a ""design"" and therefore can't be deformed.

Age breaks down ink. In several months to a few years, lighter colors degrade. Especially in high wear areas or those exposed to a lot of UV light (like the face). That coupled with the skin composition itself WILL result in splotchey degradation on the face. But again, it's not a design. Even splotchey fading will yield a better cosmetic appearance and only degraded areas need touched up.

Much cosmetic tattooing (lips/eyeliner/brows/ice cream cones) on the face fade faster due to everything from light exposure to skin composition, moisture and exfoliation. 

TL;DR it's semi-permanent cosmetics that leave the client better than they started. [deleted]The first time I actually applaud facial tattoos.

Reminds me of the guy who tattoos very realistic nipples on women who have had breast cancer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT2yPfocqfQMy sister has tattoos that cover various scars. She said that in her shoulder the needle broke up a lot of scar tissue, and she regained some of her range of motion. I wonder if it helps to reduce scar tissue in their face too.

[[Picture]](http://www.girlpower.it/pictures/20100606/julia-gnuse.jpeg)That's pretty sweet. What happened when she gets a tan?This is an awesome idea. My friend just survived a car accident and has 2nd degree burns covering a good portion of her right cheek and head. She was worried about the scarring. I'll have to show her this.I read about this a couple days ago, but hadn't seen a picture. Awesome!THIS IS AWESOME.  Cosmetic tattooing is a seriously underappreciated art.  I'm curious as to how well the skin will hold the color over timeThat would be so painful though. Amazing work, either way.Looks better than plastic surgery, and it's a painful experience that' worth the result. Why isn't that technique used as a proper restorative cosmetic procedure. Plastic surgeons make too much money these days, it's time they learned a thing or two about tattooing.","{'Sadness': 0.074946, 'Emotional_Range': 0.844, 'Tentative': 0.749, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.461426, 'Analytical': 0.185, 'Conscientiousness': 0.142, 'Agreeableness': 0.483, 'Joy': 0.050822, 'Disgust': 0.178346, 'Extraversion': 0.692, 'Openness': 0.404, 'Anger': 0.645021}","{'portrait': 0.425557, 'person': 0.999089, 'eyes': 0.475021}"

A drunk guy drove in the tunnel and suddenly appeared at the station. Yes, he drove on the tracks. It's unknown how he did that as of now. He possibly confused the tracks for the road at some point. He drove 800 meters on the tracks.



There was a 5 hour delay in the train traffic and the damages are estimated to be around 3000 Euros.

A quick google map view (https://www.google.com/maps/@51.475462,7.435486,3a,75y,348.06h,69.69t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s5G4OvessrGKF_HsJjdgyAA!2e0) shows you that it is very much possible to mistake the tracks as street. (you drive straight but the road only goes left or right while the tracks continue)
Though he would have to drive two stations to get there :/

Same thing from the other site but than he would have to driven on the tracks in reverse. (since the front is in direction of the inner city)

edit: a quick look into the article shows that this is indeed how he did it. Drove on the tracks for two stations and stopped in the third...He was probably running from a 4 star cop chase. Everyone knows you always lose em in the tunnelsIt's germany. 



Give them ten minutes and everything will be fixed.



 I saw a dude drop dead of a heart attack in Fraport once. Within thirty seconds a police officer was helping, within three minutes medics were there, and within a half hour the poor guy was being wheeled away and everything was back to normal. Seconds after the cop arrived some staff erected a plastic sheet for privacy. The whole thing went down with extraordinary precision. It's a very efficient country.

Because people like him have to be expected, grooved rails are sometimes used (although they are more supposed to allow entry for construction vehicles). If grooved rails were used, this subject would not have gotten stuck and blocked the traffic.

It appears, that the rail line in this case is running as a light rail that then proceeds into a tunnel. The portals of such tunnels are usually open and allow entry for cars.

Now they just let women do it.and I'm still not any closer to finding out what gender peppermint patty isIt never occurred to me that actual people voiced the Peanut's. Where's Fergie?Here is an interesting article on some of the voice actors from [Peanuts.](https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/meet-the--peanuts--voices-charlie-brown-lucy-203240303.html) I think it's funny that Peppermint Patty was played by a boy for a bit. He was a bit embarrassed by it.What was this for? I mean, there were several Peanuts specials in the 60's that used these kids for the voices....like _Merry Christmas Charlie Brown_ and _It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown_. Both of which I suppose could have been voiced by the same kids. But what about afterwards? Like in the 70's and 80's for Met Life commercials and other specials? They couldn't have been using the same kids. Yet the voices...to me....didn't change much. 

Who did the later voices?Interesting. For some reason I always thought they were adult voices. Don't know why. What do they look like now?Oh man! These old RCA studios are so cool. Those wall panels and the designs were modular and built in kits.Not really relevant to the post, but these videos are my first thought upon seeing the Peanuts. My poor, tainted childhood...

He had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper’s cemetery in the back country. As I was not familiar with the backwoods, I got lost.

   
I finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. There were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch. I felt bad and apologized to the men for being late. I went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. I didn’t know what else to do, so I started to play.   


The workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. I played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. I played like I’ve never played before for this homeless man.   
And as I played ‘Amazing Grace,’ the workers began to weep. They wept, I wept, we all wept together. When I finished I packed up my guitar and started for my car. Though my head hung low, my heart was full.
As I opened the door to my car, I heard one of the workers say, “I never seen nothin’ like that before and I’ve been putting in septic tanks for twenty years[.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1coebi/i_played_for_a_homeless_mans_funeral/)”They're taking our jobs!Does anyone know what time it is?What does this have to do with oil rigs?

as for why they're protesting, here is my explanation: Essentially, for the past several years the police, firefighters, bus drivers etc. Have foregone raises in their salaries to get a better pension plan where the city pays more (70%-30%). Both parties agreed to this, but then the city took money from their pension fund to do other stuff. Now they don't want to put it back, partially because their investments fell through. They want the workers to pay extra retroactively to replenish the pension fund. Regardless of what people's opinions on the city workers is, to me it's not an issue of if they deserve good pensions or raises or whatever, the issue is that the city stole money from them and doesn't want to give it back.You have the right to remain *fabulous!*I don't know what ""job concerns"" they're protesting, and I don't know if they're for or against said concerns, but I love the gesture.

Cost me an extra 90 minutes to get to work.

I hate how here, protesting something always means fucking over the commuters.Most of them are wearing camo-print military looking pants - which lends an added air of douche-baggery to their uniform. Coupled with red ball caps its a fratboy meets paramilitary style.

If I lived near one I'd probably do this too, it would be annoying as fuck to constantly be pulled over by the cops just for driving through an area.Since I have the googles, I thought it was interesting to look up the laws he quotes, [this one in particular.](http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/318.14)

It looks like by saying he refuses to sign, according to 318.14, he's simply granting the officer the optin to write him another ticket.

""(3) Any person who willfully refuses to accept and sign a summons as provided in subsection (2) commits a misdemeanor of the second degree.""

They post DUI checkpoint locations ahead if time in the city newspaper that college kids never read. Whenever I hear of police overreach I think of a case from my home country Germany where a police officer got shot during an illegal no-knock raid, and the shooter (a member of a bike gang) was acquitted of all charges. The judge found that it is only natural that the man feared for his life when his door got knocked down without any warning.

[I can't find any English sources on this, but here is at least a good German one.](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/polizist-erschossen-bgh-spricht-hells-angel-frei-11516279.html)

In 2010 Hells Angels member shot the officer through his bedroom door. Because the police did not announce itself, the court found that the man acted in justifiable ""putative self-defense"" - he assumed that criminals (such as a rival gang) were raiding him, and could not possibly have known otherwise. Given the sudden and no doubt threatening situation the court found it unreasonable to demand any warnings from him.One of the pros to living in Rhode Island. No DUI checkpoints. Rights exist for a reason.  They have nothing to do with ""being a dick"".

Oh its a DUI checkpoint? Fuck them. Checkpoints should be unconstitutional anyways.I grew up in the midst of the Cold War. 

We were taught in school that the reason we were fighting the Cold War was because in 'those' evil countries the cops were allowed to stop and search people on the street or pull people over for no reason, break down peoples doors at the slightest pretext, tap their phones and read their mails. Those evil countries had tanks rolling in the streets to frighten and subdue the people!

We were taught that *all the above were Un-American Activities* and we were the great country that was going to put a stop to it at any means, especially to prevent it's spread here. 

Now you tell me- did we lose the Cold War or not? It sure looks like we did.Cop's response: ""I think I smell weed.""","{'Sadness': 0.040169, 'Emotional_Range': 0.886, 'Tentative': 0.561, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.997859, 'Analytical': 0.445, 'Conscientiousness': 0.051, 'Agreeableness': 0.412, 'Joy': 0.033133, 'Disgust': 0.478303, 'Extraversion': 0.549, 'Openness': 0.391, 'Anger': 0.998027}",{'quote': 0.524979}

A lot of kids with leg braces and crutches.  Hated the Salk vaccine, because it was a large needle (to a kid) injected vaccine. and as with most injections in the '50's, it hurt like hell.   Later on, Sabin came out with a stronger vaccine that was taken orally, usually on a sugar cube.  ""Sabin on Sunday"" was the program that was used.  You had to take three doses on different weeks (if I remember correctly)  Pictures do not do the disease justice.  A buddy in leg braces brings it home quite quickly.Dan Gardner writes the end of his book, *The Science of Fear*:

""In central Ontario, near where my parents live, there is a tiny cemetery filled with rusted ironwork and headstones heaved to odd angles by decades of winter frost and spring thaws. This was farm country once. Pioneers arrived at the end of the nineteenth century, cut the trees, pulled up the stumps, and discovered, after so much crushing labor, that their new fields amounted to little more than a thin layer of soil stretched across the bare granite of the Canadian Shield. Most farms lasted a generation or two before the fields were surrendered to the forests. Today, only the cemeteries remain.
 
 
The pioneers were not wealthy people, but they always bought the biggest headstones they could afford. They wanted something that declared who they were, something that would last. They knew how easily their own existence could end. Headstones had to endure. “Children of James and Janey Morden,” announces one obelisk in the cemetery. It’s almost six feet tall. The stone says the first to die was Charles W. Morden. He was four years and nine months old.
 
 
It was the winter of 1902. The little boy would have complained that he had a sore throat. He was tired and his forehead felt a little warm to his mother’s hand. A day or two passed and as Charles lay in bed he grew pale. His heart raced. His skin burned and he started to vomit. His throat swelled so that each breath was a struggle and his head was immobilized on the sweat-soaked pillow. His mother, Janey, would have known what was torturing her little boy, but with no treatment she likely wouldn’t have dared speak its name.
 
 
Then Charles’s little brother, Earl, started to cry. His throat was sore, he moaned. And he was so hot. Albert, the oldest of the boys, said he, too, was tired. And yes, his throat hurt.
 
 
Charles W. Morden died on Tuesday, January 14, 1902. His father would have had to wrap the little boy’s body in a blanket and carry him out through the deepening snow to the barn. The cold would seep into the corpse and freeze it solid until spring, when rising temperatures would thaw the ground and the father could dig his son’s grave.
 
 
The next day, both Earl and Albert died. Earl was two years and ten months old. Albert was six years and four months. Their father would have gotten out two more blankets, wrapped his sons, and taken them out to the barn to freeze.
 
 
Then the girls started to get sick. On January 18, 1902, the eldest died. Minnie Morden was ten years old. Her seven-year-old sister, Ellamanda, died the same day.
 
 
On Sunday, January 19, 1902, the fever took little Dorcas, barely eighteen months old. For the final time, James Morden bundled a child in a blanket, walked through the snow, and laid her down in the cold and dark of the barn, where she and her brothers and sisters would wait through the long winter to be buried.""

That was diphtheria. Nowadays, every child gets the DPT vaccine, so we don't have it anymore in the Western world.It's sad when people don't understand why vaccines are a good thing. All they see is that small portion that might be related to something awful, but they have never experienced having 5 children just so there is a solid chance one of them grows up.This is a huge part of the problem: people don't remember. Vaccines have been so successful at getting rid of these diseases that people have no memory of what things were like when they were still around. Very few of us have lost a child to measles or polio, or even know someone who has, or know someone that knows someone...

The diseases vaccines are preventing have been forgotten by the general population.I think at this point we can conclusively say that Reddit is anti-anti-vaccination.It's a lot of fun to circlejerk about this stuff, but the issue is that antivaxers literally have an answer for everything. They have graphs that show polio and smallpox were in decline before the vaccines, and therefore chalk it up to improved infrastructure. A lot of them don't even believe the vaccines work. 

You can pound them with study after study, and they'll come back with obscure studies that show vaccines aren't safe, then claim that the reason theirs didn't get enough attention was because no one will take antivax claims seriously enough to attempt to replicate the results. And they'll say the funding isn't there. And they'll say that Big Pharma is just trying to sell vaccines and using their power and influence to keep the science one-sided. 

The more moderate ones will say that sure, they may work, but the cost outweighs the benefit and their sister's kid became autistic three days after getting his MMR. 

This is the kind of thing we're up against. Logic and reason go out the window because the Momma Bear has come out in these people. Either their child or friend's child got autism or something else and they feel like they're to blame. But they can't handle that, so they need an outlet. Vaccines being given so close to the age of autism, they become the perfect scapegoat.""I don't need to vaccinate my children, science has wiped out measles and polio"".   Yes it did, effectively, by having generations of children VACCINATED.  And YOU'RE breaking that cycle.Hmmm...white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white...

This appears to be a racially-targeted biological weapon, possibly Africanized, like the bees.Oh yeah?! Well what about that ONE study done by that ""CREDIBLE"" doctor who definitely did ""NOT"" get his license revoked?

Edit: added "" "" because some asshats didn't pick up on my sarcasm.Jonas Salk was one smart ass motherfucker. Polio is a terrible thing. I recently invested in teeny tiny baby coffins.

Let's keep this going through 2015. I have a mortgage.My mom and my SO's aunt both had polio in the late 40s. My mom was pregnant and lost the baby.   They both recovered enough to use braces & crutches for the next 30 years.   Later they both developed Post-polio syndrome (resurgence of weakness & loss of control).  For my mom, it meant she had to use a wheelchair. For SO's aunt, it meant wheelchair and trouble breathing. My mom and my SO's aunt struggled with polio related health problems for the rest of their lives.  My mom died at age 60, SO's aunt at 62.  

From both seeing what polio does to a person, there was never a question for my SO & I that our son would get his polio and all the rest of his vaccinations.  Anti-vaxxers have no idea.  [deleted]I sure remember how nice polio was before the vaccine.https://imgur.com/GbpSYMA

Remember that smallpox was wiped out due to a global vaccination campaign.

My Mom and her sister grew up in rural Thailand.  I can still see the emotional scars when my Mom eventually told me why my Auntie walks funny, is unable to run, nor stand for extended periods of time.  She was struck by Polio before the vaccine became readily available.  I think back to that whenever I hear about anti-vaxers; I feel nothing but rage for their stupidity and ignorance. My grandfather lived a rough life because of polio and died a horrible death because of post-polio.

I have no problem with requiring parents to either do:**Vaccination or Sterilization**

It kills me when people say its for religious beliefs. As a christian if you read the old testament God gave them ways to stopping the plague and other diseases and ways to treat it. My family goes to church every week but you best believe my momma had me up in the doctors getting me every vaccine there was. Unless you have some crazy allergy to the vaccine you need to be getting it. As a future parent, I'm scared shitless about the amount of misinformation and FUD spreading going on.  I'm also scared that this is becoming a political topic.  This *is not* a political issue.  It's science.  Get your kids vaccinated you idiots.""At first glance, this image shocks and saddens from the enormity of the problem of sick children in need of iron lungs. On closer examination, it is clear that the equipment that usually accompanied people using iron lungs, such as tracheotomy tubes and pumps and tankside tables, is not present (compare the picture to photographs in the section on the iron lung). This scene was staged for a film. It is not historically accurate as a respirator ward, but is an example of an established photographic technique (famously used, for example, by WPA photographers in the 1930s) of directing the viewer’s response by creating a shot that would not naturally occur.""

http://amhistory.si.edu/polio/historicalphotos/Well at least they don't have autism! The anti-vaccine movement is one case where the internet sucks.

Why the same parents who wouldn't dream of driving down their own suburban block without their kids securely fastened in their car seats would refuse to vaccinate the same kids is just dumbfounding to me.""George Lucas didn't ruin my childhood, fucking polio did.""So sad. A room full of Iron Man rejects.An anti vaxer in California that knew one of the families that got measles at Disney purposely exposed her children to the virus and brought measles to a new county.

Well,  one time, on our way back through, a shovel was laid down in a very narrow hallway that was definitely not there before. We would have noticed it the first time; the hallway was narrow enough we had to step over it. On a different occasion, while we were on the ground floor, we heard a radio turn on somewhere above us (the ground floor's ceiling is a couple floors high, the room has all these ladders and metal walkways above).

One thing I heard from a friend of mine was that while living in Italy, she found out that Italians are very protective of all children, not just their own, and that it is a very safe place to raise children.  I would gather then, that this woman bringing her child to work with her is not uncommon or looked down upon.I had friends who brought their baby to Italy and couldn't believe the way people treated her. Like a princess. No matter where they went, their little one was welcomed like a long-lost relative. She said it was so different compared to how kids are thought of here in the US. I imagine from this picture that most people there DGAF that she brings the kid.If Italian legislators are anything like American ones, the little girl is just as mature and qualified as the rest of them to be voting for legislation, so why not?In the last picture she got three votes. That's like cheating.Ha look at her raising her hand to vote with mom. Hate on people bringing their kids to work all you want, those pics are adorable.I'm sure if the kid was a problem then they would have kindly asked her to not bring her daughter to work.

I didn't do it because I wanted to, but because I had no other choice. So as long as my children don't disrupt, we all win. This idea that children cannot/will not behave when they are required to is BS. I was routinely complimented on their excellent manners and ability to keep themselves quietly busy. For most kids, this can be taught and they will so. I'm sure there are exceptions, but I've done it and seen it done by many women.

This actually makes me sad... 

EDIT: OP is a bundle of sticks. It was a tree... When I was 12, I got stuck in the Small World ride at Disneyland for over an hour. The song kept playing over and over and the puppets were still going while we were all stuck in the boat. It was the worst. Finally after about 45 minutes, they turned the music off, but that left the puppets creepily mechanically dancing, their permanent smiles plastered on their faces.I work with an adult with special needs and took him to Disneyland a couple years ago.

My grandparents lived in vidor for many years. And every time I'd pass that sign as a kid, it would really freakin scare me. That sign has been there for 20 yearsThat makes me so sad. Her father really loves her Best Ive got in my town is a sign saying ""our neighbor kills pets keep an eye on him""I have lived in Vidor for 48 years. I raised my children in Vidor at some of the best public schools around. The comments that some of the people have made is really sad. It's obvious you have never been to Vidor. You would be welcome anytime of the day or night no matter what your ethnicity is. The sign has aged and been refreshed several times over the years. Used to drive by it every day. I lived in Vidor 20 years ago and that place was fucked up. It was corrupt sunset town run by the KKK. I was a biker jacket wearing, long haired teenaged boy and my first day there I got a beer bottle broken over my head walking down the road. I lived there for 6 months and stayed inside the whole time. It doesn't surprise me at all that a murder cover up would go down over there.The people in Vidor, Texas are all screwed up. Vidor and Orange Texas, back in the fifties, were big supporters of the KKK. Things happened down there that I don't want to mention.The parents' anguish is unimaginable. As years go by and no one else is charged with this murder, it makes the Dad's theory all the more plausible. I wonder why this was never investigated. Is there some kind of national group that might be able to help? Something like John Walsh's ""Most Wanted,"" but dealing in cold case investigation?

So, so sad. :(I can't imagine having a child who was murdered, and it was never solved. 

If this is the worst the father does, so be it. I would of been in jail for murder myself already.Why doesn't he just go brutally murder him?

That's what I'd do.Ooh been waiting a long time for my Vidor joke my dad always used to tell me... 

Why is Vidor known for inventing toothpaste?

Because if it was invented anywhere else, it would be called teethpaste!Steve Page will have to bribe the Vidor P.D. again and all of us.

In grade 10 my highschool was offering a trip to Paris; I worked my ass off at my part time job and my mom helped me make the small difference to pay for the trip. And I went. First day we went up the tower, it was nearing sunset and there was a warm gentle wind. I was at a loss for words with the view, and for one of the only times in my life I really felt like I could do or be anything. I really love that city.

Edit: Thanks for the gold. That was unexpected and very sweet of you.My mother is French/Swiss and when I was about 8 or 10 years old I went with her to visit family.

I was dragged around all the museums and places a 8-10 yr old kid couldn't fully appreciate at that age.

The one thing I was looking forward to was seeing the view from the top of the Eiffel Tower.

We finally got to the tower and to my disappointment my mother did not want to pay the fee to take the elevator up.

I offered to use the stairs. Nope. Not happening. I was crushed.

Still hold a tiny grudge to this day about it and it is still on my bucket list of things I want to do.

Great picture that really shows how much of an amazing view I would have seen.

**Update:** Wow I never expected so much of a response. I still love my Mom. :) I still have plenty of memories of that trip. I got mugged by a little girl for my used metro passes and saw the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. From that height you should be able to synchronize and perform a leap of faith on a haystack below.Can you see any of those no-go zones in this pic?I was in Paris during the World Cup in 98. Didn't go for the World Cup, that's just how it worked out. Of course we go to the Eiffel Tower and it was completely packed. We cram ourselves into the elevator and ride up to the top observation deck place. I was looking at the plaque things(New York is X miles that way!) and I heard a curious sound behind me. 

They were back on these, I'm guessing, service stairs. A woman sitting on the stairs, a man sitting in front of her. Now the room is packed, but they don't care. He's vigorously fingering her and she's got a hand over her mouth. 'Fingering' might not be a strong enough word, he might have been Handing her. Maybe 20 seconds and they're done. They kiss and walk around a corner.

I think about them sometimes still. Someone remembers them fingering on top of the Eiffel Tower and they'll never know.[deleted]People were complaining of overprocessing, but I can't find an unprocessed version of this image. Looking around on reddit I found a similar images.

It kind of looks like the Millennium falcon.Many people (myself included) think the actual best view in Paris is from the top of the Montparnasse tower (Tour Montparnasse).  It's the only skyscraper in the city limits.  The view is thought to be the best because it's the only view of the city from which you can't see the Montparnasse Tower.Those HDR clouds thoLa defense is always a very interesting part of the city to me. It is a huge cluster of very modern buildings in the middle of a bunch of very old, traditional architecture.haussmannizationThat's so cool.Clicked on this and though 'Wait, Paris... where's the Eiffel Tower?' I should really read things all the way through.
Lovely picture, either way.Beautiful looking cityParis is the most beautiful city I have ever seen. Before I went I was told by many people that Parisians were not very friendly people. I found the opposite to be true. A cafe waiter and another patron (from Paris) almost got into a fist fight over the best way to get to Versailles. I can't wait to go back. Thanks for bringing back some memories.I always thought the view of the Eiffel Tower was better than the view from the Eiffel Tower, but this picture is fantastic.Reminded me of this video http://youtu.be/QwNc0SFIp-o
Great photo, btw.I find it amazing how such an iconic structure has such prevalence for its appearance, and yet, the beautiful view (FROM the structure) does not seem to be known or popular, at all.
Man, this is a pretty picture.What awful HDR. People take it way too far way too often.France being the only foreign country I've visited thus far it holds a distinction in my memory; this view in particular. To quote one of the people we stayed with; ""If you have a car in Paris, it's going to get dented and urinated on."" Go to Paris for landmarks; go to rural France for amazing and hospitable people that will give fat American kids peppermint schnapps. (Old sentiment; recent events notwithstanding. Vive Paris.)
After quite a day of walking across what I estimate to be half the city, admittedly breathtaking in more ways than one, we reached the base of the tower. Every movie and show showing a smarmy romance scene at the top leads you to believe an elevator goes all the way up. This was not the case. At a fraction of the way up, my little piggy legs were telling my brain that the view was quite fine from halfway. 
At this point my father had gotten a tuna sandwich from a convenient outlet at this level. I looked over at him between heaving breaths. 
Don't remember the exact words, and I've never even been a fan of tuna, but at that moment it was salvation between divine French bread. He began ascending the steps, which I reluctantly followed.

tldr: As a fat fuck 13 year old I literally chased a sandwich to the top of the Eiffel tower.

Here's a YouTube video of its scream http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=77_oa_Cyw3g

Fun fact it's scream is actually commonly used in western movies for roadkill and almost any bird that flies by.Former Falconer here. 

With out being able to see the tail it's hard to tell, but I'd venture a guess based on pics that it's a Passage bird, meaning less than a year old. Based on the scale from the second pic, this is definitely a female. 

If you can find a way to get a glance at the tail, you can confirm if it's a passage bird as the tail feathers will NOT have their trademark brick red color yet. Those only come in after their first molt. Prior to that the tail feathers are brown with white bars much like the rest of the plumage. 

Only 1 in 5 red tails will survive their first year in the wild. Life's not easy when you're catching fast, smart prey with your feet. At least she's up high where she can get a vantage, so many baby birds sit low on fences thinking it's easier. The smart ones learn that altitude = advantage and those are the ones that will survive to receive their brick red tail. And he's very disappointed by your work.

How do people make a living there?They must get sand in EVERYTHINGFor those interested in Huacachina...here is information about issues with water levels from peruthisweek.com.  When I was there in 2012, friends told me that unauthorized/illegal wells have been drilled causing issues with water levels, and the sand boarding/dune buggies are having a damaging impact on the lagoon.

If you go out there, I do recommend stopping in at the Museo Regional de Ica.  I went there on a weekday with my ex-boyfriend's Mom (my ex and I had a bitter breakup, but his family adores me...and I still adore them and keep in touch.).  I forget how much the admission fee was...but his Mom and I were the only two people in the museum at that time.  

Part of me was amazed by the poor security (compared to what we have in first world nations), that the majority of the items weren't preserved, and that the artifacts weren't in a temperature/humidity controlled environment.  I was fascinated by the artifacts, representations of Pre-Inca/Inca culture, pottery, weavings, mummies, especially the explanation/representation of mummies who had brain surgery performed on them (when they were living).  While there are summaries of items in English, t is definitely worth paying for a guide to explain things to you in in further depth.

The banks of the Huacachina lagoon have been progressively and dangerously covered in a fine and hot layer of desert sand. This has generated a worrying decrease in the water level and in the beautiful green color of both the water and the vegetation around it. 


According to conservationist Félix Quinteros Ferreyra, the drastic reduction in water levels, which yesterday caused the lagoon to shrink to just 1.5 meters of depth and recede to 8 meters from the edge of the bank, is threatening to dry up the lagoon altogether and make one of Ica’s principal tourist attractions all but disappear.


“The indifference and lack of planning on the part of the municipal authority [who is responsible for the protection, conservation and care of the lagoon] to create a permanent project to naturally refill the lagoon is putting the body of water in serious risk,” Quinteros said. 


Both the exploitation of the aquifer and the drilling of wells over the last 25 years have made it so that the lagoon is no longer able to refill naturally and, as has happened with other similar bodies of water, it is on a course to dry up permanently.


“The maintainance of the water level in the lagoon has been contingent on the decisions of the Municipal Potable Water Company of Ica (Empica), which has suspended the service of pumping water every time that the municipal authority has failed to pay,” Quinteros said.


It is now necessary to reactivate the Rincón Grande project, which was designed to help naturally refill the lagoon with a natural spring located behind one of the dunes of Huacachina, Quinteros added.


The plan was originally developed in 1997 when the lagoon was faced with a similar – though not as serious – threat, according to Quinteros. 


The project allowed the lagoon to not only regain much of the natural and medicinal qualities of its water, but also to refill the lagoon to about 2 meters, which then covered its banks. 


The ex-president of tourist services for the Francisco Massa commune said that the lack of municipal authority in the area has allowed up to 56 dune buggies to have a damaging environmental impact on the lagoon and its beaches and to fill the area with excess amounts of sand and cause serious noise pollution.

I miss Rochester. Rochester does tend to look that way a lot of the timeITT: An inexplicable amount of people who have lived in Rochester, NY.It's Always Cloudy in RochesterRochester = Winterfell

Source: Lived there for 20 yearsThats a great place to take that picture. Then turn around and drink beers instead.Good old Rochester.Brand it as ""little Niagra"", throw up a honeymooners hotel, and you can turn that place around. I was born and raised in Rochester. In 1975, this was the only city with sponsors willing to accept refugees from Southeast Asia. If my parents waited one more year, I would've been born in France. We grew up two blocks from the Genesee Brewery, but two blocks from Ave D and Conkey Ave (the Fatal Crescent).

A lot of has changed over the past few years. My father never moved from our original street. He's got a good paying job as a tool and dye maker, but likes paying low property taxes. According to a recent statistic, area code 14605 has a median income just shy of ~$10,000.

My dad used to tell me stories about when he came here. He purchased the house from an old German couple. Like many whites who grew up in the center of the city, they moved outward to the suburbs. White flight. Still Rochester wasn't so bad. My uncle used to work for an airplane plant for $25/hr in the 1980s. I never bothered to ask what the company name was, but it has since relocated. 

The downfall of Rochester was the accumulation of many things. Sure we can blame Kodak for not properly investing in its own invention of digital photography, but digital photography would have downsized Kodak's labor force dramatically. It was so large that a dramatic change in the labor force would effectively kill the livelihood of many Rochesterians. Maybe the only way for Kodak to lay off their workers was if they were forced to externally. 

Still Downtown Rochester wasn't so bad. Midtown Mall generated a lot of commerce. However, the city decided it was a good idea to save money on their budget by switching from public yellow school buses to public transportation. Children entering early middle and high school were forced to take the public transportation that everyone else took to get to school. 

The only students who were required to take buses were kids attending the city schools. Rochester is zoned very peculiarly and there are other factors like official addresses of the child and that child's actual addresses since people in the city tend to have large families. We have many high schools all across Rochester so if you lived on another side of town and you went to East High School, you had to take two buses: one from the school and another one to transfer. This was normal for most kids including me. Regardless, everyone pretty much would have to get off at the main terminal to transfer buses. Well guess where the main terminal was? Downtown Rochester. 

What happens when you place a majority of socio-economically deprived high schoolers who tend to be black, hispanic or a minority in a major shopping district? Loitering, crime, and fighting.

Rochester is still a some-what large city with regional differences within the 490. As with every city, there are rivalries associated with residence. West Side is harder than East Side. Empire Boulevard which lined Webster still had a good portion of residences who should be in Webster, but technically live in the city. Groups from different parts of Rochester who never really interacted before were now placed together in one spot. I know dozens of people who've never been more than a 3 mile radius from their home.

Crime went rampant in downtown Rochester. Consumers who tended to be middle or working class didn't feel safe shopping at Midtown. Fights, vandalism, and theft exploded as you pushed thousands of delinquents into one area between the hours of 3-5pm. Although it's nothing like Compton, there are still small persistent gangs in Rochester. You get the point. Wegmans pulled out and so did many other businesses. Midtown collapsed and many businesses sprawled outward to the growing suburbs. What ended up saving the city millions of dollars cost them millions more plus the immeasurable image and social costs. 

Then you have 490. 490 is like a physical barrier between urban and suburban. Everything in 490 is considered ""ghetto"" while outside is suburb (EDIT: I call it just 490, but it's 590, 390, and 490 altogether, but that is not the point the point is there is a highway that circles the city). There is a bridge that links Winton Road from the city to Brighton. That area can be referred to as East Ave. Now East Ave is definitely not a terrible place and is actually awesome, but you can see definitely see the difference in housing. 104 in the North is actually a better indicator since the contrast is more apparent. 104 is just another divider of class seen in the city although that is being blurred.

On top of that, much of the wealth expanded outward into the suburbs. There are little major businesses in the city itself. Most of the businesses come from small business owners running family restaurants, barber shops, corner stores and auto-shops. Irondequoit Mall (now Medley Center) used to be an awesome suburban mall, but it has declined since. I think the only store in that mall is Macy's. But because of it's location, it was the prime destination for people in the city. Greece Mall is now the new Irondequoit Mall. They beefed up security and now you are only allowed to shop in the mall if you are over 18 or have adult supervision. 

Many school districts who used to employ something called Urban Suburban where they took exceptional students from the inner-city and placed them into wealthier school districts are removing this. This was awesome since it gave some kids a chance to get a 'quality' education. Theresa used to be the head (I think still is), but she was an absolute saint. She worked her ass off to get a lot of deserving students into the better school districts. It blew up and became more difficult to manage properly. Inner-city families became more desperate. A program that could freely select students they saw fit became more of a political battleground for families desperately trying to get their child into a suburban school. The meetings they held for discussion and selection got bigger and nastier. I haven't spoken to her since, but I could imagine what a headache the program had become. It became more of a burden not only on the parent side, but suburban side with trying increasing student quotas. I was lucky enough to go to a suburban school and go to college while Urban Suburban was still intact.


The crime city and social interaction in the city is peculiar. The problems with Rochester are just as socio-economic as it is racial. There is a shit ton of white resentment among kids and people here. The older generation of blacks and hispanics are more accustomed to the despair and act as a more stagnate class. Either working pay check to pay check with little progress or not working at all. Seriously, it's like living in toxic bubble. Theres always drug trafficking that gets the eye of RPD, but most disturbance calls are domestic. RPD rides 2 squad cars deep everywhere they go. My best friend is looking to become a cop and during a ride along his officer stopped a fairly nice looking silver sedan from leaving the city suspecting they were some suburban kids buying drugs from the city. No one in the city buys silver sedans. People are nice though. Seriously, one of my childhood friends pushes and he's the nicest drug dealer around. The guys who post on the Valerio on Clinton in Upper Falls are the nicest drug dealers a stranger would meet. 

It's sad to see Rochester become how it is today and I'm trying to look for hope for the people I grew up with, but it's difficult. I want to go back and help, but there are so many fucking problems. 

**TL;DR** Rochester did a lot of shit to itself to fuck itself up over the past three decades. 

EDIT: Many many mistakes. 

EDIT 2: My mother worked at Hickey Freeman. Another prestigious Rochester firm. Work for them has slowed tremendously. I know a bunch of old ladies who still work there and they only work if they get called in which is sad. Some are lucky if they get 20 hour work weeks. Their main factory is dead center in the heart of the city located right at the corner of Clinton and Avenue D.

EDIT 3: 490/390. I just simply refer to is as 490. There is 390, 590, and 490 that enclose the city of Rochester.Did you put a 'depressing' filter on this? Damn..This time of year, in Rochester... only garbage plates and the anticipation of abbotts will save youHonestly, this time of year does not flatter any city. Rochester is a beautiful place come spring time. Only a few more weeks and hopefully we'll be out of this shitty winter.Yeah! Took [this](http://imgur.com/ntvHtrK) almost exactly a year ago visiting from the UK. Not really sure why I went to Rochester but there's some cool stuff going on amongst the rest of it.

The whale, sensing she was in trouble, gently grabbed her by the leg and pushed her to the surface. 

The whale was credited with saving her life.

Such incredible animals, and so undeserving of the way we've treated them.

?Never heard of a cramp that disables the entire body.I don't see the need for disbelief about this story: surely a Beluga is acutely aware and capable of getting a calf to the surface were it suffocating; I imagine the same instinct kicked-in regarding the human mammal. As for the set-up, the chinese have far less OSHA type regulations; hosting an apnea competition in a marine tank would be nearly taboo in the u.s.a, while in China it's simply a cool idea and a great real-world simulation. I'm sure the photographer is dry, behind glass. Regards to the apparent lack of human rescuers is a good question...I think basic lack of oversight as they're typically more concerned with shallow water blackout. That, and the instinctual/auditory Beluga response is way faster than a human visually recognizing the condition and diving down. The diver was in total doom with a photographer with oxygen 10 ft away.""Whale kills free diver, pulling her to the bottom of the Ocean""...while the photographer...?""Vicious whale tries to devour helpless diver. Cameraman just watches.""The cameraman just watched though.Mrs. Diver didn't ask to be saved. Mrs. Diver didn't want to be saved. And the injuries received from Mr.Whale's so-called ""actions"" cause her daily pain.

This sensor is part of the SRS sensor, as well as a identical one on the passenger side of the radiator supports.

Yep, and that's a good thing too. Otherwise OP is probably in 10 different pieces right now. What did you hit?I thanked Jeep for being on the [other end of a car doing 65 into the back of mine](http://i.imgur.com/sGfyAxJ.jpg).  Fractured my ankle during the impact but I was able to open my door and limp away.

Edit: I'd like to add the asshats from Defalcos Towing in NJ stole two toolboxes, my jacket and ruffled through my backpack before I got the car back.  Apparently in NJ it's a known/acceptable behavior to do this.  Glad to see OP got those golf clubs back, in NJ they would've been stolen too.What kind of car is...er, was that?> ...one bruise on my body.

I represent a firm that would like to help find compensation for the egregious bodily harm you've incurred by the inaction of whomever to protect you from that fence. Okay well here is the backstory to this since some people are asking!

I was driving home one night after going grocery shopping. This happened about 3 weeks ago. I was in the process of moving houses hence the boxes and golf clubs. I was just driving along and yes, I was speeding a tad but still driving safely. Next thing I know I saw a deer right in front of me. Honestly I had no time to think and my reaction was to swerve. So I did! I (thankfully, and un- thankfully) missed the deer, but swerved a little too much and my back tires hit some grass. I fish-tailed for about 50 feet or so before I lost full control of the car. I went through a wood fence, down a ditch and into about 7 trees, snapping 4 of them. I had a friend in the car with me and he was perfectly okay along with myself. We opened our eyes and all I really remember was freaking out about the airbags and telling my friend we need to get out of the car. We both were very shaken up but no injuries at all. I'm very and sincerely thankful for every tiny thought that has gone through these engineers heads that have made the safety of cars incredible. It blows my mind and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it.

TL;DR I survived a crazy accident. Safety saved my ass.
Girl rear-ended my 92 Prelude doing 70 while I was fully stopped. Got a lot more beat up than OP, but I'm still here. My brain is a little more pudding, though.

http://imgur.com/a/ZWRrqBack in the mid 90's I hit a cement wall at 80 mph at a glancing blow in a 1987 Toyota Camry equipped with air bags and crush zones.  Someone side-swiped me and pushed me in to the wall.  The car spun around 5-6 times before coming to halt and then was hit by passing vehicles twice.

Paramedics who arrived on the scene thought the driver, me, was dead in the car, considering how banged up it was.  I was outside to greet them and they didn't believe that I was the driver.    

Since then, we've bought Toyota as a family.As someone who designs/builds/tests airbags (not for takata), I'm glad to have helped :)http://i.imgur.com/3iMSq3f.jpgYou actually want to thank the men and women  of the  US Congress who crafted legislation compelling automobile manufacturers to adopt the safety features which saved your life. Thousands of us would not be here today were it not for the tireless efforts of the NHTSA and other federal oversight entities created by the Highway Safety Act of 1970.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_AdministrationThat looks like a car with a 5 star safety rating. Once.. as a young man hitch hiking through texas...some guy picked me up and asked me to drive his pickup truck.. towing a trailer full of racing dogs...
  
Sooo I am from the big city and didn't even have a license but I was like sure. So he got a sixpack and started drinking a few as I drove down the two lane highway at night...he had already driven like ten hours or something so he is napping and we are in the middle of nowhere..
  
I see eyes .. deer eyes in front of me..  I saw them early enough and swerved a bit left to miss one and then swerved back to the right to miss another..he got jolted and said ""whaaa?"" and I said ""deer"" and he grunted and went back to sleep.
  
I was a cocky kid but years later I realized how close I came.to death..> I just want to take a moment to thank the men and women who design the safety features for cars.

This is what's left of my wife's corolla, after coming off the highway around 55mph and glancing off one of the large light poles out there. A couple feet difference would've put the pole right into her door. Suffice to say, she's only got some bruises and stiff parts, as opposed to far worse.

>Medal of Honor Official Citation reads:

>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an Automatic Rifleman with Company F, 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, Regimental Combat Team 1, 1st Marine Division (Forward), I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom on 21 November 2010. Lance Corporal Carpenter was a member of a platoon-sized coalition force, comprised of two reinforced Marine rifle squads partnered with an Afghan National Army squad. The platoon had established Patrol Base Dakota two days earlier in a small village in the Marjah District in order to disrupt enemy activity and provide security for the local Afghan population. Lance Corporal Carpenter and a fellow Marine were manning a rooftop security position on the perimeter of Patrol Base Dakota when the enemy initiated a daylight attack with hand grenades, one of which landed inside their sandbagged position. Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Carpenter moved toward the grenade in an attempt to shield his fellow Marine from the deadly blast. When the grenade detonated, his body absorbed the brunt of the blast, severely wounding him, but saving the life of his fellow Marine. By his undaunted courage, bold fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of almost certain death, Lance Corporal Carpenter reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.This guy jumped on a grenade to save his friend. I don't think anyone can doubt that he is a hero. He looks so genuinely happy after his surgery (which he should,  he looks great! )!Can someone fill me in on what's happening with his eye in the first photo? Obviously he lost that eye. What's that there in it's place?Dr. Chakwas does some great work.I see a lot of people interested in the miracles of reconstructive surgery, so I thought people might be interested in [the guinea pig club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_Pig_Club). It was a group following WWII of vets who created a support group and voluntarily underwent experimental reconstructive surgery. It was practically the birth of modern reconstructive surgery, because never before had their been so many horrible burn victims at such a ripe time of medical technology. Out of this group come a lot of the innovations used today.

So [this is kind of hard to look at](http://31.media.tumblr.com/9e23a54f166ae08bfd7d2b8fe78664f7/tumblr_mqx2rhJxx21qc0pn9o1_1280.jpg). But this was [one of the earliest procedures to perform a skin graft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking-stalk_skin_flap). (keep in mind, they didn't stay long and pointy like [this](http://media.tumblr.com/c463795b1a9ece62b93c2a7993d28d6e/tumblr_inline_n3rqdmRgm21sohk3w.gif)). It was invented by [Harold Gillies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Gillies) (a Kiwi!) as part of the post-war bloom in reconstructive surgery brought about by the horrible injuries especially to RAF pilots in the UK. Note that this procedure is still performed sometimes, though it is largely being phased out.

Britain joined the air game later than many of its contemporaries, so when it came down to it, they needed something that could be manufactured quickly. [The earliest planes they had manufactured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane_variants#Hurricane_Mk_I) were wood and stretched canvas, and filled with munitions and fuel. Being shot down was a certain way to be burned horribly. And then, especially in the battle of Britain, this meant that they were going down in their own country.

And so governments had this question of what to do with these horribly maimed morale-killers walking around in the general population with these terribly maimed bodies, and so part of this push for the government footing the bill for all these experimental techniques was in part a strategic one. Because, to cover up their wounds was also a way to ease the population's mind about the war, in a way. ""If you are hurt defending your country, you will receive help, regardless the cost."" Kyle Carpenter's reconstructive surgery is a continuation of that legacy.
Damn reconstructive surgery has come a long way. That said, he looked like kind of a badass before hand.He should have kept the Terminator eye. [The Guy is a fucking beast!](http://i.imgur.com/PUjAj3P.jpg)

And some one a whole hell of a lot of Marines look up to, I have the absolute utmost for this Marine. My fiancée was asked out by Kyle Carpenter, she is part of the media team for the Marine Corps and was doing a huge story on him during his time under the spotlight and she wanted to see what he was like behind all the lights and cameras so she went out with a few coworkers with him and his friends and by the end of the night they were just sitting in a booth at a Dave and Busters just talking. She had told me how down to earth he was and just a nice person, being a Marine myself I had even more respect for him because sometimes Marines are known to be a little cocky. Later the next day she had told me he had been texted her asking to go out sometime, I didn't know what to say. I mean if there was a man who I knew would honor and respect my fiancée and was just a great man its a medal of honor recipient so I didn't know how to react. Usually when a guy hits on your SO you stand up and do what needs to be done but I actually had respect for this man so I was speechless. She respectfully declined and said she was engaged but I feel like I was doing my country a disservice by not letting Kyle Carpenter take my fiancée out.those dimples.Does it make me a bad person that I immediately think he kinda looks like Shepard from Mass Effect without the fixed Lazarus upgrades?Let's be honest..... he's a cutie!!!Dude looks like a total stud.

Semper Fi""For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an Automatic Rifleman with Company F, 2d Battalion, 9th Marines, Regimental Combat Team 1, 1st Marine Division (Forward), I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward), in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom on 21 November 2010. Lance Corporal Carpenter was a member of a platoon-sized coalition force, comprised of two reinforced Marine rifle squads partnered with an Afghan National Army squad. The platoon had established Patrol Base Dakota two days earlier in a small village in the Marjah District in order to disrupt enemy activity and provide security for the local Afghan population. Lance Corporal Carpenter and a fellow Marine were manning a rooftop security position on the perimeter of Patrol Base Dakota when the enemy initiated a daylight attack with hand grenades, one of which landed inside their sandbagged position. Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Carpenter moved toward the grenade in an attempt to shield his fellow Marine from the deadly blast. When the grenade detonated, his body absorbed the brunt of the blast, severely wounding him, but saving the life of his fellow Marine. By his undaunted courage, bold fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of almost certain death, Lance Corporal Carpenter reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.""

It's difficult to determine the correct response to an attack like this.  Living lives in fear means the terrorists win.  Military response and attack against the organization means new recruits join and the terrorists win.Aux armes citoyens! Formez vos bataillons! Marchons, Marchons!

Nice try, OP.  The police have been alerted.When I was a kid, I went over to a friend's house to see if he could come out and play. As I'm walking up to the house, I see something really similar to this on the driveway. I thought it was a smoothie or something similar that had been spilled, but I knocked on the door and no one was home.

Found out the following day that my friend's little brother had been shooting hoops outside and went for a dunk. He lost his grip on the hoop and smashed his face right on the concrete. I can't remember how many stitches he needed but he ended up being fine after a really long recovery. But that mess on the driveway was stained there for quite a long time.Dexters first class.

I would love to read a comic with this style remaking the star wars.remake the star wars movies in fuedal japan? id watch them allHere's his workflow. https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lord-vader-and-this-troops[Reminds](http://cgfelker.deviantart.com/art/Samurai-Vader-345286883) me of [Clinton Felker](http://cgfelker.deviantart.com/art/Samurai-Storm-Trooper-Archer-345285982)'s [work](http://cgfelker.deviantart.com/art/Samurai-Boba-Fett-Profile-art-for-fabrication-345286502).Kurosawa did it first. It's called Hidden Fortress.Actually, it's interesting that folks are excited by the idea of a feudal Japan Star Wars because Lucas based a lot of his script on Japanese films, particularly the films of Kurosawa. Check out ""The Hidden Fortress"" it's essentially the story of Star Wars with the inspiration for R2-D2 and 3CPO in two of the central characters. There's many examples of inspiration and story/character parallels to be found in the Kurosawa films of this era. I don't bring it up to dump on Lucus, just an interesting tidbit. Every artwork inspires a new artist I suppose. Would anyone mind making this 1920x1080?I love the idea of this. Holy shit, it really is weird seeing a guy you know end up on the first page of Reddit. Browsed the first page and did a double take when I saw his name.

The idea was to print out five photos of our single friend and go to a bar to find some cute guys. Then, we'd show them the photos of our friend. If they were interested, we'd take photos of them and get their number and she could choose from our pile of dudes. For some reason this sounded really really fun after a night of drinking.

The person looks crooked.Is it just me or does the right leg look photoshopped?
cool but I don't imagine it being super robust. I suppose it looks cool, but isn't one of the perks of modern prosthetics that that it is designed to mimic the leg's functionality both in cushioning and the force generated by the Achilles tendon?  I mean I often see them with piston-like inner structures and stuff.

Wouldn't it be better to have something like that and then 3D print an outer covering that would mimic the shape and size of that individual's remaining leg?Rendering...

Edit: As in his leg is rendering because you can see the wire frame.  Its a fucking joke about glitches in games.  Why did you think I meant that this was fake?  You guys are both dumb. Can someone please help? I can only view this picture in wireframe, won't let me see the textures.Nice, we have the same shoes. Should have 3D printed some new shoes too.

http://instagram.com/p/rJPVhlGdVW/?modal=truei was thinking of a sarcastic comment.. but naaah... its so beautiful That's so awesome.  I invent new paints for a living and have made a few aerosols before.  I think art like this needs to be supported more and people need to distinguish between this and someone putting up their dumb tag.  One of the problems is that the 2 largest aerosol manufacturers don't make an effort to support true artists that use their products and lump everyone into that same ""vandal"" category.

p.s.  Don't buy that idea paint dry erase fake advertising post on the front page.  They are all hype and sell their product at a ridiculous price.

Views were great, everywhere we stayed was awesome, Boulder is fucking sick, and [this was badass](http://i.imgur.com/5V3aWJJ.jpg)Living in Colorado Springs means you can view wildlife in your front yard, then drive ten minutes to Costco.

Stay out of Colorado.[Couldn't get this image out of my head](http://i.imgur.com/004KJh5.jpg)That is one funny looking dog.I have an obsession with Colorado and it won't be filled until I live there. My whole life growing up in the Midwest by dad would always say 'west is best'. And I never asked why I would just hear him say it. Then in 2002 we went on a family trip that I was more excited for than our previous one to Disney World, and that trip was to Yellowstone! We have this huge picture in my living room (still there now) of Old Faithful in all her.....which was amazing but didn't serve justice to what I expected from the photo, possibly my first ever disappointed memory. But to get there we took I-70 all the way from STL to Limon, Colorado. And I still to this day can't explain the huge smile on my dads face and his overall joy that filled the car when he finally saw the CO state sign. That moment is what makes me know my dads love for the state. Colorado was awesome. We kind of made a vague square around the state. I remember going to Colorado Springs, Gunnison, Pikes Peak, Ouray, and the best of all The Million Dollar Highway. We looped back north along the western state border I believe. Then hit the continental divide at some point....didn't stop for Denver. Blah blah. But my when I got older my Dad started talking about how he wanted to move to Colorado when he retired. He had taken a couple of motorcycle trips out there and visited more and more each time. And we even took a bike trip out there the summer I graduated High School. Which we even took the same path that we did the last time I had been out there and rode 792 miles in one day to get to Limon! We were sore but as we were riding on the interstate pulling up to the state sign my Dad pointed to the sign then thrusted both arms in the air several times in joy. My best memories with my Dad are in and talking about Colorado. Unfortunately, legalization has scared him off a little. Plus he is very doubtful he could afford it now. My dad is my everything and I could never repay him for what he is done for me. And this is the only reason I'm motivated to go to school and hopefully find a great job so I can one day afford to have my dad live in Colorado. He has loved the state for decades and only recent financial hardships have changed his mind to move. It is my personal mission to see that man in a log cabin with a view in Colorado. My grandparents lived in Colorado Springs and it was amazing. They had a beautiful view of the Rockies out their window (you could even see NORAD from their house...at least the antennae). Unfortunately, I didn't realize the beauty out there until way to late. Now my grandparents are gone and I have nothing ""making"" me go out there anymore. Just yesterday, I was thinking to myself why would anyone want to ever live any other place than Denver. I lived in Hong Kong, I spent time in London, I love Denver to bits.

One World Trade Center or ""Freedom Tower"" is the Tallest tower in the United States and the Western Hemisphere. Fourth Tallest in the world. 

The tower stands 1,776ft tall, which also happens to be the year the United States declared it's independence from the British.

I could have sworn that was a pyramid. its a really cool architectural design that lends it this effect, that makes it seem endless.Imagine, falling. Falling up. The ground and security you knew is flying away from you. Your feet swing up in front of you and Earth flips upside-down - as it all rushes away from you, you can see the tremendous spire of this building looming closer. Growing wider. You know once you go past that point you will be gone, lost. You flail for anything to catch you, anything to grab hold of before you wheel off into space, Gravity having denied you. But the building, it is not made to catch you. It reaches up, pointing its solid, single finger out, castigating you from all sense. No goodbyes. Only a ""Get Out.""This is awesome bro/sis

Wait, even better, we should start a line of bottled water that has like a single.oyster sitting in the bottom of the bottle. We can call it... H2Oyster**Window washers hate this secret!**Ocean acidification is threatening oysters.  Larval oysters are having a harder time forming their shell. This is a good way of showing why this matters. The conclusion I draw from this is that I should never eat oysters again.Unfortunately, you'll not see the water quality benefits of oyster reintroductions. Attempts at creating safe populations, where they can breed and increase their numbers fails as oyster fishermen poach every bed they find. 

Sources: I attended the Marine Estaurine Environmental Sciences program at Univ Maryland at the Chesapeake Bay.So I should put oysters in the bottom of my bong?THANK YOU.
Now the other fucking post i was reading with the 2 army tanks makes a HELL of a lot more sense now.
I've been thinking about it for the past 20 minutes and couldn't understand why i was so fucking confused =sIf the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay was what it historically was, it would filter the entire bay's volume of water in 3 days. The oyster population is so low now that it takes over a year. Can the oysters also predict the World Series winner?Oysters are great. I organize an effort in my town to create oyster mats. These mats are chained together in specific areas of the river and foster new oyster beds by giving the larvae a place to attach to. If we get enough growth, it may have a positive effect on our river's water quality. Each oyster can filter 50 gallons a day of water and they are a keystone species of many ecosystems.This isn't as clear-cut of a comparison as the image wants you to believe. The water being clear isn't an indication of ecological health any more than being murky is. Murky could be pollutants, but it could also be algae. Algae are necessary to the ecosystem. The water on the right appears stripped of algae because the oysters eat it. That's good up to a point, and then it starts being a problem.

If I showed you this exact same image using lake water and zebar mussels, it would be a demonstration of the ecological damage done by invasive zebra mussels.That's where the flavour comes from.Question: Can I get oysters and put them in a fish tank with my fish and never have to clean the water again? Or at least not clean it so often?I can't look at this without being horribly reminded about getting norovirus from oysters a couple of years ago, and this pic kinda makes it a bit clearer just how easy it is for them to pick up bacteria from the water. I've never been so ill in my adult life and haven't been able to eat oysters since! From my intense studying and observations, the water with the oysters seems to be cleaner.

It's been in ruins for a thousand years and not like they had pictures to go offA little more info on the display:

This display at Carnuntum is the only one of its kind on this site. It is even meant as a temporary display since sooner or later the Heidentor (heathen's gate) is supposed to be rebuilt following original Roman building style.

They have a very nice museum at the excavation site nearby where they already have a few fully functional Roman buildings that were rebuilt in the original style and with original materials.

Carnuntum is a fascinating excavation site with a very cleverly built museum which constantly improves.

During summer they have some festivities there and at their sister site ""Bad Deutsch Altenburg"". They show Gladiator fights, Roman army training, Roman lifestyle in general.

The site is about half an hour drive from Vienna and definitely worth a visit. Entry fees are moderate and the ticket is valid for the three main sites: Museum Carnuntum, Museum Bad Deutsch Altenburg, and the ""Amphitheater"" Bad Deutsch Altenburg.What if ruins have always been in the state they are now?

Also, more info on [Lichtenberg figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenberg_figure)! This may sound obvious, but if you see something like that happening, don't go near it. There's other people in this thread who said that, but I'm not sure if everyone knows the reason why. It's not just because the person telling you to stay away thinks you're stupid and going to accidentally touch the line. Being near the line can kill you, you don't have to actually touch the line to die. 

An energized wire on the ground causes something called ""step potential"". Basically, the voltage in the ground is high near the wire, and decreases the farther away from the wire you get. If your feet are apart, the voltage between your feet can cause a current to travel through your body. Maybe it'll injure you, maybe it'll kill you. If you need to get away from something like this, shuffle away with your feet together. They used to tell us you could also hop with your feet together, but I guess they don't trust us not fall over, because that would also probably kill you. 

tl;dr: Just being near a burning wire like this can kill you, even without actually touching it.[Who wants a body massage?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3GTNv9hHk)It's the Sha from WoW! Except real!I have had the experience of watching a high voltage line fall to the ground and arc several times after a rain storm. I was about 200' away when it fell. The sound, heat, and brilliant light was truly a thing to behold. The sound is a tortured and macabre screed in the most evil tone you've ever heard. The heat and light are incredibly intense. Unfortunately the sound drew my eyes directly to the fireball and it left an after image the persisted for several minutes. 

These underground vault fires are something special too. I have watched an attempt to put these out before. As I recall, it took this massive truck pumping insane quantities of CO2 into the vault to chill it before anyone could enter. 

http://youtu.be/0_jLmAB3leAReal Question: Shouldn't this wire be insulated?ShockingFractals. Crazy how they pop up over and over.Lineman here, can confirm, stay away. People,  voltage won't kill you, amperage will. The resistance of the ground changes everywhere, that's the reason for the lighting bolt pattern. What's cool is that along where the wire was on the ground (directly beneath the wire) it'll make crude glass, which looks pretty bad ass. 
Safety: NEVER touch a down wire. We are protected by step/touch potential by rubber over shoes gloves and sleeves, even then we still verify that the wire is de-energized before we touch it. Keep in mind de-energized does not mean that it's safe to touch. Had a worker bump a line with his leg that was down and de-energized but not properly grounded, didn't have his boots on because they were In a marsh and he got killed. Induced voltage from another line. If a wire is on the ground think of it as a bear or wolf, you get to close and it's going to maim and more often than not kill you... 

TL/DR: Never touch a wire on the ground, fear that shit like it's got a gun to your head. That's fracted up.Sha-touched groundA similar pattern grew on a CD I left in my car for over a year:

This is a great example showing why honey bees die after stinging something only once. Their stinger/venom sac are attached to other organs inside the bee, so when the stinger's barbs lodge into something, everything gets pulled out, potentially including gut, etc and leaving a gaping hole in the bees abdomen.

Another interesting fact: the stinger that gets left behind is composed of the stinger/barb, the venom sac, a layer of muscle tissue surrounding the venom sac and a nerve ganglion attached to the muscle. Independent of the bee, that nerve ganglion continues to contract the muscle around the venom sac, pumping more and more venom into the victim even if the bee has run off.  This is why when you get stung by a bee, you want to scrape the stinger out ASAP with a flat tool. (Don't try to pull it out with your fingers, you'll just squish the venom sac and empty it all in at once).[deleted]If I ever have a metal band, this will be the cover to my album.Spiderman.  Venom.

We mused on the idea of filling our apartment with foam, and then all sitting and studying in the waist high foam. So when the landlord came and said ""No foam parties!"" We'd all act really mad and say ""Excuse me does this look like a party? We all have exams tomorrow could you please leave?""
Fucking kids these days. When I was a kid I *knew* how to get in troubleI threw a Halloween party at my house in college once, 300some people showed up (we had a big house and a big fenced in yard)  It was wild, DJs, bouncers, girls dancing on the bar, 3 floors of madness.  It was awesome.

Well at about 2am the cops showed up in full force expecting to have to chase down tons of underage drinkers and drug users.  Thankfully we prepared.  When the cops showed up we had the 2 ""bouncers"" greet them and texted us that it was time to break up the time. 

I got on the DJ's mic and told everyone that the cops were here and wanted the party to end, but they didn't want trouble.  So I urged everyone to NOT run, as it creates a panicky atmosphere where cops and students are freaking out.  

All the students left, no arrest or citations, and even though I was underage, the cops left us with a verbal warning.  The head officer then came to me, shook my hand, and said great party and thanks for ending it so calmly.

We got to party like animals for 5 hours and it had 0 negative outcomes.

All the partiers were either in some music department or taking AP classes and headed to college next fall. 

We had the cops come into the backyard because of noise complaints/possible drinking/typical suburban problems. The first conversation they heard was about Cello and what it takes to play at a collegiate level between me and my friend.

Edit: couldn't find a video of a bitcoin on a RR engineSo smooth... Nice gif!My train has drunk homeless people, not nearly that smooth.I prefer American trains.  I can get on with a cup of fruit, and when I reach my stop, it's a smoothie.Smoothest ride I've ever had. It honestly feels like you're floating
But can they stop on a dime?Meanwhile on the Tokyo Metro

http://imgur.com/2j5rXx7In my three years of living in Japan I have missed out on so many opportunities to get karma.  TIL my office desk is as smooth as the bullet train in Japan, but much less expensive.That kind of experience will mess with my mind I can't even stand my coke bottle up on a train in the UK..Oh yea? well we have amtrak!I heard mention on the radio the other morning that we might be getting one here in Texas to run between Austin - Dallas - Houston. I'll be super excited if it works out.The speed makes me *shutter*This is growing more common around the world, it's impressive but at the same time, somewhat less remarkable if you live in a country with high speed trains (most European countries, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea etc.) Kind of sad how little attention this great technology is getting in North America. That coin is each one of us standing on the earth, only the earth is going at least 100 times faster than that train. Inertia is sound. Took me a couple minutes to realize its not loading a gifI've been on a few of these, and it might be nothing, but I noticed that we never passed another bullet train going the other way while in a tunnel. 

Too much air pressure?

meanwhile the train I take to NYC every day goes 60 mph and you have to keep a tight grip on your laptop so it doesn't go flying. We have literally had ZERO improvement to our railway system in 50 years.  When I took the train in Japan 30 years ago I remember thinking ""well, the US should have this in a couple years""Let me just hop on my table saw to compare.

The new model doesn't have a table. I was disappointed and almost went with Rav4 instead. The dealer said that's the number one complaint with the newer CRV's.

*edit: Almost went with the Rav4 for several reasons, not just the table. I have a coworker who was just trying to sell me his CRV.  His sales pitch?  ""It still has the fold out table!""my brother had a first-gen CR-V, and never had to change a tire for the first six years he had it. I was with him when he had his first flat, and when we took the trunk panel out to get the jack (spare was mounted on the back in this one), one of the legs came down because it was loose and we discovered the table.

Well the spare wasn't roadworthy either, so we sat in an empty parking lot, playing cards and drinking Mt. Dew on that table until AAA arrived.Oh I miss our CRV. This was so handy and simple. Pretty sturdy too, as foldable tables  go. For everyone as dumb as I am - [this is the INTERNAL spare tire cover (under the cargo area), not the EXTERNAL spare tire cover.](http://i.imgur.com/BQ0q0KA.jpg)I sold Hondas for about 6 months and one of our sales gimmicks on the CRV was to be like, ""Hey, check out the spare tire!"" and while they were like, ""Huh, spare tire."" We'd quickly set up the table behind them and be all like, ""Bam! Table!"" 

I think I sold 2 or 3 CRVs. I wouldn't fuck on that. Doesn't look stable to side-to-side motion.Holy crap!  I wonder when they started doing that.  I have a 2006 or 2007 that is in the shop right now (some asshole without insurance hit it).  I will have to check it, but I could swear mine is just a thin bit of wood with carpet on one side.-customer: ""What I really want is a vehicle tailored specifically for my needs""

Do you have anything like that?""Holy shit. There's a picnic table in my car too! I literally just walked out of work to go check because I didn't believe you, but there it was. I feel like they should tell you about these things when you buy the car.We almost bought a CRV years ago because of this feature.I had a '99 CR-V, and I remember the moment I got to the part in the manual (yeah, I read my car manuals) that mentioned it had a folding table. I was like, ""No way! No way!"" *pulls out folding table* ""OH MY GOD! THIS IS AWESOME!"". When I sold/gave the CR-V to my cousin, I made sure to point out it had a folding table several times.

I miss that table. :(

TL;DR ANOTHER harmless moth which happens to do an excellent job This is the Moth Hornet. A harmless horn...OH MY GOOOD!!! THE BLOOD! IT'S STINGER WENT RIGHT THROUGH MY ARM! LOOK AT ALL THE BLOOD!!  Evolution is abso-fucking-lutely amazing.
Shit I thought that thing was on a finger.. Looks like that's a grown mans arm!!! Fuck that shit.. Fuck it!!!!This is like those people who drive around used cop cars scaring everybody they see.How can something so cute look like such an asshole?

[EDIT]

I just thought about my ex-girlfriend.What's amazing about evolution is that it's a blind force, the moths genes don't know what a wasp looks like nor was there ever a conscious effort to look like a wasp. It just so happens that the moths which looked a little more like wasps were more successful...so amazing that a blind force can create visual matches How do you know it isn't Hornet Moth Hornet?

An evil hornet which happens to do an excellent job of looking like a hornet moth.Hey, that's a pretty damn cool adaptation, I would never have known it wasn't a hornet!

However, if I were to see one, it would be treated as a hornet. Sprayed with the closest aerosol can until it fell to the ground, and then ground up into little crunchy chunks =D. (I do not like fucking bees.)Didn't know they were fuzzy!This would have been an excellent evolutionary trait until humans came around and fucked it up.Little guy should be a spokesperson for Racial Profiling.Does it fly like a moth though? I can easily tell a moths wildly erratic flight paths vs. a hornet. Also, moths don't tend to buzz like bees. I'm curious to know how the two differ in flying techniques.My family and I were in the hot springs at Radium, BC a few months ago. There's a small island in the centre of the pool. My dad and I were sitting beside it, when I saw this thing on the island. It's big, black, and yellow. Jesus Christ. It's the Megawasp. He's come for our souls. None would stand in his way as he caused a full 30 seconds of sheer terror.

But there was one. A brave soul, destined to save the hot springs from the Megawasp Overlord. He remains unnamed, but his deeds are not forgotten. The Hero gathered his courage, and lifted the Megawasp out of the water *with his bare goddamn hands*.

Many would have destroyed the Megawasp there and then. But the Hero was too noble for such brute violence. He deposited the deposed insect on the border of the pool, wet but alive. The Overlord, humbled, flew away, never to be seen again.

At the time, none of us knew the truth about the Wasp Tyrant: he was no more than a harmless moth. Nevertheless, the Hero is galvanized in my mind as a true savior.

Never forget.I would be hopping on that NOPE train to FUCKTHATVILLE","{'Sadness': 0.035906, 'Emotional_Range': 0.86, 'Tentative': 0.639, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.537609, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.069, 'Agreeableness': 0.445, 'Joy': 0.041541, 'Disgust': 0.177565, 'Extraversion': 0.698, 'Openness': 0.219, 'Anger': 0.918548}","{'queen': 0.331812, 'wasp': 0.401312, 'bee': 0.549834, 'macro': 0.354344, 'insect': 0.987872}"

During the rectification of the Vuldrini, OP decorated his house  as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new house decoration for OP: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! What did you do Ray?Are you a god?What did you do, /u/ColoradoMovieCars, *what did you DO?*Former *Ghostbusters* (1984) crew member here. It's funny you used an inflatable because the actual Stay-Puft Man that you see in the movie is an inflatable prop, which was a last-minute replacement. It was originally supposed to be Anthony Daniels in a rubber suit walking around a miniature NYC, and to do the test shoots I had modified this cheap inflatable rubber prop from an old Michelin Man. Basically we heated it up, smoothed out the bumps, stuck a sea cap on it and then blew it up and draw a cartoony face with a sharpie.

The day we were to shoot the actual scene with Tony Daniels in the costume, Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd dropped by and watched us do the test scenes using the rubber prop on the miniature city. The way that it kind of bumped around as we tried to guide it through the motions using strings looked so comically surreal that they decided to shoot the actual scene in the movie using a full scale version of my inflatable. We re-purposed an old Michelin Man float from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and it took the entire art department two weeks to make the giant float look like my 7-ft model and we had to run cables from the roofs several nearby buildings to control the motion (the filming permits in Manhattan were a nightmare) but in a way I guess you could say that the iconic appearance of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was my brainchild. Kinda neat when you think about it.

By the way, Anthony Daniels was a total pro about it, these things just happen on set sometimes and you can't take it personally. He actually later thanked me because a vision of Gozer the Gozerian came to him in a vision that night and told him he would have been trapped and died of heat stroke if he had entered the costume.

Just imagining what beautiful misè-en-scenes of the world that are out there right now is as good as actually seeing them, in my opinion.

It was amazing to walk around the old city and just see beautiful building after beautiful building.*hums Castlevania theme*This reminded me of final fantasy 9My SO and I were in Prague for a few days last year.  
  
Stunning architecture, great food & drink, quaint markets but, bloomin' hundreds of identical souvenir shops, poor museums, expensive and poorly stocked art galleries.  
  
I felt like it didn't live up to the massive ""hype"" that seems to surround the place?  
  
Did we miss something?And here we have the opening scene of every vampire/castlevania game/movie ever made.I'm just back from Prague.

I went over there 8 weeks ago just for 3 days.

Returned there last week because I simply had to.

It's a cracking city.

So much to do (especially if you like good food & beer) and cheap enough that you don't have to worry about doing it.

Girls are stunning too.Y'all see darkness, I see my childhood.

http://youtu.be/CMaYkN78hOYI live nearby, many tourists actually think that cathedral looks like Disney land lol Tyn Church and the Old Town Hall on the right. Really great area of the city.Awesome picture OP.Gorgeous photo!  I don't know if the photographer planned out and waited for this shot or just got lucky, but this is fantastic.  I'd love to see it again with a little touching up to remove noise and improve the contrast.

That neon hotel sign is kind of an amusing contrast next to all this older architecture.Great photo!Full moon? I can see knedlík <3Beautiful. Did you take this photo? Why was I expecting a butt in the sky?Every time I see or hear about Prague only one thing comes to mind...
Vampire: The Masquerade Redemption.I studied there for a little over a month one summer and did an internship there.  It's an absolutely incredible city.  It's very difficult to find the same level of historical significance, beautiful architecture, insane nightlife, and low prices anywhere else.  I would recommend it to anyone thinking of traveling to Europe.  It's already starting to become more touristy, and I fear that it won't have the same enchanting appeal that it does now once it becomes overrun the way places like Paris have.

I have been 10 years old for at least a decade now...For anyone curious, the photo is taken from The Charles Bridge, a bridge much older than the United States itself.

Was this bridge where they shot the scene in Mission Impossible? /r/movies?Charles Bridge is where my wife and I shared our first kiss at 5am one winter night in 2006. We had spent the night wandering the city, going into pubs, chatting at a mile a minute amazed the connection we were finding. She told me as the night wore on that she always wished she could see Charles Bridge like it is in the postcards (or this picture, for that matter) with lovely light and no people. Karluv Most is normally packed full of tourists, trinket sellers and tramps. Feeling bold, I told her that if she went there with me right then instead of going home that I promised it would be just like the postcards. Sure enough, there wasn't a single soul on the bridge. And just as the sun started to rise, after touching the lucky St. John of Nepomuk statue, we kissed. There was no way we weren't getting married after that.

Amazing architecture and the cheapest beer you will ever find.

But don't go expecting to find the Charles bridge that empty. It's pretty much always packed. Instead, at dusk go stop in a sideshop, pick up a few beers, and spend the night drinking in Old Town Square until the wee hours of the morning.

Also, for a great drinking place with stellar view of the Charles Bridge and the Prauge Castle there is a beer garden on the bank of the river to the south east of the Bridge. Don't remember the name but check it out.  [This is the stellar view from my less than stellar phone camera](http://i.imgur.com/FiYV0cH.jpg)I love Prague.

The agent they sent to investigate told us they were more worried about the seemingly crazy neighbor than the dog. I remember thinking as a kid that my cat and dog would always get cold during the winters so I would always try to force them into bed with me so I can cover them with my blankets. One was a part husky part wolf breed. And my cat always attacked me. I was not a smart kid.It's a Husky for crying out loud they love the winter

edit... holy crap this exploded

edit 2. Thank you kind person for the month of gold! My first gilded commentdamn that's a cold ass huskyNeighbor - ""It's too cold for your dog to be outside!""

You - ""Yeah, that's how my Grandmother died.""

Neighbor - ""From being left out in the cold?""

You - ""No, from not minding her own fucking business.""Last winter I tied my Siberian husky with about thirty feet of line to a tree in my front yard while I shoveled the driveway. My neighbors did this really passive aggressive bullshit where they stood by their door almost out of earshot and said things like ""he better not be leaving that dog out there tied up in the snow"". 

She's only tied up because if I don't, it's a two hour marathon chasing her around the yard in the snow, because she will refuse to go inside. If I leave her in while I'm outside in the snow she sits at the front window and cries.

But out of all that, what baffles me the most is, it's ok for a human from a moderately hot climate to be outside for hours shoveling snow, but an animal bred in Siberia has to be inside.Do your neighbors bring all of the neighborhood coyotes and raccoons inside to sleep with them?Our Great Pyr is the same way.  Last year during one of the Polar Vortex spells, it got down to -35 degrees - the damn dog STILL refused to come inside.  Your neighbors are idiots... It's not hard to figure out that a SIBERIAN husky likes the cold. I had two huskies growing up. I got an anonymous not in the door one day when I was home from school about how it was ""cruel to have [my] dogs cry and whine in the cold while [I] sat inside a warm house"". That person obviously didn't see the 15 times I let them inside for all of 5 minutes before they started panting, overheating and scratching or whining at the door to be let out. They didn't care about the cold they just wanted to be with me, but fuck me if I was going to spend another 2 hours out in -30C with them.I had a husky/wolf hybrid — when it snowed, he got *so ridiculously happy*.He's not husky he's just big boned. This reminds me of that one ignorant white-knight redditor who stole one of these ""freezing"" dogs.My neighbors have huskies.  I've got not problem with them staying out when it is cold.  I just get kind of annoyed when they are out an it is 100+I had an Akita- German Shepherd mix, she loved the winter, she'd run happily through the snow all day. On the -30 days she'd be just as happy, she used to tease the American bulldog the neighbour had because he didn't like walking through the snow until she padded the snow down enough he could walk through it without it touching him, I sure loved that dog and miss her every day :-( My friends neighbours said the same thing about his husky.  The SPCA came to his house because she complained they were neglecting the dog.  My friend showed them the heated water dish and they laughed it off and played with her for an hour in the snow.Your neighbours are crazy. Dogs are bred for different environments. A husky in the snow is just as natural as a Chihuahua in the heat. Of course within reason for both cases.

True abuse is when you see someone in Fla buy a husky and wonder why it's so lazy. Or an Alaskan with a Chihuahua wonder why their dog shakes so much. Other breeds merely adopted the snow; Huskies are born in it, moulded by it. They don't see the grass until July.snow is an insulator, thats warmer than the concrete We had a Bernese mountain dog and the days when it snowed were the happiest of his life. The colder and windier, the better.   
 I remember one day when it was snowing so much, you could barely see 3m in front of you. He was in the yard and bang on the door, but when someone came to open it he'd run away and jump around in the snow again. We were all sitting in the living room by the fireplace and he'd look at us with ~5cm snow on his head, as if he wanted to say ""Are you crazy sitting near the hot thing? It's fucking *snowing* out here! Come out"". Maybe your dog howls and barks a lot, I hear huskies are pretty noisy dogs. A friendly reminder from the American Veterinary Medical Association:

*Cats and dogs should be kept inside during cold weather. It’s a common belief that dogs and cats are more resistant than people to cold weather because of their fur, but it’s untrue. Like people, cats and dogs are susceptible to frostbite and hypothermia and should be kept inside. Longer-haired and thick-coated dog breeds, such as* **huskies and other dogs bred for colder climates, are more tolerant of cold weather; but no pet should be left outside for long periods of time in below-freezing weather.**

It gets all pixelated when I set it as the wallpaper on my desktop.From the Vimeo video:

> ""Black Hole"" is a series of images, which shows paint modeled by the centripetal force. The setup is very simple: Various shades of acrylic paint are dripped onto a metallic rod, which is connected to a drill. When switched on, the paint starts to move away from the rod, creating these amazing looking structures.
The motion of the paint happens in a blink of an eye, the images you see are taken only millisecond after the drill was turned on. To capture the moment, where the paint forms that distinctive shape, I connected a sensor to the drill, which sends an impulse to the flashes. These specialized units are capable of creating flashes as short as a 1/40000 of a second, freezing the motion of the paint.

The little alleyways that run around the whole area has so many famous little vendors. There's also this one museum that houses a ton of different horror masks. Apparently the person that runs it sees these ghosts in his dreams, which tell him to make a mask of what they look like so the world knows who they are. There's upwards of over 500 different masks in this place and worth the ~$2 to get in[Here's the same angle](http://www.gaytaipei4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/things-to-do-jiufen.jpg) without all the ridiculous HDR/Saturationit's really a magical little island. it's this incredibly bizarre and unique combination of super-rural and ultra-modern that i haven't seen anywhere else. It's kinder and cleaner than  china and friendlier and more relaxed than japan. It has often has the feeing of a tiny little south pacific nation in the middle of nowhere while Taipei feels like a Science Fiction film from the 80s.  I remember seeing a little smiling fisherman in his taiwan sandals returning to port in his beat up little boat, watching something on an ipad. And everyone on the most atrocious, beat up little scooters because hey, these work? Why get a new one?

I can see where miyazaki got the the strange timeless, placeless yet incredibly homelike and familiar feel.Heya, thats near here!  I live about 45 minutes from Jiufen.  Street level, its a neat maze of alleyways and tea shops, but its also very touristy, especially on weekends.


There is a place, hidden away somewhere up a staircase I can never find, where a guy has his gallery of ghost masks.  He has been tormented by visions of ghosts his whole adult life and deals with it by making clay masks of them.  He doesn't sell them, but if you find him when his doors are open he'll be glad to show you.  [There are *thousands* of them] (http://myitchyfingers.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/house-of-more-ghost-masks-jiufen/)
this makes me want to eat at one of the restaurants like the parenst that turned into pigsI want to go to there.I've never even thought about going to Taiwan (except for love of dumplings, maybe) but this totally makes me want to visit. Be sure to try some sweet [taro ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro_ball) while visiting Jiufen. They're some of my favorite movies. [Here](http://buzzotaku.com/2014-05/places-inspired-9-ghibli-movies.html) is a list of places that supposedly inspired other Ghibli movies.

too crowded and touristy these days, all the artists moved out of the area alreadyI was there earlier this year, the ride up was interesting but the buses, alleys, shops and restaurants were overcrowded. Mostly due to the massive mainland tourist groups. I wasn't aware that Jiufen was the inspiration for that movie, good to know!One of my all time favorite films. I will really miss Studio Ghibli. HDR GALOREI lived in Taiwan for 4 years, my gf and I are HUGE Ghibli fans and watch Spirited Away at least once a year but I only found out about this town last month... and missed the opportunity to go there. Hopefully next year.Lived in Taiwan for several years.  Love this place.  It's like your in a movie.I had the pleasure of being able to go there, but there was like a typhoon blowing in when I did so it was kind of miserable. But the cool thing is that the streets are so tightly packed together that it's like walking down a hallway with roofs almost always covering you. There are all sort of interesting shops and food stands as well. Honestly the rain gave it even more of a sort of mystical noiry feel that I won't ever forget it. But it sure sucked standing in the wind and rain at a bus stop for almost an hour. That and annoying main-landers. T_TTHANK YOU for posting this picture! I visited this place years ago with a friend and I could never remember the name of it. FINALLY I know where I went!/r/shittyHDR I used to live close by... apparently the Taiwanese care less than the internet, because now one ever told me :(

To be serious, my wife was a programmer of a sort. She was carrying the monthly updates from the lab to the CS card-reader room when she tripped. 

3000 and more punched cards scattered over the corridor floor.

It was an inevitable event but she sat there crying, as she carefully and patiently picked them up and re-ordered them. 

I hugged her lots that night. 

 Hey kid! I'm a computah'.That's the Amazon box for a micro SD card these days.I worked for a division of the DoD back in 2003.

They bought a very big SGI server - bigger than a double door fridge-freezer (I forget the specs, but it was extremely powerful for the time, with (I think) 32 CPUs and a few GB of RAM). I was a couple of million bucks.

Anyway, they had to get it up onto the second floor of this difficult to access building. Somewhere, there is a photo of this thing on a forklift going to max height, being lifted by another forklift going to max height.

I once worked on the ILLIAC IV which had a 50-foot unibus.  It was front-ended by a bunch of PDP35 computers and was just monumentally huge.  It was supposed to be used for analyzing the enormous amounts of weather data available, but we always suspected military uses, of course.

Some years later, I was reading an airline magazine and ran across an article about the ILLIAC IV being transported to the Smithsonian.  After that, I just stared out the window for a while.

When I was working in the computer business, I mostly worked for companies that sold computers to newspapers and publishers.  This was when there was the big changeover from Linotype machines and melted lead to computerized plates for the printing press.  We were astounded by having a 50-mb disk drive!  It was so huge!  Of course, the down side was putting a lot of people out of work.  Some were re-trained to the ""computer side"" but others either couldn't or wouldn't.  At the time, it was probably a selling-point that it was so small. http://www.historyoftelecommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mark_1.jpgThank god they clarified that it was an **Electronic** computer. I hate being scammed by these people saying they're giving you a computer and you get an abacus in the mail.It wasn't much different up until the personal computers came out. They sometimes also just cut a hole in the ceiling for these mainframes and just lowered them in with a crane.I got my computer off the back of a truck too.The CPU for mainframes used to be delivered by armored car.

""Oops, sorry.  WOOO!  FREE SPEECH!""Do chinese protesters get any negative feedback from the public.   Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining myself.  Basically, for any form of large protest that gets momentum, people in America say things like 'those bums, should get a job'.

They better be careful before they open up a portal to the digital world. nice bokehThis might get buried but, I'm wondering, what if there was (or is) an app that worked like firechat and synched phones via Bluetooth in a way that would cause all phones to, effectively in union, be used as a massive speaker?

 There could be client apps and very few host apps. Client(mob) apps job receive and play message via Bluetooth from the pushing host.

Pair it with another discussion site and collectively decide on a message or messages. 

Fire chat may even be used to contact a pusher (speaker message sender) when a situational message needs to be played.

 I.e. just how we have 911 in the u.s. they can have a specific adress codes can be sent to. Codes to shorten the length of typing out what's happening.

Which again could be discussed at a similar place the message is.

Just a thought..


Until they run out of batteryAmazing picture. I can imagine their Beyond theme song playing. 

I love the protest, but I honestly fear for the repercussions should China not budge and things escalates to violence from either side.  I have talked with several HK residents about the protests and they think it is ridiculous. Granted these are older folks so maybe the younger ones have a different viewpoint. One thing I was wondering is when the British ruled they had no elections. Why are they protesting now when there are limited elections? Is there a HK law that says they can pick their own candidates to vote on?Was in Hong Kong earlier this year.

The city is already beautiful; I would love to witness this in person.Fuck yeah HK! Much love to the HK demonstrators. We did the same thing at a Black Keys concert and they came back for an encore. It was pretty cool. It would be nice of these images could be beamed into China and to get them to rise up against their oppressive government.You know, this would be a great time to test what happens when the entire Chinese population jumps up and down at the same time.The highway is alive tonight.....How do you guys think that China will handle this?

I'm currently working on a research project with these, and their competitors,  the Christie VeinViewer. This one pictured is crap due to the laser light - it portrays the vein size incorrectly.  

The Christie device works much better. You can actually strip the vein of blood and watch it refill to look for valves. It like the difference between analog TV and HD. 

Also, it requires a slight change in technique. If you can ""feel/see"" the vein you don't need a stinking light. I've been able to hit veins in weird places, on fat people,  black people, jaundiced skin, you name it. 

For all of you haters, I hear most of the complaints from old bitter nurses who bitch about everything.  They try it one time, and then give up and announce that it is a crap device. You need to practice with it!

SHOGGOTHS! RUN!I'm gonna take out my shovel and hope I get good treasure.Looked like spiders. I don't like spiders. Much more interesting than the leaf shaped holes: the ice also formed a Voronoï diagram. The melting extended radially. And where two melting zones meet, a Voronoï edge is visible. The diagram shows all the points on the ice that are equally distant from two leaves!

Science!I knew it, pitfall seeds..Break out the shovel! There are pitfall seeds and fossils in that river!Oh my god, it's full of stars...What a beautiful effect to capture. Just nature being awesome!Sure that's what happened. There are obviously a  bunch of fossils and gyroids down there.. Seeing this kinda made me think of the manga *Enigma of the Amigara Fault* by Junji Ito.  Creepy.
[LINK](http://openawesome.com/junji-ito-horror-manga/enigmaofamigarafault.html)We had this swampy area where I grew up that did this one spring. Then another layer of ice formed on top. One of my friends fell through and was stopped by the second layer. 

So then we all purposefully broke through! Leaving.

That's why people were always so fucking attractive back then.  I just thought we as a species were getting uglier.I was surprised to see James Sharp credited with retouching the photo, since Hurrell was the photographic author. This seems to be true, however, Hurrell was a painter, photographer, and most importantly, a photo retouch artist and inventor. He developed many proprietary techniques used in his glamor shots, such as the one shown in this post. James Sharp would have been a retouch artist working under the supervision of Hurrell, using Hurrell designed equipment and techniques.

A lot of the tool icons in Photoshop have their origins in photo retouching toolsThat really changes my perspective of some movie stars from that era. 

I mean, that easily takes off 10 or more years. In six hours, he made it appear as though Joan Crawford had never made another facial expression in her life. I'd like to see someone photoshop the photo on the left and see how closely they can get it to the one on the right.[Colorized.](http://i.imgur.com/LKc8SHA.jpg)I always just assumed that people were better looking back then...In film they would smear the camera lenses with vasoline to give the actors and actresses smoother facial features tooLooks like Amy Poehler with a bad wax job.Interesting that the practice of pretty-ifying pictures is so commonplace that we start out with a negative prefix as 'standard'.I have a really interesting book called ""The Commissar Vanishes"" about the use of photo retouching in the U.S.S.R. 

There are photos that undergo numerous revisions over the years as individuals fall out of favor (or occasionally back in favor) with the current rulers. Some of the edits are comically bad, but many are quite well done, and you wouldn't know someone was missing unless you saw the ""before"".Is anyone else bothered by the  ""un-retouched"" phrase? Maybe I am wrong, but doesn't ""untouched"" seem more correct?Spent 6 hours on it. Probably would take 10 minutes now on PSdamn joan crawford was hotUnretouched and retouched.""Untouched"" is a tad misleading. There's still studio lighting and a really good camera/lens that you have to keep in mind.

It looks like Earth a lot more than I expected, just a deserted and barren area somewhere. Looks a lot like Arizona actually.This is a colour image from Mars. It looks like it could have been taken somewhere on Earth, perhaps somewhere not far from your own home. The reality of it is that our eyes will probably never come across anything more alien and far removed from our daily existence as this picture of the Martian landscape. It was taken by a robot, in an atmosphere that kill us almost immediately. The image was encoded and beamed at the speed of light, in the form of electromagentic radiation, from Mars, and received and decoded on Earth, to form this image.

There never been an era before, in the history of the human race, when primates have had the ability to see something, in such detail, from so far away. Let this be a reminder that we live in incredible times, and that 30 years from now, the level of technology will be seen to be as dated as the16 bit, 12MHz processor of the 80286 CPUs from about 30 years ago. 

Between now and our future, some things will progress at exponential rates, others will appear to not change much at all. The only thing we can be certain of, is that our world will be, at least as different then, as today is to the 1980's.

The only thing I think we can safely predict is this: The porn will be SPECTACULAR!Don't lie, that's just Unreal Engine 4!Hey Mars! Get a tree!Without doubt, one of the most mind blowing images I have seen in my life. 
This is ANOTHER PLANET for feck sake!!!Took me a while of staring at it to realize how fucking awesome this picture is. I mean, it's fucking Mars. Another planet. Far fucking away. Do you even know what that means? Millions of miles away. Your probably never gonna see the fucking place. Not a single human has set foot there. It's in OUTER FUCKING SPACE!Everyone has a new desktop wallpaper Its so boring! Grow some space stuff or something.I would live there, but not raise my kids there.This picture honestly amazes me. This looks like it could be a random desert somewhere but its actually another fucking planet. It looks very peaceful.I just saw Mars, in color, on my phone, while laying in bed. What a fucking crazy time to be alive. what is this blue light?I still want to HEAR what Mars sounds like....you know, if there's a breeze at all...

I guess all I want to hear is the wind.. or, better yet, put an external speaker on a rover, and record what it sounds like in the thin atmosphere when you play music or voices.Extremely awesome.  One of my pet peeves is how almost every astronomy photo is false color.  Usually coloring different wavelengths normally outside of the visible spectrum.  While those details are very important for science, they are misleading to the public.Looks like an instagram photo of some desert here on earth.This is awesome.  Still, it kinda looks like San Bernardino, in Southern California.

Every single photo I see from Mars still amazes me! I occasionally show my mates and they dont seem to care much...do you not understand how amazing this is?!?!

I'm pretty sure this isn't real tilt-shift-photography but just a photoshopped blur. If it was real, the top of the right balloon wouldn't be blurred.

EDIT: As some people pointed out, I might be wrong about the top of the right balloon. It could indeed also be blurred in a real tilt photograph. I would like to add though that with a properly adjusted tilt and focus, it would well be possible to have all the balloons in focus - same holds for a shopped effect on the other hand. So let's conclude: this is a pretty picture, but it could have been done better, and it's photoshopped even though the effect could have been the same with a real tilt/shift lens - the bokeh would just have looked a bit more ""real"".

This is what was in each box. One pack of pens, tons of packing air and a slip.

Edit: Turns out I only got 33. 12 more to go. :/Oh man, that's a ton of boxe***JESUS WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING ON ON YOUR STEP???***Chances are good these are ""ship from store"" items, and the pens were clearance. If your order was over x dollar amount, shipping is still free, but they're discontinued items sitting on the shelf(or peg, as the case may be) at a random store. They all show coming from Ohio because they return to the regional Distribution Center, rather than each individual store/show that as a shipping address, as the individual stores are not setup to receive return orders via mail/UPS, etc.

It's cost inefficient for such small items, but we do a lot of business with UPS so the contract for this process makes it not as much of a loss as it looks like. Also, you now have 45 packages of pens that we were trying to get rid of! Everyone wins.

Source: I may have shipped some of those pens to you.I'm glad someone out there picks the pumpkins with skin deformities. I always felt bad. I worked for an online business that sold office supplies. They were just the store front and didn't do the fulfillment. The logic in their application was to write a separate record in to the transaction table for each item. If you ordered 12 rolls of paper towels there were twelve records written in the database, there was no concept of ""Qty"" in the record.

The fulfillment company called us up and said to stop doing that or they'd drop out contract. Apparently their policy was to box up each invoice line item in a separate box... 12 rolls of paper towels became 12 individual shipments. I can finally tell this story! 

A couple years ago I worked as a developer in a large company that did custom print services. One day a high-priority ticket passed through the Production Incident queue, as an automated check in the fulfillment system noticed a weird problem with an order that was shipped out.

A customer had purchased 500 custom posters for $1500. Someone in the shipping department sent the posters all in _individual_ boxes to the customer at a cost of something like $4500. if someone had tried to steal these, can you imagine how confused and disappointed they would be when they figured out all you got were pens.[deleted]You are now the King of Pen Island.I'm going to be homeless soon, I should do this to get free boxes.

When you ordered these pens they are clearance (we stopped selling office supplies years ago) so our dot com sources from any stores that have them. Some stores have one or two and they would be shipped that way. The return address doesn't show the store that they were shipped for nor can you know to prevent employee fraud (someone orders pens out of a store a friend works at and he puts an iPad in).

Most experienced climbers doubted that it ever would be climbed. Superstitious natives believed there was a ruined city on the summit inhabited by demons and spirits of the damned.

>It was finally successfully scaled in 1865 by the Englishman Edward Whymper and six others. The triumph was marred by the most famous mountaineering tragedy of all time--a tragedy that nearly put a halt to the sport. On the descent, the second man on the rope slipped, knocking the first man over; the third and fourth were dragged violently along. The rope broke and the four men were hurled down, falling from precipice to precipice, to the Matterhorn Glacier, almost 4,000 ft. below. Immediately after the accident, the three survivors saw an illusion of three crosses in the clouds, which, they reasoned later, must actually have been a fogbow.

>Eventually the furor over the accident died down, and in the years since, the Matterhorn has been climbed from every possible angle by over 60,000 people, including women, children, octogenarians, blind men, and a mountaineer who later became Pope Pius XI.As someone from Southern California, that looks familiar.[And here it is under construction.](http://i.imgur.com/XSGTodO.png)

Made by Wim Noorduin of Harvard University.

X-Posted to /r/UnusualArt - full disclosure, I'm a mod there, but I'd love it if any of you guys came to check us out!

**Explanation of how these are made:**

>These ""flowers"" were created by mixing **barium chloride (***BaCl2***)**and **sodium silicate (**\of the general formula: *Na2(SiO2)n***\)**, also known as waterglass, in a beaker of water. The resulting reaction combines with carbon dioxide in the air to create crystals made of barium carbonate in the water.

>Noorduin found that as the crystals self-assembled, he could control their shape, size and direction of growth by altering the temperature, the amount of carbon dioxide allowed into the reaction and the acidity of the water.

>Increasing the carbon dioxide levels creates the broad, flat leaves of those mineral flowers, for example.

Edit: Yes, the image is in false colour.

Edit2: I emailed the author, he replied with this:

>Dear Karmaneutrino,

>Many thanks for your kind email. Thanks for submitting the image to reddit. It is really great to see how enthusiastic people are about the work, I'm really impressed by the amount of positive attention.

I can die happy.Say ay to da UP, eh?I went to the UP for my senior trip after I graduated, two weeks at a cabin with no electricity or running water was one of the best decisions I could have ever made.Michigan, very few and small wild fires, no hurricanes, the worst earthquake was like a .5, no mudslides, no tsunamis, one or two small tornadoes per year.
We do have four seasons, we are surrounded by fresh water and have hundreds of thousands of acres of farm land along with hundreds of thousands of acres of national and state forest.What is reflected in the bottom right corner of the road? I don't understand what I'm seeing.Make sure you check out Presque Isle Park when you get into Marquette and Jump off the Blackrocks. There is some amazing local beer there as well, Blackrocks brewery and Ore dock brewing company. Loooooove the UP, did a few vacations up there and decided to do a before & after photo of the Porcupine Mountains during the summer and the fall when the trees begin to shift their color.  It's so beautiful.

Best stuff I came across?

1) Japanese clients taking a shower outside the bathtub...on wooden floor from the 12th century. Yes, they had to pay for it.

2) Crazy client taking tiny dumps of shit all over the room...and then covering it up with tiny toilet paper ""tents"". Never found out why he did that.

3) Crazy client checking in at our luxury boutique hotel...just to then show up NAKED at reception at 3am saying he wants to ""check out"". His family collected him later that night. Turns out he was a rich dude who escaped from a mental asylum.

In short, hotel guests can be hilarious :DThat's where the magic happens.Ah, the ol ""having sex in magic cards"" fetish.

edit: Welp, that's a tub (DAMN THAT'S A LOT OF CARDS)

I'll keep my original post up in all it's glory.as someone who loves the smell of fresh magic cards...10/10 id bathe in this.

EDIT: scientists, I think the world is ready for an MTG CCG cologne. Get on that pleaseI can actually offer a theory on this. I stayed at a hotel in Montreal with my brother and some friends, and one of the days we bought a shit ton of magic packs and just drafted all day long. By the end of the day, we had stacks and stacks of commons and uncommons that none of us needed because we don't play much anymore, so we just left them. If we threw them in the tub, it would be fairly close to this. But this... this is fucking ridiculous.  That is one epic rage quit. Decisions were made. Came in to town for a Magic tournament, lost his life savings when he got knocked out of it and gambled on the remainder of the games.  
In a fit of depression he decided to fill the bathtub with his cards, pour them over with gasoline, and light it on fire as he lay in there, a fitting grave for a man who's Magic addiction ultimately killed him.  
But when it came down to it, when it really came down to him holding the matches in his hand, he just couldn't do it.  
A dark chapter of his life over, he heads home, and after arriving back at his parents' house although they don't comment on the absence of his bags full of cards, the cards that have caused him so much heartache over the years, they both notice it. Over the newspaper their gazes lock, and they allow themselves a quick and nervous smile.  
The day the Magic died became the day he was truly born.

I had this badass '92 Toyota Supra turbo.  Loved that car. Fast, comfortable, awesome.  

Every time I mentioned how much I liked that car over any of my other cars (had some 80's mustangs, and even a Porsche '944) everyone just shut me down. 

""Oh a toyota huh?  yeah yeah.""

It's like everyone thought it was just a Carolla with a turbo.

I finally ended up selling it due to travelling (military) about four months before F&F#1 came out.

I bought the car for $6k. I sold it for $5500.

One week after that movie came out asking price on those Supras was well over 15k.

Here's me for the next year ""KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!""

Just had to get that off my chest.

[Here's a really neat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AYVHIp8Qtc) of someone driving down it during a storm. It's awesome!The joke in Norway is that everyone *knows* that their little island town is *the best place* in the *entire* world. That is, until they finally build a bridge to it and everyone moves away.Reminds me of [Advance Wars](http://www.edge-online.com/wp-content/uploads/edgeonline/oldfiles/images/feature_article/2010/04/advance_wars_5.png).That'd be awesome driving that daily!

1. Ferguson isn't the only protest ever to have a bunch of stuff to clean up afterwards
2. Some people in Ferguson are and a lot are protecting the stores from getting looted. Crips and bloods have even been seen working together to stop looting but the media only shows the violent partsVery organized and peaceful protests rarely make governments initiate the wanted reforms. But this is against China which will do nothing regardless of how peaceful or chaotic the protests are.Perhaps the ""Occupy"" crowd could take notes.The pictures the racists ignore, the same thing happening in Ferguson, Missouri.

Problem was we had NO idea how to boil eggs, so they all cracked in the water, and then we couldn't figure out how to get them (and the egg goop) out of the pot. As it turns out, pots full of water are incredibly heavy for an 8 year old to lift. So while we're spilling boiling water all over the kitchen, the toaster is now on fire because we forgot the toast (and also obviously had no idea how to set a toaster or anything).

All in all, a giant disaster. Parents came running when the fire alarm went off, and started yelling thinking we were just playing and making a huge mess for fun. We both started crying immediately and pleading that we were *just* trying to do something nice. Then our mom taught us to properly boil eggs but we never tried to do it ever again after that fiasco.I wouldnt be surprised if your parents expected that to happen.

Edit : No. It doesnt matter if he was white, black, mexican. Whether he was short, tall, fat, or skinny. What does matter is he was an innocent ~~Canadian citizen~~ Human being. That must be such a weird feeling. Having a brief but positive interaction with a stranger, never expecting to see them again, which happens so often to everyone. And then finding out that they're dead.

Thanks for the source, OP, you do good work.as a Canadian, i just want to say thank you for the kindness America. watching Oh Canada being sung in tribute at the Pittsburgh/Philli hockey game tonight choked me up.""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""

RIP a good man.  Stay strong Canada.This is how it should be. Mourn the loss of the victim rather than celebrate the psycho. This shot packs a bit more punch than the others I've seen because the humanness is so much more obvious. In this picture he just seems like a normal guy, doing his thing: enjoying his time at work, having put on his uniform, making small chat with strangers and genuinely enjoying himself, probably looking forward to whatever his evening plans are...  And suddenly    Boom. Gone.  For no reason. 

This is as upsetting as it is unsettling. I hope his family are in good hands - I think they would love to see pictures from visitors to Ottawa, possibly from all over the world, who have taken their picture with him.

This is what we need moving on, unity. Stay strong everyone and my condolences to all.R.I.P. My heart aches.. I understand that a 5 year-old lost their daddy todayA few points for people that don't know:

- He's wearing a kilt and a Glengarrian (his funny looking hat) because of the specific Regiment that he's a part of. Only a few units are Highlanders, as previously mentionned, and none of them are in the Regular Force (the full-time-all-the-time army/navy/air force)

- He was a great man, who I had the pleasure of working with a few years ago. Always cheery and a good troop

- To get to be a sentry at that memorial is an honor beyond description. It's nationally advertised across the Elements (Army/Navy/Air Force) and across the components and sub-components (Regular Force, Primary Reserve, etc.). You have to be an outstanding Soldier, Sailor or Airman to be selected. 3 Weeks of training for your 1 week of being on the job.

[here is what he was guarding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier)Aw, fuck. He looks so fucking happy, just tears me to shreds. This would be a great shot for his family to see. He's obviously loving what he's doing, but so sad he had to die doing it.

CUT    INSIDEIt would probably be an electrician.  Framers are generally done and gone before the electricians come in and only have a vague idea where the electrical runs will go.Yeah, doesn't always work. I remember in a place where I used to work, where there was some construction going on in part of the building, but live fibre optic cable running across the ceiling through the area, we had made sure the foreman knew about it, and he had gone to the trouble of writing DO NOT CUT in large flourescent pink writing about a foot tall on both sides.

Suffice to say it took 2 days of round the clock work to resplice all the fibres after some moron cut through all 72 pairs, in two places, with a chainsaw.

Looks like a truss brace.  Wouldn't wanna cut it even if there were no wires running behind it.  Of course you wouldn't want to cut up any part of a pre-engineered truss.  I have framed houses for 16 years but the thought never occurred to me to warn homeowners about removing vital structural components of the house.  That plank of wood is just asking to be cut!Yeah because once you break someone's truss it's very hard to get it back to it's original strength. Or maybe you should figure out how things are put together before you go sawing on stuff all willy nilly.Better yet: photograph every wall and mark wiring, pipe, and support locations before the drywall goes up. The company I used to work for would do this and make a binder of photos to give the owners. Saves a lot of effort and screwups if something ever needs fixing or remodeling and they can't read a plan.If the only time you don't cut through boards in your walls is when you find a note from a benevolent carpenter, you're gonna have a bad time.Gotta comment your code.You should always look before you cut anywayIts handy, sure.. But its no cockenballs.

Most inscriptions I see behind drywall are most certainly crude depictions of male genitalia.Electrician here. 
32% chance it will be cut by a plumber or tinbasher (guys who install ductwork)
It's inevitable. Even with a sign..Electrician here. That is all low voltage data wiring, which is usually the last of the trades to rough in before sheetrock. They wrote on the board to prevent plumbers and electricians from drilling holes thru the wires. In practice running the wires hidden like this is asking for trouble but good guy low voltage guy came thru . What were you going to cut it for?As a carpenter I often think its only a matter of time before code requires us to make load bearing walls obvious to future DIY.  Probably have to paint the studs orange or something.In case anyone runs around cutting random beams in their house?If you're a low voltage wiring guy and run wires like that in new construction. You're an idiot why are you thanking them for not using conduit...?What kind of unconscious asshole saws through anything without inspecting it. Regardless it could be structural, you fucking menace.Don't worry, the plumber will blow through them all with his 3"" hole saw and run his vent in that exact location. Error:  A network cable is unplugged.as someones that works in the trades (commercial and industrial) its  common practise to look before you cut.

i blast big 4-5 inch holes through concrete and brick walls weekly and a lot of thought goes into the location of the hole.  you dont just drill a hole without looking whats on the other side or even whats running through the brick.

on most job sites this kind of marking would be unnecessary because people dont just randomly start cutting things without looking. 

of course this picture is residential and we all know most people that work in the residential sector are basically high functioning monkeys that know just enough code to get the job done. but still i imagine even a resy would be smart enough not to cut a truss. thats a big no no in any situation.

TL;DR if you work construction and you're not smart enough to look before you cut you deserve to be fired/fined for your mistake I think the guy that run the wires should be in question... if you're a good electrician or phone/data guy you wouldn't run your stuff in a spot that would be possibly tampered with later; high and out of the way, or low and to the side; and considering the size of that bundle he should have provided a channel or wire way instead of using parts of the structure that may not be cut but could later be used as a fastening point...

He ended up taking his own life and was cremated. My 3 other brothers and I built a small ship and put some of his ashes on it. We went a few miles out into the Gulf of Mexico and soaked it with gas and shot fireworks at it. It was a very emotional experience. That was as close as we could get to a Viking funeral for him. In case anyone is confused, this is just the costume that he wore on stage. This happened at the 5th annual GWAR-BQ.   
All hail oderusI went to a GWAR concert when I was pregnant w/ my 1st child. There was no more room upstairs and they had stopped people from going up.  The only option was the pit, which I knew I couldn't do b/c of being pregnant. GWAR saw me and talked to the bouncers/management.  They brought me a stool which I sat on mid center in front of the stage w/ 3 bouncers surrounding me.  Was a great night, and I kept the t-shirt (that started out white) for many years afterwards.When GWAR came to my home town, they accidentally set the ceiling of the venue on fire with the fire dancing routine. Nobody in town would ever book them again, so the only time I ever got to see them was when they came through a city 3 hours away. I had to drive over a mountain pass in a shitty '92 Honda civic without snow tires in November to see them. Saw a car flipped over by the side of the snowy road, but good god, that was and will forever be the most amazing rock show I have ever seen.That's fucking metal.Guys, guys. He just went to hell because he needed a vacation.

It really sucks that Brockie succumbed to his demon, and metal lost an absolute icon. With that said, seeing this sendoff of his after ego was an awesome sight.See you in Valhalla.[deleted]GWAR gave me most popular joke throughout middle school; ""how do you hide money from a hippy? Put it under the soap!"" That shit killed in 7th grade.well, im making a new adjustment to my will.Yeah it was his costume and everyone chanted ""Oderus"" while an person dressed as an angel shot the arrows at his boat.  Then they started chanting Brockie afterwards.  It was amazing.When my old man died, my first instinct was to do something similar for him.

Bon fire him. But apparently it's not legal.

What I did do, was on the day he was cremated I went to the funeral home, and they let me help them load him up and push the button.

I said my good bye there next to the big machine that was turning him into ash.

The funeral was pretty easy after that.

Until they played Taps and the 21 gun salute, then I may have lost it a bit.

But yeah, it wasn't a viking funeral... but it was the closest I could get. 

That's not Oderus. He said ""Fuck Earth"" and went back to his home planet of Scumdoggia, where he will reign for another 43 billion years. We were lucky to have been soaked in his blood and GWAR juice. Peasants.

James Delorey was a 7 year old boy with autism who could not speak. He and his dog Chance wandered away from his house into the woods in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia in December 2009. A snowstorm hit and after several days the dog returned to the house and led searchers to the boy, who was barely alive. James was flown to hospital but succumbed to hypothermia and exposure. The searchers found a depression in the snow next to the boy's body where the dog had huddled with him for days to keep him warm.

[This was the cartoon](https://thegardenshutterbug.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/brucex092.jpg)  that MacKinnon drew following James' death.""Easy does it there lad, you're with us now.""

EDIT: We will remember them. MacKinnon is known for this wonderful stuff. If anyone can find the images he made for [September 12th](http://www.artizans.com/images/previews/MAC443.pvw.jpg), [13th](http://www.artizans.com/images/previews/MAC444.pvw.jpg), and [14th](http://www.artizans.com/images/previews/MAC445.pvw.jpg) 2001, you'll see. 

Not the best links but they do the job. 

EDIT: added linksThis cartoon is by Bruce MacKinnon, one of the best editorial cartoonists in the world.From Wikipedia: 

""In 2000, the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was added to the memorial site and symbolizes the sacrifice made by every Canadian who has died or may yet die for their country.""

So tragic.As a Canadian (NS), I just want to say thank you to our American and other international friends for their sentiments. Feels good to know the rest of the world shares our pain. Now excuse me, this editorial has made my eyes leak.Wow. This is the perfect way to show respect. He joins the brave men and women fighting back against the darkness so that we don't have to. 

Don't forget him.

Rest in peace Mr. Cirillo. ""With glowing hearts we see thee rise""Bruce MacKinnon always does an incredible job, but what really gets me is his ability to transition from satirizing bumbling politicians to making a heartfelt dedication to a fallen hero like it's nothing.There's a lot of important symbolism in this cartoon and the monument that it represents. WWI and a number of key events such as the [Battle of Vimy Ridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimy_Ridge) are viewed by many historians as seminal moments in defining Canadian nationhood. These doughboys are not just the predecessors of Cpl. Cirillo, their deaths helped give Canada a nascent sense of national identity a century ago.

I am not Canadian, but my condolences and gratitude go out to Canada (particularly Cpl. Cirillo's family) as an American serviceman. These kind of attacks are madness, and I hope we'll get the chance to do something to put a stop to them.I'll never understand how terrorists think acts like this will *discourage* us.  If anything, it polarizes popular opinion against them. This is really heavy and intensely sad, but a beautiful image.Can someone explain this cartoon? I don't fully understand what is happening.When cartoon artists get it right, they get it *fucking right*. This is one of the all-time greats, hats off to both artist and soldier.This broke my heart. Seeing all of those pictures with him taking pictures with people, pictures of his pets, it all just makes me cry. I'm from/live in halifax and the artist, Bruce MacKinnon, is amazing. I suggest everyone look into his books/comics.. Very powerful.""Come on up brother...""At first, I looked at the cartoon, and saw the men on the statue coming down to aid the fallen soldier. I was like, wow, that's amazing.

Then, the longer I looked at it, I realized they were *lifting him up* to join them on the memorial. **Bam, right in the feels.** I admit it, I cried like a child that lost their beloved pet. . .You stay classy Canada.The injustice is that it's almost never the people responsible for the conflict who face each other, it's everyone else. People like you and me, trying to get by while being content and comfortable, minding our own business until we become another *accidental victim*. No one is innocent, but only a few are willing to see the world burn for their petty ideals and madness, while the rest of us weep for the lost friends, families and good men & women who didn't ask for any of this.

[Here's a picture of him](http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/290/incoming/article21238323.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/cirillo.jpg).The soldier's name was Nathan Cirillo. He was 24 years old and a reservist in the Royal Canadian Armed Forces. His rank was Corporal. 

His family, friends and the whole world has lost a good human being to the depraved act of a mislead individual. 

This was a tragedy and no one is more entitled to being remembered than the man who was taken away from us. If you have to remember one thing about today, don't let it be the fear that the citizens of Ottawa felt or the panic of those who witnessed the attack, let it be a memory of those who stood guard to protect everyone on this day, a day of mourning, and the man who was taken, Nathan Cirillo.

Im curious.

In this case, the man was shot correct?  Does mouth to mouth actually accomplish anything if his death is from blood loss or trauma?  Always look for the helpers.Our thoughts are with our northern Brothers and Sisters. Man this is so heartbreaking. Sending love from England, fellow commonwealth brothers and sisters.[deleted]I am so sad. I left work sick this morning, and in the cab on the way home, the cab driver and I were listenning to the events unfold. Silently. Just listenning. It had *just* happened. It was still happening. I guess it's *still* happening... everyone is on lockdown now, even my coworkers. We just found out the soldier who was shot died, and there's talk that there may have been more shots fired at the Rideau Center. I've lived in this city for all 25 years of my existence. I love my beautiful, lame, quiet city. I am so sad that she's hurting today. I'm afraid for what's next... I'm afraid of the clashing of everyone's grief... the anger, the blaming, the sadness, the extreme measures that will be taken to prevent something like this again... It's going to change us. I know nations around the world experience this, and much worse, every single day. My heart goes out to those nations and the people. I don't know where you find your strength, but I hope we in Ottawa figure it out soon, we're going to need it. This photo leaves me speechless...It just hurts to look at. Makes me want to cry. I hope this woman knows what she did is very courageous...I'm sure most people at the sound of a gunshot scattered. This woman found the victim, although unsuccessful, tried to resuscitate our soldier. RIP Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, and thank you for serving our country.What makes this even worse is where it happened.

Canadian Forces member here;  just wanted to say that I'm touched by the flood of support and overwhelmingly positive and respectful things being said on this thread.  Reddit, you guys truly impress me sometimes. 

EDIT: Completely forgot my original thought, which was just that this has got to be one of the most powerful photographs in regards to its impact on Canada in many many years.This really baffles and angers the fuck out of me. I'm a former US soldier and I did joint maneuvers with our northern brethren years ago. The ones I worked with saved my ass when we were all out in the desert at NTC in FT. Irwin, California. They were the ones who realized I was severely dehydrated and got me to the medic tent after spending too much time in the sun in the motorpool. I should've been more aware of how I was feeling but these guys noticed. They were the coolest bunch of soldiers/people I ever met. They are known for being the nicest people in the world. I don't know why, even the extremists, would want to do this to Canadians. I wish I remembered the names of the maple leafs that helped me or even which unit they were with. In any case fuck whoever did this and thinks it was justified in any way. Fuck them in their stupid asses. I would line up next to our Canadian brothers any day for any fight. My thoughts are with all of them right now.. Sorry if too emotional, been drinking a lil bit. Love you maple leafs!! RIP, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo.  A goddamn shame.Fuck the assholes who did this shit. Who the fuck shoots someone at a memorial?

Edit: Please stop saying muslims did this. It's unconfirmed and prejudice to immediately assume it was them.
Edit 2: okay ""prejudice"" and I see now that it is confirmed to be a converted muslim, but of the many people responding with ""muslim"" I'm sure many didn't know that and are just making that leap.This is so fucking sad.From the sound of the [initial report](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29724907), he was shot in the chest (at close range, with a rifle of some sort). I hope he's ok.

The man's name is Nathan Cirillo. RIP you brave man. The soldiers name is Nathan Cirillo he lives in Hamilton with this grandmother and his little son (5). I am not to close with the guy but my roommate use to date him and we are all just shocked because we got news of what happened and as much as we haven't seen him around lately he use to a great guy and great person to go out with and have a good time. Cant believe I am even writing this doesn't not seem real. This kind of things don't happen in Canada and i hope we don't see more of it.I'm just so gutted about this. He didn't stand a chance. I hope my fellow Canadians stand strong and that we don't have a knee-jerk reaction which is so easy to do when stuff like this happens.

The shadows on the Moon are a dead giveaway as they don't match the way the shadow falls on the earth (the Earth shows the sun being overhead from this perspective, while the lunar shadows show the sun being off to the left. 

You could take a picture that did look like this, with the Earth low on the  horizon, however you would have to be on the moon near the near-side/far-side dividing line. (if you're in the middle of the near-side, near the equator, the earth would be directly overhead). Apollo missions all [landed at relatively equatorial lattitudes,](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRm0qKA0wJnL4DZwxL97FQHoYMl_tV1X_OlCk864imWh_LJgI7vcA) and none were close enough to the near-side/far-side line to take this photo.

Apollo 17 was closest to that dividing line,[ and here's an actual photo from the Apollo 17 mission.](http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/5779/a17v1430422as1713720910.jpg) [deleted]Digging around nasa.gov I found this image.  Bonus asteroid surface!

Except here we're still stuck in that news montage. It's eerie.They went full hazmat suit evac with a guy here today at the Birmingham (AL) Airport. He was vomiting and said he felt warm and had a headache. 

The flight was a United Express flight inbound from Chicago O'Hare. 

The man told the FA's he got motion sickness easily. 

Anyways, they went full hazmat/bio to pull him out, got off the plane and talked to him about where he's been. Arrived on an Int'l flight but not from Africa. 

His symptoms went away when he got off the plane (surprise!) and they let him go, called it a false alarm and didn't even take him for testing. 

It's getting insane. 

EDIT: Since a lot of people are asking, the other pax were forced to sit on the plane for 2-2.5hrs while officials had conference calls and meetings on how to deal with them. In the end, they just straight up released them. The temp was in the low 90s yesterday.I like how the hazmats in the joke ebola airplane incident were full body sealed off with a gas mask, and this guy is wearing goggles and a disposable mask.""2319...2319""I have a headache but I'm pretty sure that's from chugging a redbull and eating 2 zingers.Whoever took that picture should probably stay home on Reddit until death.Our irrational fear is going to get more people killed.

HIV has been in the states for decades and people still dont wear condoms.Is he from Africa ""SHEIIIIIIIT""Really? A headache? Geez, better quarantine me because I've got one right now! Yes this seems a bit extreme, but if/when there's an outbreak here, people would have gone mental if the government didn't take precautions like this, even if they're pretty extreme. Lose - lose situation for the officials really. This is really being blown out of proportion now... Seems like anything is being branded as Ebola now. Thanks media![deleted]So are black people going to be profiled now? If they really think that this guy has Ebola,  wouldn't it make more sense to ground that whole place an d quarantine every passenger? 

That's the same stupid logic as when the tsa removes your potentially explosive 2l water bottle an throws them into normal litter box where other potential explosive bottles of other travellers already wait to go off. You know what worries me the most about this? Here in the U.S. a lot of people will ignore symptoms of an illness and just muddle through because they can't afford a doctor.

... maybe this whole thing will make the public finally take public healthcare seriously. ""Oh shit, someone else's lack of basic healthcare might affect me? SOCIALIZE ALL THE MEDICARE IMMEDIATELY!""is there a news story around about this yet?Where was the plane coming from?http://i.imgur.com/hjCOjvt.gifIt could be helpful to ask a few questions, such as:
""What if the person is unable to self diagnose that he has Ebola?"" Or
""What if the person is reluctant to tell the airline that they have Ebola?""

Is it within the realm of possibility that these situations arise?

If you were seriously trying to stop the spread of a virus, would you treat every case seriously or would you hope for good fortune for some of the cases?The issue is, why are they having such exaggerated responses? It makes no sense for them to come in full hazmat suits unless they quarantine all the other passengers as well.

So they come on the plane, looking real scary, getting everyone worked up and plenty of film for the news outlets. But this response is essentially useless if they don't quarantine everyone else on the plane. 

So what if they test this man and he shows up as having Ebola? Now you have a whole plane full of possible vectors out there walking around. If they aren't concerned enough to be worried about the rest of the plane getting infected, why are they so worried to require such fully geared responses?

That tube in the tank is a clear waterslide that takes you through the shark tank.Any aquarium is a pool if you're brave enough.When I go to an aquarium, I know that if the tank breaks the sharks have no chance vs me on land. 

Thers's no way I'm getting into a pool of water right alongside a shark tank. No thank you.This place is begging to be featured in a new Sharknado movie. Golden Nugget casino in Vegas is what it looks like. a water slide goes through the tank.
Vegas?aka the nope zoneIs it bad that I remember this from a CSI episode?I believe that is called a ""feeding trough""Has anyone made a ""swim with the fishes joke yet? No? Well, I call it.

*ahem*

These guys must have messed with the wrong people because they're really *swimming with the fishes* now!The concept is really cool but I would constantly have my butthole clenched because all I would be able to think about is the glass breaking and letting the sharks in. The glass would cut my leg or arm and get my blood in the water and even though I'm a good swimmer I would be pulled under and eaten by said shark.

It could happen.Why not just call it poolquarium?Discovery World in Florida has the same thing but you are swimming with the fish and stingrays. In case you were having problems imagining a shark in the pool before.Wow a place on the /r/pics sub that I've actually been too?!! Tis, the golden nugget in Vegas. It has a water slide going through the shark tank. My family had rented out a cabana there. We hung out for the day, was great fun. When going down the slide you can't see much from inside the aquarium. Still fun though :). There is also a lounge on the top floor for I believe 14 and up? Lord knows why its 14 and not 18.

Bonus story: A fight broke out on the stairs leading up to the slide. It was a group fight between a group of Mexicans and a group of Italians (like straight up out of mob Italians.) Security came and broke it up, then hunted down the people that fled the scene. I didn't get to see it myself, but one of my family members did. Her poor 5 year old son almost got trampled :/. That looks like a cramped aquarium but then I'm not a fan of them to begin with. I'd prefer it if it was looking out onto an artificial reef on a shoreline, tanks have always seemed cruel however artistic or picturesque they appear.I stayed here about three weeks ago! But the water slide was closed :( Golden nugget casino and hotel in Vegas. The tube in the middle is a glass slide.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Nugget_Las_VegasThis is in Vegas.

My friend busted his ass in the shark slide.

It's a pretty...pretttty good pool.Damn it. Going to Vegas next week but not staying here.I was here in August, it's at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. There is a slide that travels directly through the tank too!Reminds me a bit, somehow, of the [Cave Bath in Hungary](https://www.google.com/search?q=cave+bath+miskolc&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=680&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=_SVaVIjPMMjAOYTzgaAP&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg).  Which is a pool system made out of hot springs in a cave, cause why the hell not.

I guess it's the idea of taking two different experiences and putting them together, and the narrowness of the pool.This is just asking for Deep Blue Sea to happen. Sharks would rampage for minutes before the chlorinated water killed them! MINUTES!!!Is this at the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas? 

It looks very similar, especially with the slide running through the tank.

EDIT: Scheduled to open to the public in June 2015!I went there last summer. It's pretty cool. But there is a ton of construction around it. Looked like they were building at least 10 new apartment buildings. Unbelievable how valuable that real estate got after this was completed. The architecture is pretty amazing though. I loved how a couple buildings were even built on top of the path. 

[Here are some pictures I took.](http://imgur.com/a/CY4v7) I want my city to have something like this so badly. 

*edit* As a pedestrian / multi use path.  Any sort of thing to get A to B in the city by walking and having a buffered area to walk.  It would make the economy of the local businesses surrounding it BLOW UP.Memphis did something similar recently. We turned an un-used railroad track that ran through the entire city into the ""green line."" It's a running/biking trail that takes you from through all parts of the city.I've been there and it's very pretty.  Sort of refreshing after walking through the city for a while.

Interesting fact.  Some of these railways were intentionally built low so that the city transportation, such as buses, couldn't reach certain areas.  This was because the designer of said bridges was an elitist and did want those who could not afford there own transportation to have access to the wealthier parts of town.  There's a beergarden directly under the park called ""The Biergarten"".If all those people are having to walk down that long path, surely it would be a good idea to perhaps install some sort of device for moving them quickly and charging for it.   
Perhaps a railway of some sort?What the heck is up with LSD Candyland in the lower left corner?A good documentary on the High Line aired recently. [It's on YouTube now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CgTlg_L_Sw)Should Vancouver do this?I walked on this when I went to NYC, and it's pretty amazing. I can not wait for Philadelphia to start fixing up their Reading Railroad Viaduct. Every city should do thisAtlanta's Beltline is this but even more massive. A 22 mile loop around the core of the city that connects neighborhoods and many of the cities major parks (and building new parks). It is also going to run a light rail line. Pretty cool stuff. https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Ujx7sb3iTlsMGeQD3p8_amhcEMGnbh_keO_l6cYaMyJUGWL8zoo2HmbkVFTZ9mbEzJbzhsLpXZS3zgkQNpu3xv6i_-aZgGDpvPQHNBCedRxNjap8wnmadpqEOlbhRXB5wluTFiL1bk0TpURPrJ2jD2Cayvgtz0X41AExuz3wm3RPdpHSenrc1wQID7fBYY410Prf4CHE_8b2=w607-h431-nc

http://beltline.orgSome of us don't consider abandoned railroads a ""blight"", although we'd much rather see them used by trains again that's not a park. that's a walkway with bushes.What where is this? I have never seen it or heard of it before.They did the same in Paris! http://www.promenade-plantee.org/ (in French)You can travel on it via google maps too : http://goo.gl/maps/EH2t3Dude that is nice. Looks like the beginnings of one of those Utopian illustrations with rooftop gardens and glass encased walkways. Atlanta did something like this, it's called the beltline. They evicted everyone who couldn't pay their rent after they raised it and now they demolished the houses and are building condos/townhouses! Hooray!To me this looks like Phase 1 of Midgar.

A couple of decades from now they'll figure out they can install a big suspended plate and on it they'll build a new city on a new level, that's even more exclusive and expensive.  It will make the city below it a cesspool of crime, poverty and deviant behavior (possibly involving cross-dressing or droid/drone cosplays).  Next they'll discover a new mineral called ""materia"" that can harness the power of the elements, among other things.  It's just a couple of buster swords and chain-gun prosthetic arms before a huge comet come barreling towards earth, threatening all life as we know it.



Nice little walk though, I'd recommend it if you're in NYC. All these thees and shrubs and not a single god damn fruit tree. This is so sad. Plant some fruit trees so people can eat off them. This is what I miss about Bangladesh. Fruit trees everywhere. It is amazing to walk along!Just did this yesterday. It was awesome.Tell me more about the Dr Seussical building.  What's that all about?

Married Children was alright. Much better than the shit we have on TV nowadays like Arrested Development, The Office, Archer, Parks & Rec, Bill Nye the Science Guy or Cosmos. Awful shows with just a douchebag following.

Grandpappy B.

Grandma B

Grand Marshall B

Bed Wetter B 

Court Jester B 

Gas Passer B 

Dustbuster B 

Cross dresser B

Butt wagger B

Thighmaster B

Grasshopper B.

It's a lonely life for Grandmaster B, yes, a lonely life for Grandmaster B.

Is it me or do they all look REALLY good? Can we get a Married with Children movie? WOOOOOOAAAH BUNDY!!!! 

(big ups to Futurama, Legend of Korra, Modern Family, and Applegate's big time movie career)Where the beer gives you gas, and the Bundys kick ass....Katey Sagal's still got it going on.Fun fact, both Ed's star and Katey's are right next to a shoe store.While I was working on Ghost Whisperer a few years back Katey Sagal was a guest star, and she was seriously one of the nicest and funniest people I've ever met/worked for/with. She's mega hot even without the makeup. Katey, Christina, and Ed have all done pretty well since then.

On a related note, I'm glad Burger King gave David Faustino the day off!Glad to see Faustino stopped texting long enough to take a photo.I used to be so confused when Al didn't wana bang her. Then I got older and realized that even the hot women have men that are sick of their shitGemma Teller is the worst. Not Katey, just the character. Can't stand her. In my retcon, Al and Peggy get divorced and Al marries an immigrant MILF.  Meanwhile Bud comes out as gay and eventually finds a long term partner. And Kelly gets her act together then settles down with some nebbish.  Meanwhile, Peggy moves away and hooks up with this biker dude and gets involved in some heavy shit and the family only hears from her sporadically.Who sleeps with his gun but loves his son? Psycho Dad!
Who shot his wife 'cause she weighed a ton? Psycho Dad!Holy shit is that Bed Wetter B? Has he had any new albums lately?Bud looks like he got stung by a bee in both his eyesHoly shit, why does Bud Bundy look 40?

Oh wait, I'm old.I think they should open up Modern Family with a Dream sequence by Jay that is a short Married with Children scene.  Just that spot before the credits would work perfectly.  Or maybe have them cameo in and have a running joke of ""You look familiar...."" and have the show end with a short dream sequence.

However, since one is fox and the other is ABC - I doubt they could pull this off.I went to Lollapalooza in 2008, and the first day of the show we asked a stranger how to get to the venue, Grant Park, in Chicago as we were tourists and didn't know where it was. He actually told us he was walking close and when he turned to go to work to leave us, we just went over a bridge and we would see it. Sure enough we walked over the bridge, and there it is... The water fountain from the intro to Married with Children, i didn't even know the show was based in chicago, but i laughed so hard cause i spent so many hours enjoying that show. Needless to say when we were choosing our safe spot incase someone got lost, it was that fountain.Damn! They all look really good.

Did you overtighten them? If you tighten too much the 'toggle' can dig into the drywall from the back, weakening it.

Northfield is a great little town too. I remember when I went there for college visits the whole town smelled like chocolate chip cookies because of a factory there.Quick story about Northfield.  
I went on a cross-country trip with about 20 like-minded folks to North Dakota (from NYC), where we spent a week shooting some short film footage for my friend's reel (aspiring film director).  Most folks headed back to NYC promptly, but I kept going west with my friend Joe and his brother - plan was to drop Joe off in Oregon and then his brother and I drive back towards the east coast, picking up my friend Gil in Northfield Mn along the way back.

Joe's brother decided to stay in Oregon, so I slowly made my way back across the northern west coast driving solo.  I was nearly delirious by the time I got to Minnesota.  

I found my way to Northfield, and drove up and down the main strip of town a couple of times looking for a pay phone to call Gil (this is before mobile phones were widely available).  After not seeing a pay phone anywhere, I parked up on the main strip and walked into a coffee shop to inquire about where I could find a phone.  Walked in, waited in line behind a couple of people, and when my turn came up, I asked the guy behind the coffee bar ""Do you have a pay phone I can use?""  

He looked at me kind of strangely, and said ""*PAY* phone?  There's a phone right there you can use"" and pointed to a phone sitting on a shelf right at the end of the coffee bar, and just as I start to come to the realization that this tiny town was not going to charge me to make a phone call, he follows up with ""Wait... you are [insert my name], aren't you!?!""  which really caught my attention - and was immediately followed by him shouting out ""Gil - [insert my name] is here!"", and 5 people jumped up from a sofa on the other end of the shop and screamed out my name in elation (only one of them being Gil, and Gil was the only person in the entire town I had ever met). 

Northfield, Minnesota is an amazing place.  I went to St Olaf, and Friday Flowers are a weekly tradition. A local flower shop sets up near the mailroom, and students can buy flowers for their friends and leave them in their mailboxes, which aren't locked. A nice tradition, glad to see it's still happening.
There's also a structure with wind chimes on campus, one chime for each student who died while at St. Olaf. Sad to hear another chime will be going up.St. Olaf? Have you ever met Rose Nylund?That's Minnesota nice for you. St. Olaf Alum.  They installed the first (or second?) stop light in Northfield while I was there.  The two colleges kinda sorta hated/ignored each other when I was there.  A class act, Carleton folk.St Olaf alumnus here. Last year several Carleton students died in a car accident and the St. Olaf students all sent flowers across campus. Incredibly generous of Carleton students to reciprocate the gesture. For context, not a single student died on either campus while I was a student. Brings tears to my eyes.As someone that attended St. Olaf not too long ago, I'd expect nothing less from either college. They may be rivals, but when it comes down to it, they are there for each other when it counts. This makes me extremely proud to call myself an alumni of Olaf.That is neat, how are things in Northfield?That's very touching. I found this http://apps.carleton.edu/carletonian/?story_id=1194894&issue_id=1194882 so it seems it's not the first time one school has reached out to the other after a loss. Nice. So I know I'm pretty late to this, but as a current St. Olaf student, I just have to say thank you to any Carls reading right now. 
I know most people would assume that a girl you barely knew dying wouldn't affect you much at all, but I've hardly been able to put a smile on my face since she died. When she died, so did my joyful, peaceful perception of reality here at Olaf. You guys helped bring a little bit of color into my world again. Thank you so much, Anna the Carl, for the beautiful note and flower. Cows, colleges, contentment! Makes me proud to be an alumni of Carleton today.then another one dies because of allergies, the rivalries are pretty tough in your college town. 

Edit: spelling. 
Changed touch to tough. Thanks for the post, OP. I'm one of the students who delivered the flowers to St. Olaf yesterday. I'll never forget last Winter after three Carleton juniors died in a tragic car accident, when students from St. Olaf put a flower and a handwritten note in every Carleton student's mailbox. It was a breathtaking display of solidarity. The circumstances under which we have returned the favor are tragic, and my biggest hope is for Oles to know that we Carls really do love and appreciate them.My dad went to St Olaf in the 70s. He and his roommate turned their room in to a skating rink by flooding the floor and leaving the windows open in the middle of arctic Minnesota winter.I went to college at a school with 50,000+ undergraduates. Our college's main rival has 40,000+ undergraduates...if this were to happen, we would make some florist a damn millionaire. Proud St. Olaf alum checking in!

That's why they do things like this, because nobody did it for them.

edit: Alright, more than a few people are mad because I didn't address this well enough.

First of all, NFL players are literally required to do a public event once per year, ""helping out their community."" Andre Johnson has already done several charity events throughout the year, having already given away tens of thousands of dollars. That addresses him not ""spending enough,"" and ""doing this just for publicity.""

Secondly, Andre Johnson is a 10+ year veteran #1 wide receiver on a team in the most popular sport in America. He has cameras following him *everywhere* and they will make a story out of anything he does or says. He can't tell them to fuck off, because then they will spin it about how he is ""the Grinch that bought Christmas,"" or something stupid like that. He basically has to pose for this picture, because if he doesn't, he'll look like a dick to millions of people, despite donating $16,000 to children at risk.

Thirdly, somebody honestly implied that Andre arranged this picture. You dumb fuck, do you think Andre Johnson is the only person in the world with a camera? Everybody has a camera these days, there's one on your phone.

edit 2: /u/Petus_713 [linked a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGE619qZ6n0) of the shopping spree from a first person perspective with a little interview of Dre at the end, such a humble man. To everyone criticizing Andre:  Way to be cynical.  I love the mentality that people who earn their money need to give it all away. He just gave a whole bunch of kids toys they probably never would of had if not for him. Yeah, he gets paid in the millions, but if you look at the market he is in, he is paid fair and no matter how you slice it, 16k is still 16k.

Also, why is there a stigma on standing behind a charitable act. That's how a lot of trends start, which creates more charity (who knows, maybe megatron or Larry decide to match or beat Andre's receipt in their town).  In my opinion, I think it's great he is making this public. NFL players are role models to kids all throughout America and this sure does paint a better picture than posting pictures of a $16k watch or a garage with several $100k cars inside. We always want to know when these guys do something wrong, but here is a guy taking time out of his day to help kids and we want to plaster him as someone with ulterior motives that are undeniably behind most if not all acts of charity, anonymous or not. 

Way to go Dre, keep it up.Some of you people are fucking morons. ""He's only spending point one six percent of his income, psh what a fucking asshole"", Jesus fucking Christ, the same people who will upvote any fucking picture of Bill Nye just for existing are critical of a dude just trying to give back. It's pretty simple, his intention was to give a few kids a once in a lifetime experience where they get to hang out with a professional athlete and walk around a toy store and buy whatever they want. You don't need to bring politics, economics, or race into it, it was simply a good guy doing a good thing, stop being critical and having to make edgy snide remarks on the Internet to prove how much better you are than a dude who dropped $16k on some kids who probably haven't gotten shit in their life. WAY cooler than the ""look how much money I spent at the bar"" pics.Love to see this.  We always hear about the bad things NFL players do but rarely the good things.

Edit: wordsHes got the longest receipt ever and the guard is still eyeballing him!This is posted every year and I like to chip in to it. Im a houston child protective services worker. Our kids in care are flooded with christmas gifts each year. No kid is left for wanting. What he does is above and beyond. Each year we (caseworkers) submit a child from our caseload for this. These kids selected come from the most horrific evil backgrounds that no you cannot imagine what they went through. He picks them to get an extra special shopping adventure of their own. There is next to zero local publicity for this. A write up maybe so it so clearly is not done for tax or fame purposes. Man is a god. Edit: the kids are given a free run of a local toys r us for a set amount of time picking whatever they want. He doesnt just buy gifts and drop them off. A kid on my caseload was selected last yearSeems like Andre and JJ Watt take community service and trying to better their city to another level, texans certainly draft some quality human beings.If only he was this generous when getting me fantasy points this year.I wonder what percentage of their salary the people criticizing AJ for not giving enough donate?  I'm guessing right around 0%.ITT: armchair philanthropists.
""It's not that much for what he makes."" Fuck off. I'm going to miss Andre next year :( Yeah, I'm going to need to check that...

If only there was a way to change snide fucking comments into gift vouchers or something.The NFL should really start promoting their good guys like Andre Johnson who over the past 3 years dropped $16k, $17k, and $19k, on toys for underprivileged kids. It could really help their image issue.The sad thing is, because he came up in the 'Diva Era' of receivers, but never caused the drama or craved the camera, he got overshadowed by many of his peers who weren't nearly as good as he.  One of the best Receivers, and people to have ever played football.  Great job Andre!It's absurd how so many people are analyzing the shit out of a simple charitable donation.

The Fastest Guys Out There -- Written by Brian Schul
There were a lot of things we couldn’t do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.
It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.
I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn’t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: November Charlie 175, I’m showing you at ninety knots on the ground. Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the “ HoustonCentervoice.” I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country’s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houstoncontrollers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that… and that they basically did. And it didn’t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.
Just moments after the Cessna’s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his groundspeed. Twin Beach, I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed. Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check Before Center could reply, I’m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol’ Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He’s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground. And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done – in mere seconds we’ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground. I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: Ah, Center, much thanks, We’re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money. For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the HoustonCentervoice, when L.A.came back with: Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.
It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day’s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.[deleted]that yellow one is so cute!All I see is Starscream and the X-Jet.","{'Sadness': 0.058841, 'Emotional_Range': 0.771, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.248, 'Fear': 0.376402, 'Analytical': 0.343, 'Conscientiousness': 0.169, 'Agreeableness': 0.735, 'Joy': 0.08642, 'Disgust': 0.051949, 'Extraversion': 0.684, 'Openness': 0.299, 'Anger': 0.759829}","{'animal': 0.310026, 'vehicle': 0.890903, 'airplane': 0.802184, 'bird': 0.377541}"

The future is bleak.Bahahaha  same thing almost happened at my wedding. Priest told my buddy to take the rings out of their boxes, and put them in his pocket. A few minutes after he was sweating profusely and started walking around looking under shit, and talking to people. 

He came up pale as a ghost and said ""Man I don't know how to say this but there was a hole in my pocket and I lost the rings""
I burst out laughing, because my wife and I joked about him losing his mind if he ever lost them. 

I slapped his pocket and felt them in the lining ""nah man, you have'em"" followed by more laughter, and the colour returning to his face. 

lol poor guy, he must've felt like such an asshole for ten minutes.

edit:AI just got married in may. The very next day I was taking a shower in the hotel and was using a wash cloth. The ring slipped right off and into the shower drain. It was such a horrible feeling. Maintenance looked in the trap for like 2 mins and said well its gone. So I went to the front desk and asked what we could do. They said they had a plumber coming to do some other work in the hotel so they would take a look the next day and turned the water off to the room. This was all in the morning and we had to catch a flight for our honeymoon. Well we needed to file a report so we could claim insurance on the right through Jarad. We went to the police station and they refused to take a report because it wasn't ""lost"" because we knew it was in the drain. So I called Jarad and they basically told me they couldn't do anything without a report and since it was in a drain that wasn't covered. At this point I am just defeated and just feel like I literally threw money down the drain. Well a few days later on the honeymoon we got a call from the hotel that the plumber found the ring and we could pick it up when we got back. Its all kind of funny now but at the time it was the worst feeling in the world. TL;DR lost my ring the day after my wedding in the hotel room bathtub drain. Cops refused to take report, couldn't claim insurance on the ring. Hotel was awesome and a plumber snaked the drain and found my ring all while we left for our honeymoon. My son lost his One Ring when he was dressed as Bilbo for Halloween last year. He was absolutely devastated because it had come from his uncle (my brother in law) who had died just a couple of months before that. This picture reminds me of it because that's what we looked like in my friend's backyard all night that night. Poor kid, he still talks about it. Doesn't anybody own a metal detector anymore?Ive been a best man twice, protip: safety pin them to the inside of your pocket.You had one job! ONE[deleted]He was the ""best"" man.  Doesn't say much for the other guys thereIt'll be a tough crowd for the best man's speech. I'll bet the best man is that Zach Galifianakis looking guy on the left.I was almost that guy.  I was the best man and had both rings in my breast pocket.  I went to tie my shoe in the parking lot between ""pre-game shots"" of jager and they both slid right out onto the pavement.  I didn't even notice a thing, but luckily one of the other groomsmen saw them lying on the ground at my feet before we went inside.  I'll never forget the look on his face when he pointed them out to me.  I still get adrenaline rushes of shame when I think about it and it's been 8 years.I'm getting married next weekend. Thanks for the needless anxiety, reddit. Best Man? More like Worst Man.I've nearly been there as a best man.  The groom wanted me to produce the rings from the inside pocket of my jacket, even after I told him that the pocket was too small for my hand to fit and be able to reach the rings in it.  Being that it was his day I obliged.  It lead to me having to take off the jacket in the middle of the ceremony and flipping the pocket inside out to get to the rings.  It wouldn't be a wedding unless one thing went wrong.If I owned a place that hosted weddings I would seriously keep a metal detector.  This has got to happen at least a couple times a year for them.  Metal detector + found ring = huge tip.Same thing happened to my friend. Was playing football on the beach, popped right off into the sand. 15 of us walking carefully sifting our hands through the sand. We found it.Awe... I misread the title as, ""Best Man is NOT Lord of the Rings""Why's everyone checking their pockets? Did you go to a wedding that was only attended by kleptomaniacs and there was a very real chance that they were accidentally stolen by an attendee?Yeah now who's a fucking nerd for owning a metal detector. Yeah now I'm the fucking hero, fuck you Steve. I was the best man for my brother's wedding and I know how he feels.

My cousin was going to be the ring bearer, but since he was 4, we did not trust him to handle the actual rings and just had him walk down with a fake set.  I was to hold the bride's ring and the maid of honor was to hold my brother's ring, and some sleight of hand would get them to my brother and his wife-to-be before the rings were given.
10 minutes before the ceremony was going to start I took the ring out of the box I had been keeping it in and put it in the front right pocket of my jacket so the bulge from the box would not be overly obvious. I thought nothing of it until about 3 minutes out, right as everyone was leaving to go upstairs, when I checked the pocket out of force of habit.  The ring was gone.  Initiate full panic mode.

For those unaware (as I was at the time), most rental tuxedos have jacket pockets for decoration only and the bottom of the pockets themselves are not fully sewn together.  The tailor uses a sparse thread pattern to simply keep the sides of the pocket together and the ring had fallen, unbeknownst to me, straight through the holes between threads and now resided in the lining of my jacket. After frantically searching the floor immediately around me, and checking the box again to no avail, I was beginning to panic.  2 minutes, 15 seconds until the ceremony started and I had lost the ring.  I did so well for the entire day only to be remembered as the klutz best man that lost the ring, like some kind of cliche sitcom joke.  Maybe the goddess of luck heard my pleas, because by a stroke of what could only *be* luck I managed to brush against the ring in the corner of my jacket with my hand and in my panicked state actually had the wherewithal to recognize the size, feel, and weight.  I was swept with momentary relief as I realized I was not a complete klutz, only partly one.  But I could not simply give my jacket to my brother when I was to hand the ring off and a jacket ring would look silly anyway, would look completely hideous with that dress.  I now had to find some way to get the ring out without destroying the jacket (though the thought certainly crossed my mind) and only 2 minutes remained until the start of the ceremony.

After trying and failing to fish it out with my finger, I began to get frustrated and started to attempt to pull the sewing apart with my fingers. This was to no avail as my fingers alone were unable to get the leverage needed to rip the thread and create a wider opening to get my whole hand into.  90 seconds to go and panic is beginning to take over as I slowly look over to the case knife that is clipped to the lip of the pocket of my other pants hanging neatly over a chair in the corner of groomsmen's room.  Walking over, I resign myself to a hefty repair bill and unhinge the knife.  Where and how deep do I make the incision, doc?  70 seconds.

It was at that moment I was surprised by a hand on my shoulder and turned around to face my father who was a little shocked to find me standing there, knife in hand about to perform open seam surgery on a several hundred dollar jacket.  As I'm about to explain he holds up a severely disfigured coat hanger in his hand and starts to smile.  He had seen me panic just as he was leaving and having worn many suits and tuxes over his lifetime, had deduced what happened.  Also, me muttering things like, ""why the fuck do you have a pocket that's not sewn up, who does that?""  was probably a dead giveaway as well.  He had grabbed a coat hanger from the rack outside and squashed it down to a small enough size to be used as a fish hook of sorts to get this thing out.  One try and we had the ring close enough to the top of the hole to be able to reach in an extricate it from it's well tailored prison. 30 seconds to go.  

Clipping the ring onto a pen clip and then placing in my pants pocket, we dashed for the prep area and were able to make it there right as we were to walk out.  My brother was a little worried when we didn't follow the rest of the group up but we assured him that nothing was wrong.  Dad and I decided to wait a year or so to tell him what happened.He pulled a real Jerry. Did you check the base of the tree? That's where they usually end up.

It's awesome! Not such a big tourist attraction so it's usually a little more empty. Toward the end of his life he started turning his apartment into a museum for his work. The first floor is his living quarters preserved exactly as they were, and then the second two floors are ballroom-sized galleries hung floor to ceiling with his paintings in various stages of completion.

I wasn't familiar with the paintings before I visited, but Moreau's work is really amazing. Spans from HIGHLY detailed neoclassicism to impressionistic experiments in form and color that verge on abstract impressionism. He was obsessed with Byzantine, Indian, and other Eastern art, so his paintings have intense and highly detailed hieroglyphic patterns.

A few favorites that are in the museum:

 * [The Suitors](http://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/gustave-moreau/the-suitors.jpg)Good luck getting a couch up there OP.Those stairs remind me of an old story my Grandma used to tell me when I was a kid. A spiral staircase was mysteriously built in the Loretto Chapel in Sante Fe after the original builder of the chapel died leaving no steps going to the choir loft. The nuns there prayed and a shabby man showed up sometime later and completed the staircase with primitive tools and no nails. Three months later, he disappeared without ever taking payment. Legend is that it was St. Joseph the Carpenter come to complete the job. It may be a tall tale, but my Grandma loved those stories, and I love that she shared them with me.One drunk walk of shame and I would die./r/crazystairsIs it weird that I'm way more inclined to stare at the stairs than at the art?

Other life might have just as easily developed sensory organs to ""see"" another band of wavelengths as well. 

Without the  ability to perceive the fine differences in wavelength we call color, our worlds might look like any random set of colors to them, or maybe even appear to be in grayscale.

My grandfather was a jeweler, he felt very strongly about birthstones being more important than diamonds for jewelry.  He did Liberace's Piano ring, if you want to check it out.  There's a sweet photograph at the MOMA, if you're near the city.  I loved my grandfather dearly (as most do), and enjoyed sitting in his workshop while he was setting rings.  He would tell me all the bullshit about the diamond trade (I was seven at the time) and suggested that diamonds be left either to industrial or heritage stones.  I went the heritage route with my wife's wedding band; incorporating the diamonds from my grandmothers wedding band in a new setting.

Long story short (too late), I had an Art Deco style engagement ring made from a local jeweler, and it looked fantastic.  I work as an engineer by day, and this stone was easily an IF stone, with beautiful trichromic characteristics.  Just because it's not a diamond, don't sell it short.

I was watching a village through a camera that has both regular vision and thermals. I see a motorized tricycle pull up and there was instantly a large crowd around it. There was some big box on the back of it with glass on all 4 sides and a solar panel on top. 

I keep watching and the owner of the tricycle starts messing with the box. I clicked over to thermals and this box is really hot, now I'm really curious. 

I clicked back over to regular view and popcorn is coming out of the box.

No shit in Afghanistan there is a guy going village to village on his motor tricycle making popcorn for people on his solar powered popcorn machine. 

Still one of the coolest/strangest things I've ever seen.

#CCOOORRRRRAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLIt's funny.  I grew up on the same block as this house.  When I saw this picture the other day it reminded me of this house because they do a big thing almost every year (I remember almost 30 years ago when they just had two ghosts on their porch and would pull the string from inside which made one of the arms move when you knocked on the door; ;when you are 4 or 5 years old it was terrifying,  It's just gotten better every year they do it).  When I saw this picture yesterday I wasn't paying attention to the house next to it otherwise I would have immediately recognized it to be that very house.  Then today, I had my friend drive me by this house to check out what they were doing this year and I was like ""damn I just saw this a Reddit yesterday"".  The picture is just a portion of the setup they have.

My car shows mileage on a screen, so I'll never be able to get it reset to 0 and post it on reddit for karma.I drive too much.

I loved that thing. Had I not wrecked it, I'm sure it would have run forever. [deleted]Al Bundy got a free car from Chrysler when his odometer rolled over. 

Due to some unforseen hijynx, he did not receive the vehicle. 

Oh Al. Edit: Story is probably wrong. Seems it was just the air flow sensor (MAF).


I had one of those. The computer thingy, ECU, that does the fuel injection died on me. This means it won't run on idle, and I had to keep my foot on the throttle when clutching out to change gears, or when standing still. Which is kinda hard to do when you have to brake at the same time. 

Solution from a certified repair shop? Disconnect the whole thing. Worked fine for a year after that.
And the engine block hasn't cracked yet? Wow, you got a good one.Woohoo! New car!You took it for one run of 100K it has another lap or two left.My first car was a '92 Ford Escort hatchback.

Mexico gets a bad rap for the all the narco violence and it is a serious problem. But, Mexico's geography is some of the most beautiful the world has to offer.

Mexico lindo y querido I've been here, and it is absolutely gorgeous! The bugs are huge there though!My god Mexico is GORGEOUS.
 I was just there in February and went to Puerto Vallarta for my second time. Had some astonishing sights as we came down towards the airport, (Last time I went, it was a night flight) from the amazing mountain ranges that went for MILES, to the great strands of beaches all the way up the coast, with almost a rainforest look of palm trees just a couple hundred yards from the water, and in some places even closer!

Took an awesome city tour and went through many alleys and streets just laden with decorations and definitely had a cultural ""feel"" to the whole place. Went down to the Malacon and then up through the mountains to a beautiful tequila distillery where I had some of the greatest tequila I have ever tasted in my life. (Including something similar to Mescal, straight out of the still! AMAZING!!) Followed by an amazing lunch while being serenaded by a single Mariachi. 

To ANYONE considering a trip anywhere in mexico, definitely do it. And go for 10 days! You lose two days with flights so make sure you get at least a week of sun in! Cheers!love the green riverlets keep this goin, whatcha got canadaFuck. This reminds me of the pics I took in Sinaloa I lost on a hard drive.

Inland and parts of the Gulf are beautiful, it really is a wonderful country if you just ignore all the violence.

They say: I feel secure, people are friendly, drivers go safely at streets and the country is very beautiful. The visitors came from US, New Zealand and South Korea.

Of course there is unsafe places but it just like any other country also has.

**Leela**: Do you know what it means?

**Fry**: Yeah, I asked a cop once. It means “Up yours, Kid”.Ok, am I crazy, or is the 'simplified' version completely and totally wrong?  I'm going to pick out the two obvious pieces:
1. Most importantly, the arrows go different directions...meaning different zones.
2. The top sign specifically mentions school days.  Between holidays, and the summer, there's likely a significant amount of days not taken into consideration by the other sign.
All I can think about is LouieShouldn't 7am to 8am on sat be any not 1 hour?  Also the sign on the left has arrows pointing to the left and right of the sign indicating different areas. The one on the right does not.   But in general ... it's a good start.  She lost some detail though - the restriction is on school days not all Monday through Friday.Why no standing? More Information:

[NPR Story](http://www.npr.org/2014/10/30/360179397/a-well-designed-parking-sign-can-make-life-much-easier)

[The designer's web site](http://toparkornottopark.com/)

That's a nice idea but the traditional signage is still better. They just need to update their signs and use less confusing language. 

The problem with the one on the right is that you can't read it from your car easily, which is when you NEED to be able to read it. 

Im pretty sure the Left signs are NYC ones, not Los Angeles ones unless they use the same. Either way, the left ones are easier to read and more effective, what are you people having trouble with? 

Left of the sign, 1 hour parking between 8:30am and 7pm except on Sunday.
Left and right of the sign, no parking between 8 and 8:30 am. (Its for streetsweepers that clean the streets)
Right of the sign, you can't park from 7am to 4pm on school days. (For School buses)I thought they were going to say nice thingsThe ""simplified"" sign is clearly wrong. You can park to the left anytime between 8:30am and 7pm for 1 hour by feeding the meter. You cant park to the right any time or stand between 7am and 4pm on ""school days"", which are days when school is actually in session. You cant park at all between 8 and 8:30am except sundays.The parking system is designed to make you fail. The city wants to write as many parking tickets as possible. They have officers waiting for you to park in the wrong spot all dayThis needs to be done in NYI've lived in both NYC and LA, and the sign in this photo (on the left) is definitely NYC. Nobody on the West Coast would even understand what the phrase ""No Standing"" means.Except the sign on the left is from New York?That's not LA...I wonder what the feasibility of electronic signs is. Like, they change depending on the scenario/time/date. They would just tell you whether you can or can't park, if it's free or paid, and for how long.What if you are color blind? This doesn't work. Plus it's too small. The major problem with this is that its expensive and difficult to update the sign. The existing signs are modular you only need so many different signs and you mash them together as required to meet any situation. The new system can require a unique sign for every parking area.The sign on the left is different to the sign on the right.

The sign on the right could be largely simplified. Imo it's still not easier to read.

did the designer just start year-round schooling with no holidays in LA??

m-f does not equal school days

I like the parking signs because I actually understand them. Most people don't bother with even trying to comprehend them.

The ONLY problem I have is areas with permit parking that have red/green signs that say ""No Parking 6pm-8am"" in RED, ""1-Hour Parking from 8am-6pm"" in GREEN, then ""Parking Permit X Exempt"" in RED. This implies the permit excuses you from the RED text only, whereas it actually applies to the ENTIRE SIGN. Then the real problem is the street cleaning sign that is IMMEDIATELY above THAT sign in RED that is enforced separately from the permit sign.Yes the city will adopt this because less people will get confused and fined by the city-wait...fuck.IMO, the 1 hour portions should be a different color than the Any portions","{'Sadness': 0.092435, 'Emotional_Range': 0.632, 'Tentative': 0.107, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.858758, 'Analytical': 0.511, 'Conscientiousness': 0.215, 'Agreeableness': 0.321, 'Joy': 0.046385, 'Disgust': 0.089811, 'Extraversion': 0.414, 'Openness': 0.491, 'Anger': 0.911783}",{}

Horseman, pass by!First thing I thought of was the edge of Motocross Madness. *BOOM*How I wish to one day visit something that beautiful. Almost takes my breath away just looking at the picture. I should go to Ireland. I have you tagged as ""fucking idiot.""Ireland is so amazing. Everything about it. First of all, it is crazy cheap, you can stay in a the top rated B&Bs for like $40. The food is cheap and amazing. The people there are so nice, like over the top, genuine kindness. I took a road trip through Ireland and was in constant awe. You literally are driving along and seeing such a variety of landscape. One hour it's fields and fields of green and these stone fences keeping in so many sheep! The next hour it's rocks upon rocks in the amazing Burren. Next, you are on the top of a cliff looking down at the roaring ocean as Puffins fly overhead. If you are more of a city person then there is Belfast and Dublin where you can do pretty much anything, including visiting one of the best zoos in the world and Guinness factory. In between all these gorgeous places is an amazing history. My favorite was Newgrange, which dates to c.3, 200BC. It's mysterious and spectacular. You can stand there in front of that passage tomb and look out at unopened ones right in front of you, knowing that they are full of unknown treasures and mysteries...just waiting to be opened. There are castles galore and just amazing culture everywhere. Another great thing about Ireland is that it is so small. You can literally drive length wise across the whole country in 8 hours. Amazing. Seriously, out of all of the places I have been, Ireland is the top.

EDIT: Just to help confirm my point that Ireland is wonderful. Here is a few pics I took there. http://imgur.com/a/BsnkLDon't be fooled, Its been cold and rainy here for the last 2 months. I can't remember what the sun looks likeI wonder what that distinct erosion looking line is from.

And what percentage of graduates become inmates?**what the text says:** 75% of inmates are dropouts  
**what the design says:** 75% of schoolkids will be convicted  

kind of misleadingAnyone else notice how the bus resembles a cigarette? Does this transport school kids or prisoners?So what have we learned from this, children? Finish high school then you are smart enough to not get caught by the law.Prison is mostly for blue collar crime.  With education you can move up to white collar crime where the chances of being caught are slim and the penalties even slimmer. But 9/10 seats are whiteBy my estimate the paint job on that bus covers 88% of available seats on the bus. A little misleading don't you think?Yea but what percentage of drop outs are inmates?  
All I take from that is criminals are less likely finish their education, not that dropping out makes you a criminal.  
1 out of 4 inmates have a high school diploma. Happy Fucking ThanksgivingOver 90% of prison inmates claim to be religious and believe in god.Its bad enough school feels like prison, now they're painting the busses like its a prison.

This probably doesn't help their cause I guess the real question we should be asking is.

why do kids drop out of school?I went to jail and I have a BS in Human Physiology! I showed them.I'm a high school dropout. Guess I know where I'm going. More than 99% of inmates ate apples before they were incarcerated.And ofcourse it's the backend of the bus where all the criminals sit.The picture does not really fit to the data.Wrong, but fine. Is it a high school bus or a prison bus?We need to be proactive about this issue.

High school dropouts need to be sent straight to prison. Let's see if we can get that 75% up to 100%!I wonder why they chose to paint the BACK of the bus...

Hitler's actual house (the Berghof) was farther down the hill, though all that remains of it is one retaining wall and a bit of foundation.  Hitler was acrophobic, and only visited the Kehlsteinhaus perhaps about a dozen times.

It's a cool pic, though!some of the most bad ass, bad asses that ever bad assed.Quite a picture !
There is always that one guy though, checking his email
Besides all the killing/dying those boys had a great time.  I've been up to Berchtesgaden and it's an amazing place. Went up the golden elevator and saw the damaged marble mantlepiece that was chipped off during the occupation.

If you are ever near Salzburg definitely worth a visit.I heard that one time Dick Winters Cold Cocked a guy with an Ice Dildo.

for those keep track at home, that's three chilly penis puns in one sentence.Who is who ?They did a great job of choosing actors that closely resemble those who they are portraying.. that still fascinates me to this day. Says something that when I first pulled up the picture I thought it was a cast photo from BoB.Bottom row, third from left.  Put down your goddamn cell phone.I had heard that they choose the actors based on physical likeness to the real person, and I can say they did a good job. I can probably pick our or atleast give a good guess of who most people in that picture are.I just decided to start watching this show last night. What's that law about things seeming to crop up more when you have vested an interest in them?It looks like the soldier in the beige shirt is wearing a German pistol holster. War trophy?When I was stationed in Germany in the Army, I got to go on a tour of the Bastogne battlefield with Guernier and Babe. Best weekend of my life. Was so much life in those two, were full of stories.They *really* did a fantastic casting job for the series.[deleted]I still maintain that Band of Brothers is the greatest program ever produced on television.

And of course, kill HitlerThe Eagle's Nest is one of the strangest places I've visited. It's beautiful, in every aspect but then you start to walk around the house and you look at the relics of a horrible dictatorship. Nothing has ever been so strange.I can't think of a movie miniseries thing I have enjoyed as much as Band of Brothers.  Absolutely brilliant to watch and incredibly well written and cast.

Proof: http://i.imgur.com/rYB4Feg.jpgI actually know some members of the family who own the building. They are all honestly some of the nicest people in Cold Lake, and it's disgusting the vandalism happened to their business. Way to go to the Cold Lakers who stepped up and showed some love to their fellow Canadians.I love how even the graffiti itself is moderately polite.Or in reverse this is a photo of hooligans preparing themselves to vandalize the local mosque.  I like to think that this is part of what makes Canada...well, not the US.

It's not the repainting, not the cleanup and support. Most of the Americans I know would do the same thing - and honestly, not all of the Canadians I know would do this. There is intolerance, racism, hatred, and prejudice EVERYWHERE, and we can't pretend that place 'x' or 'y' is free from it.

But the news about this? It's about the cleanup, and the support. The news about the shooting yesterday? It's mostly about Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and our resolve to stand together in the face of adversity; not about the lunatic with a gun, and our determination to hunt down his 'type', whatever that may be.

We look forward, together; we don't look backwards, and we don't point fingers at each other. We're not perfect, but most of the time, most of us try not to be as violent towards those who wrong us as they are to us.

And that alone is enough to make me proud to be Canadian.

^psst! ^redditors! ^^What ^^do ^^they ^^like ^^in ^^Cananda? ^^^Maple ^^^Syrup??The really messed up part about this is that if it happened in the States, you just might see the same reaction by some people in the community.

But you will never hear about it in the media because it's not deemed newsworthy.

Now if the same group of people burned down the mosque, you would definitely hear about it...even if it happened in a small shit town in the middle of nowhere.American here, lived in Canada for many years.

/r/misleadingthumbnails “It is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of the intoxicating existence we've been endowed with. But what's life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be , is every bit as strong as ours-arguably even stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don't. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment's additions existence.

For every sculpture, there was a small bronze or plastic model of the sculpture for blind people. The sculptures are generally huge, you know, abstract, much bigger than lifesize, with many built into the land in a way that you can walk through or into. Anyway, I was with my fiancée, and I said ""this is very cool,"" closing my eyes as I felt the model of the large triangular bridge sculpture I was about to walk through, ""but I would think that, when you're blind, visual art is pretty much one of the things that you must have to simply give up, and that's one of the many reasons it would suck so bad. Do blind people really want to go to a sculpture garden?"" She assured me that yes, they do. I was skeptical until we were just about to leave, and we saw a large group of teenagers, all carrying thin canes, being led by a guide who was loudly giving them a tour. They were all blind. ""Well fuck me,"" I thought, ""I have never been proven wrong so quickly and obviously."" How can we teach children to read if they can't even fit inside the building?!But are the dots to scale?That was my favorite part of any museum ever as a kid- the scale model of the museum.

Awesome book.Is it just me, or does it look like the city of Bruma in Cyrodiil? (The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion)I think the title is a bit misleading... It's not an actual map for orientation. It's just a sculpture of the inner part of the city (Münster) with some general information about it in braille. You can find other sculptures like this throughout the city. Source: I lived there for five years. 

Münster is definitely worth a visit, if you travel through Germany! http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MünsterHow the hell do they carry them?It's all fun and games till you put your hand in bird shit. So, if I'm lost, and blind, how do i use/find this map?""This office building feels nothing like it did on the map!""[Here are a few shots of the dimensional map in Edinburgh.](http://imgur.com/a/fHk2M)moving to Japan is a humbling experience for any North American to see how much disability is taken into account in urban planning. Literally everything has braille, most crosswalks (even in the countryside) have jingles that allow the blind to know when to cross (different patterns for when to cross which way), and coded, textured sidewalks to let the blind know where to walk, turn and stop.  
Honestly, as a Canadian I was embarrassed when I first came here of how far we are behind as a society compared to Japan when taking into consideration the disabled and the elderly. how do they find the map?We have one of these at York Minster. I always thought it was just for show.

I love it!I wonder how the timelapse will end up now that this is posted on Reddit..I passed this sign on a hike of the top of at Mt Diablo last Friday. For anyone in the Bay Area it's a great time to go. The wildflowers are everywhere and there are some that have not been seen in 50+ years because the fire has allowed for the right conditions for them to show up again. Also the clear days we've been getting make for killer views where you can see the GG bridge and Lake Tahoe Mountains.I interviewed one of the people behind this idea. The phone holder is worth $1.50 and can be found at most hardware stores.

Pretty ingenious idea and a great way to keep across ecosystem regrowth after fires. Check out the interview [here](https://soundcloud.com/1233newcastle/monitoring-fire-regrowth-with-smartphones) if you want. I saw this today too, all over Twitter.

""oh.. Yeah, 5k sounds fair.""Every time I read a description about an art form I always think- ""cool something for me to try""
I have to pretend I never saw this nowProfessional glass artist here. This is how it's made:

The artist will pull very long strands of glass in all the colors that required for the picture he wants to make. They then arrange the long strands of glass into say a face or a foot or something. then melt them all together and pull that very long again. Then you can take the face you made and add that 'face' strand to a whole bunch of other strands to make an overall picture.

tldr: it's just like using one pixel at a time to make up the whole image.[deleted]Yeah yeah yeah that's real neat and all but you can't even smoke weed out of it.  Fantastic stuff!

I'M SICK OF THESE MOTHERFUCKIN' PLANES ON THESE MOTHERFUCKIN' TRAINS!There's actually a pretty interesting fact about these fuselages. The fuselage (the body of the plane without any guts, wings, tail or anything) is manufactured at a plant in Kansas, Wichita if I'm not mistaken, then taken to the Boeing plant in Everett/Renton, Washington by train, where the planes are completed and flown out of.

The size of these fuselages is limited to a specific length(somewhere around 76.5m), not because they can't build planes bigger, but because there is a tunnel in Kansas that the train which transports these fuselage travels through and if the fuselage were any bigger than the maximum size, the train would get stuck in that tunnel.

>The formation of this strange landscape started during the third geological period, when three volcanoes located on the edges of this region began erupting frequently. The deposits of volcanoes ash, lava and basalt laid the foundations for today's landscape. Earthquakes and ongoing effects of erosion have contributed to form the valleys and the ""fairy chimneys"" that can be seen today.

>As the rock below the top layer of basalt is extremely soft, it can be easily carved. Communities took advantage of this to make their home in the rock pillars and under the ground. Today, these examples of homes, churches and whole cities abound in Cappadocia.

Billions of dollars have been spent to cure more familiar diseases like HIV and AIDS, but frankly it's hard for me personally to understand the impact of the research because I, or people around me, have never experienced those diseases (God forbid!). The fact that you were in Indonesia to contribute to the fight against Dengue Fever is very emotionally moving - success of this research would undoubtedly impact me, the people around me, and future generations of Indonesians! Again, thank you so much! You are such an awesome member of society.When can we install ""photonic fences"" around the world and zap mosquitos to death? Can we have one in hat form? I'd totally wear a laser hat that killed mosquitos.

And on a serious note, thank you for everything you and your wife are doing around the world.Inspiring stuff Bill! Hope you weren't too itchy.

Also, just listened to the radiolab about mosquitos. Maybe some other redditors would enjoy it:

edit: thanks for the gold, pingouins.Is there a video source for this?For those who want a little more background behind the photo: 

The photo was taken at the 2002 Tour de France, the rider is Dave Watson. The jump was over a group of 12 riders at the back of the pelaton during the Alp d'Huez stage, just before the summit of the col de Galibier. He only had a look at the jump before hand and couldn't even do a practice run in to the lip of the drop for fear of giving away his intentions to the many police below. After jumping the 45ft down on his Kona Stab Supreme, Dave unfortunately bailed pretty bad on the landing. After picking himself up he was taken to hospital but walked away that day with a partially separated shoulder, sore neck and a bruised back and groin.

The bag was confiscated and no major injuries were reported, although a few students were hospitalized as a precaution.

While my little brother was out playing on school grounds (either gym class or recess), he found a pocket knife on the field. Being a good kid with never an ill intent, he picked it up and took it straight to a teacher, and told her exactly where and how he found it. Instead of commending him  for turning it in immediately, the lady freaks out, shouting at my brother that 'how dare he bring a weapon to school'. She got him suspended, with the idea that ""well if it must have been his. He should have left it on the playground"". I was completely dumbfounded that the first response was that my brother was lying, that turning it over to proper authority meant nothing, and moreover, that he should have left a dangerous object on the playground, during a mixed-age recess.[**PUT YOUR HANDS UP WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM.

I didn't even have it out, it was just in my backpack but I guess someone told her or she saw it before and just decided to yell it out loud now. 

So a guy grabs me and pushes me to the ground and asks where is it. So I opened my backpack and gave it to him. 
They called my mom and she came to the school. They told her that I will get suspended and most likely expelled.

That aside, looking at where it says ""referral/infraction"" and it lists ""Sharp object/weapon"" is horribly misleading. Having bent tons of paperclips before, the worst you could do is poke an eye out. Which if that happened you'd figure the report would say ""Kid poked another kid's eye out.""

It's a small, quaint little town in central Washington, and it's Bavarian themed.  All of the buildings are made to look like a Bavarian mountain town.  There is a large Oktoberfest celebration every year, complete with polka bands, yodelers, and laderhosen (spelling?).My thoughts are with the people that give their lives so that ours may continue, many of us unaffected. I used to love Leavenworth when I was a kid.  Such a cool town to visit. Hopefully not too much is lost.

*[edit] Woo! My first ever gold! Thanks :)*You think that with all the practice they get they'd be better at it.i interviewed for an internship at United Airlines, and i'd like to reiterate how much of total fuckups they are.

[1] they flew me out there after a phone interview.  after a series of questions, it was obvious that i was in no way qualified for the job.  no big deal, free flight to chicago for me.

[2] my hotel reservation my first night there had been made for the wrong night.  luckily there was ample room at the four seasons where they put me up.  

[3] my return flight had been booked on the wrong date.  fortunately, i still had a room at the four seasons.  score!

[4] having a flight home on the wrong day, of course my meals were comped as part of the interview agreement.  so, i got two free days and nights in chicago on UA's dime.  not too bad!

[5] they kicked off the dude who was sitting next to me on the flight home because he was talking too loud while the flight steward was giving the speel about how to fasten seatbelts.  it turns out that he was really old and couldn't hear.  oh well, my carry on went into his seat and i got full leg room.

based on my experience, UA has a culture of ineptitude.  they gave me a great two days though.  And their office in the Willis Tower is sweet too, so they have that going for them, which is nice.I didn't know GLADOS has moved on to United Airlines.Sweet!  A specific item! I worked for Greyhound Buses out of college in the administrative offices. The guy who responded to customer complaints had a catalog of canned responses; send a #4 to this guy, or send a #8 to this woman. This was before word processors; they had what was called a ""typing pool"" back then, a room full of typists writing the same canned letters to people. Unbelievable!  You, <SUBJECT NAME HERE>, must be the pride of <SUBJECT HOMETOWN HERE>!A couple months ago, I finally spent the money I'd been saving on a three week dream trip to the UK from the US. I booked with Lufthansa because hell yeah, German efficiency! However, I had to have one connecting flight beforehand with United. F-ing United.

Plane is oversold, so I am kicked off. Waylaid for five hours. No problem, they say, and book me on a later flight. However, my entire itinerary is down the toilet, and I am no long flying with Lufthansa, it's United all the way across the pond. As I'm spending an *hour* waiting at the United ticket counter waiting for my new schedule to be finalized, the woman helping me mentions that my itinerary is in their system twice, would I like them to delete the duplicate? Sure, I say, not really caring at this point. This will become important later.

Finally get on a plane. It's cramped and old, but whatever. We taxi out of the gate and sit...and sit... no A/C so we're dying on the hot tarmac. Thirty minutes and the plane smells of old sweat and 30 years of farts escaping from the seat fabric. Finally get to take off. Land in Chicago and have to run to catch my next flight. Board the plane. Someone is in my seat. Compare tickets. We have the same seat number. Get off the plane. They screwed up. Stewardess enters and calls a passenger forward. Young woman gets up and immediately begins to cry as she leaves the plane. ""I've been waiting for 48 hours!"" she wails. She was flying standby and thought this was her chance to go home. I have robbed this woman and there's nothing to be done. Plane is cramped and old.

We land in New Jersey for the transatlantic hop. We stand like cattle on the gangway waiting for our bags to come out of the plane. We're outside, so we're boiling again. My next flight is looming. Still no bags. It's been 20 minutes. Some older folks are sitting down. The pilot checks his watch. Finally, the bags roll in, slowly. I grab mine and *run*.

I get to my flight just in time, and arrive panting at the gate. Duplicate ticket again, so sorry. End up sitting in between a lovely older couple visiting relatives in England. The TV barely works and one earphone is broken. Since my itinerary is shot, my vegetarian meal is no longer and option. I pick around the part that's probably meat.

We land in Manchester. I am exhausted but so damn excited at the same time. My seatmates were lovely and sweet, psyching me up. After a thorough grilling by Customs, I am free! I spend three weeks in the UK hiking, volunteering, and having a wonderful time. I return to Manchester airport poorer in money but richer in spirit, with mud on my boots and a wicked sunburn. This time, it's Lufthansa all the way, hooray!

Fly from Manchester to Dusseldorf on Eurowings without incident. Get to Dusseldorf... where do I go? I was only able to print one boarding pass for my first flight, can I print the rest here? After a long period of clicks on the computer, nice lady at the ticket counter is very confused. ""We see your itinerary... but we have no record that you are flying beyond this airport. You are flying to Chicago, yes?"" Panic begins to set in. We discuss further. Apparently, my further flights have been wiped from the system. I didn't pick up my bag, so it were sent to lost and found. Phone calls are made. A thought pings into my brain. With sudden clarity I remember the United rep who offered to ""clear up"" my duplicate itinerary. SHE HAD DELETED MY ENTIRE RETURN TRIP.

Finally, the hardworking Lufthansa ladies basically take my panicked word for it and secure a seat for me on my flight. I am grateful beyond words. Board plane. It's new and smells lovely. Onboard computer malfunctions during taxi. Get off the plane. Ten hour layover in the airport. Meal vouchers. Get back on another, almost-as-nice plane. Working TV, working headphones, and lots of drinks and snacks. I ask if there are any leftover vegetarian meals. Apologetic hostess returns with lots of fruit and a yogurt. I am grateful, then she returns again with an entire vegetarian meal from business class! Too much food to eat all at once, plus additional later snacks. F-yeah Lufthansa! Rest of the flight is brilliant, as I knew it would be.

End of the story, and I have an $800 voucher from United that I don't know what to do with. Think I'll save it for a family emergency, or if a close friend is in dire straights. No way I'm setting foot on one of their planes again unless I'm under extreme duress.

No one will probably read this, but damn it feels good to vent. Don't fly United, kids.Come on Mrs. Name. Didn't you enjoy the specific item?Further illustrating the unofficial motto: ""We don't care, we don't have to.""Please collect your luggage at (Specific war-torn country)Tweet this to UA. Is be curious to see their response.United treats their employees like shit.

Both my parents have worked for united as flight attendants for 30 years and are the sweetest people. 

But let me just clear this up, United employees aren't one big band of ""we hate you"", they're actually individual people in the service industry busting their asses dealing with rude assholes, just like you waiters do. And guess what? My parents aren't allowed to take tips either.

I'm not defending united by any means. In fact, I think the union is fucked up beyond belief. With my dad, mom, aunt and grandpa all having worked at united, they have ONE HUNDRED THIRTY years total dedicated to their company. Guess what my dad got for that? A fucking plaque. No pay raise, not shit. In fact, he gets paid less me cause united ""needs the money"". Oh, wanna know what another benefit is? United always does those ""mass firing"" things for employees. My parents benefits? They don't get fired. Yep that's all. 

And united is pretty fucking serious about keeping its name ""shiny and clean"". OP, if you had a bad experience with an employee and reported it, I can tell you that employee is probably fired already with no remorse, regardless of this crappy letter. BUT they weren't fired to satisfy you as a customer, it's because they wouldn't want to risk that employee making the same mistake, hence them getting another letter and making them look bad. They don't get a warning for screwing up, they get straight up fired. I've heard too many stories about it.


United doesn't just treat you guys like shit, they also treat their employees like shit. So if you do fly united, don't act like the stewardess is working with the big wigs and doesn't give a shit about you, because I can tell you my parents will be nice to you because they really do want you to have a good day. I think my parents are great employees and they get treated like crap because of things their superiors do.

My point is I fucking hate the ""higher ups"" of united. They treat you like shit, they treat my parents like shit. United doesn't give a fuck about anyone or anything but money. 



Well, last time I complained, (SPECIFIC ITEM) was a $500 check, so I'm not so upset about form letters.Seriously, fuck United Airlines. I had a two-hour flight delay during a work emergency. They promised to have a hotel for me at O'Hare, but they couldn't book hotels in another city (that's funny, because I have the amazing ability to book a hotel in a city in which I am not currently present in). When I got to O'Hare, there was a fucking two hour long wait to get hotel vouchers. There were five people being helped and a half hour later it was the same five people. When they finally started filtering away, the customer service employees *fucking left*. Seriously, it was like the DMV only worse because there was no place to sit.

So after an hour in line, this woman from United starts handing people hotel vouchers. ""Cool!"" I think, ""Maybe I'll get SOME modicum of sleep before I have to work all day in the middle of nowhere in the Sonora desert tomorrow!"" But oh no, she explained our flight was too small and the airline's policy is to only get hotel vouchers right away for flights of 30 or more. 

After this, this cheery, bubbly fucking goof started handing us these generic apology slips from United, complete with a phone number to an Indian customer service line than can't do shit about hotels. Nice! Sorry, but when I'm facing working in 100 degree heat with NO sleep I do not share your fucking enthusiasm!

By the time I got to the counter, 2 hours later, it was so late and my next flight was so early (due to the time crunch of the job), it wouldn't have been able to spend the night in a hotel even if I got one. Instead, I got three meal vouchers (which are fucking USELESS at O'Hare in the middle of the fucking night when nothing is open). I slept in the terminal for a few hours before getting on my flight...the rest of which were via American or US Airways and went extremely smoothly.

I will *NEVER* fucking fly United again. *EVER*. I understand that delays happen. I get it. But their sheer utter fucked-up-ness, and lack of giving-a-shit in their customer service department is fucking inexcusible. They should have been handing us hotel vouchers at the fucking gate as we got off.Pretty much all the complaints raised here are valid, but one of my biggest pet peeves about United is the semi-scammy way they set up salespeople right next to boarding gates to hock credit cards or timeshares, etc..  I had a long layover on a flight back from Jackson, WY last winter and I can't tell you how many old and confused travelers I watched get lured in by their slimy, grinning faces asking ""I'm with United, is there anything I can help you with?""  

Regardless of the response by the traveler, they'd go immediately into their sales pitch.  I even saw them ""assist"" a lady by following her up to the gate agent so they could continue harassing her about their credit cards or whatever.  

I paid for a plane ticket, not a condo presentation.I cannot say ""fuck United Airlines"" loudly or often enough.

Last time I flew with them (and it was the *last* time), they cancelled my connecting flight, lost my luggage (the luggage they unnecessarily forced me to gate check when there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments), told me they could probably get me on a plane in two or three days, gave me a one night hotel voucher and told me to fuck off.

I worked for the highways department here for a couple of summers as one of those guys that holds the ""slow/stop"" sign.

He stopped about 50yrds away after he realized it was spraying on his car.  Hopped out and came running over to me yelling about how i ""better be cleaning his fucking car"".  Told him if he dropped it off at the yard I'd happily clean it but that'd put me into OT and that the stuff we use to clean the tar would probably strip his paint but he was welcome to talk to my boss about it.

Edit*. Thank you, whomever, for my first gold.Is this covered on his insurance? How does he explain this one? that actually doesn't look too bad[deleted][deleted]Growing up in Nebraska, my dad often got caught behind slow-moving tractors and horse trailers and such. There was this one guy, farmer Fred who would purposefully slow down in front of cars to piss them off. One day, my dad passed farmer Fred and flipped him off. Now, farmer Fred keeps cows and horses and has quite the dung collection; he'd sell it to the locals for their gardens. He knew where my dad lived, and thought he could exact some revenge by unloading a large shipment of manure, and claiming he got the address wrong.

Joke was on him, though. My sister and I loved that shit pile. We would dig caves in it, and carved it into our own secret cowshit clubhouse where our parents wouldn't follow us.

I imagine they appreciate the outpouring of support, we just need to respect the family's wishes.It has also been shared by a Dutch newpaper (without asking the father for permission, sadly). People already posted it on the Dutch subreddit: http://imgur.com/WsJciP2Every now & then, Reddit. Every now & then..This almost makes up for the time we witch hunted, stalked, and sent death threats to a sexual assault victim because she had training in makeup and special effects and could have faked her injuries! Or the time we sent death threats to a guy responsible for transporting a Jurassic Park prop Jeep across the country and failed at it. Or the time we sent death threats to a feminist video game blogger. Or the time we stalked and got a guy fired from his job for not giving us enough free Steam keys. Or the time we stalked and sent death threats to a kidney donor because we thought his pics were fake and he was trying to steal money from us, despite asking for donations to the American Cancer Society. Or the time we stalked and sent death threats to a redditor and entire extended family because we thought he was a corporate shill working for Olive Garden. Or the time we stalked and sent death threats to multiple redditors because we thought they were corporate shills working for Facebook after they bought the Oculus Rift. Or the time we stalked and sent death threats to multiple redditors because we thought they were corporate shills working for Microsoft because they were posting about the Xbox One too often. Or the time we gave a guy posting sexually suggestive photos of people without them knowing a golden reddit trophy award and hailed him as reddit's #1 poster. Or the time we flooded a college's rape reporting hotline with fake reports to drown out legit ones. Or the time we discovered a conspiracy to cover up the worst nuclear disaster in US history, and bravely overwhelmed local 911 and news station switchboards with alerts that thousands of people were about to die from radiation poisoning, all based on the rambling post of a schizophrenic.Just noticed they had some sort of campaign ""Geddit - The best of Reddit.""

And how thick is that sheet of clear ice covering it? Like could you walk across it?How do they know it's 1,000 feet deep?  I believe holes like these are formed after melt water has accumulated on the surface and heats up faster than the surrounding reflective ice. It then melts more ice and finds cracks to flow out of erroding the glacier.  They say it can sometimes accelerate the melting of a glacier as it can increase its ability to break off earlier.

can you step on it?The way that the light is diffusing tells me that there is actually water underneath the ice.

The angle that the picture is taken (almost straight downwards) would make it seem like there is no water due to the small effect of refraction.

He did it so smoothly you can't tell if you're watching real time. It's pretty amazing, this guy knew what he was doing the whole time!

Then, in the airport, they were taking all of our temperatures with the same thermometer without STERILIZING IT (in the ear one).

It's a parade that features tribal leaders as well as beautiful dances from different tribes all over the U.S.A.Oorah gentlemen, enjoy your final post! Semper fi[deleted]I remember when I was a kid the thrill of talking with people that fought in WW1. My great grandfather fought in WW2 and I can remember a few years ago standing in the Baltimore airport as the entire terminal clapped, saluted, bowed their eyes, and removed their covers for WW2 veterans. I remember talking with a code talker at elementary school. Just last weekend a Korean War vet noticed my haircut, exited his table, and we enjoyed biscuits and gravy together. Every year the memories become stronger as they leave this changed world. So very sad. Rest in peace. My Great Uncle who is still alive was one of the first men on the beach of normandy. When he recounts what he saw and went through it is with awe that we sit and listen. He does have quite a few funny stories too. I remember watching Band Of Brothers with him and holding his hand as he cried. He couldnt watch the whole thing. To close to home he said. Thank u to all that serve. Dammit. :(

Rest in peace mighty warriors. You helped your nation when your nation still wasn't doing anything for you. I am sorry we have failed you so.The empty chairs is what got me...kinda a metaphor for ""gone but never forgotten.""Wow. Hardest pit in my stomach I've ever felt. Those empty chairs. Damn.I admit I teared up more than I planned. I thank them for their service and sacrifice.My grandfather died 4 days before the 70th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. He was such a proud veteran. I'm sad he didn't make it to his 90th birthday. But I'm even more upset that he didn't make it to the 70th anniversary. He deserved it.

This post made me cry quite a bit. Gone, but definitely never, ever forgotten.

Thank you.I was just trying to describe to my young son the incredible courage and moral high ground that was required of the Code Talkers.  Most of them were only a two or three generations removed from the great tragedies that were imparted on Native Americans during the late 1800s. 

Imagine having the Anglos ask you to help them defeat a great evil.  There is a lot of painful irony in that request. I hope that this float continues to parade every year. Damn you! You made me ruin my eyeliner! Punk ass I missed out on the Gallup Ceremonial, I'm sure they'll have the float at the Navajo Fair, it's a bummer, but life goes on and we will be losing more and more in our tribe.

Where is the sand or whatever it used to be, what is this new technology like astro turf for ants? Brb, going to play SimAnt Looks like they were trying to spell HITLER but ran out of room.If you really want to get into ant farming, give up on this one - it can only sustain feeding some worker ants for a while, but if they dont have a queen ant their lives are pointless and will just dig around in it till they die.
You can't start a real colony in the gel because it doesn't have proper humidity gradient and eggs wont be able to develop. You can easily build a nest for a real colony with household materials, and have even more fun observing a proper complete colony.
The season is perfect for it (summer), right now ant queens are just running around sidewalks after mating, trying to dig a hole to live in and it's easy to catch one. If you want more info PM me.Ant Lover Here! (hahaha)

Those are really, really bad for your ants. They aren't really digging to make a new home (because there is no queen) but rather digging out of desperation due to not knowing where exactly they are. The green gel also significantly reduces their lifespan. If you want to seriously keep ants I suggest your standard ant farm (that is, if you aren't keeping a queen) or checking out some of the [plaster mold farms.] (http://6legs2many.wordpress.com/techniques/homemade-ant-farm/)

it doesn't provide them what they need and they'll end up dying.

buy a proper formicarium or even just make one it doesn't cost too much

and remember they need to eat sweet food like honey and the queen needs her protein.

(Apologies if I've misidentified any of them as Homs if they're Aleppo, etc.)I passed through Homs a few times on my trip to Syria a few years ago... just in time. The civil war started 3 weeks after I was there.War doesn't determine who's right - only who's left. 

-Bertrand Russell 
They made peace in Homs.  Both sides agreed to a ceasefire in May and it's held.  There's hope that the ceasefire in Homs can serve as a model for Aleppo.50 thousand people used to live there....now it's a ghost town.This is, unfortunately, some seriously chilling /r/HellscapePorn stuff. It really is sad to see.What filter is that?looks like Europe in 1945Umm its 80 degrees in Homs right now....

Edit: for the record not commenting on anything besides the fact this image is not current It there any way they could or would rebuild? Will it become barren for the rest of life? That place is FUCKED up. Damn.Tragic. So much destruction...I wonder how well Krak des Chevaliers has held up during the civil warThis country has so much history. Scary how we are losing so much of it.war turns everything colorful into black and white.Fuck war.To think that's where I was born 27 years ago....sad times looking at thisThis reminds me of the ruins of Warsaw from ""The Pianist.""I tried to zillow some of these properties but alas no go.All this fighting for what? Who really wants to rebuild this and live here now? The winners get to stand over a pile of rubble? Violence on this scale only ever hurts the weakest. Fuck this shit, god fucking dammit - I'm so mad I can't create coherent thoughts.Is it weird i hear the ""Terminator"" theme when i look at this picture Totally worth supporting the syrian rebels! What a great outcome, mission accomplished, democracy has prevailed, *huzzah*It's a post-apocalyptic scene if I ever saw one. Just...damn.I can't comprehend living like this.

Edit: Cool, gold. Thanks. 

Edit: 2x gold. Nice one.Would be cool to see a picture taken in the same location in the present day and then compare to this photo.Not one telephone pole is straight..Looks like Godspeed You! Black Emperor has a new album cover [deleted]NYC in the 70's is so fascinating to me. It was an untamed jungle, dangerous, run-down, gritty...... so many different cultures exploding all at once, both violent, sexual, yet infinitely creative. Music was radical and controversial, whether it was Lou Reed talking about drugs and sex, or some of the early hip-hoppers in the Bronx causing chaos..... absolutely wild. The golden age of film has just begun, the Scorsese/Coppola/Pacino/De Niro/Hoffman era was in full effect. It was just so damn..... cool. I feel like everything nowadays is bland, I hate that I'm part of Generation Y. War... War never changes...The 1970's were a horrible, dirty, stinking decade.[deleted]This here is a top quality submission, thanks OP.This is very cool.

Residents who have lived there a couple years have the thighs of gods. [A video, from 2007.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryCWIjdVF0g)This is even better than riding a wood pallet.I think this is awesome. No one wants to ride their bike up that hill. (sirmuskrat's link) And Im sure there are plenty of people who think ""I dont mind riding to work (or town or whatever) but I hate riding back up. I will just take my car instead.""

Adding this much be really quite cheap. It saves on wear and tear on the roads, less cars in the city, increased health so less money spent on health care. Its cheaper and better than public transport. I wish these where everywhere, and more designated cycle paths but thats a whole other thing.If this was the US, it would be  ""Lazy fatties can't ride up hills!""Yeah that thing is handy, the hill is steep as fuck and just as long.

It should be noted that Trondheim has bicycles stationed around the cty that anyone with a card can use whenever they feel like it and just drop it of at another station.guy on bottom left doesn't even have his foot on anything... What the fuck that's advanced!Bike ski lift.
This is in Trondheim, the city where Olav the holy was buried under the Nidaros cathedral. This is perfect for when you want to ride your bike but don't want to ride your bike! Will it work with my bike?

Where in norway is this?I'd give it 2 days in the States before a law suit is filed on the manufacturer, installer, and inventor.Goddamn Scandinavian utopiasYou would get sued to fuck all in the US if you installed this.This looks like it'd be kinda fun. Like a rope tow on a small ski hill. That escalated quickly.I can think of about 5 different hills right by my house that could use this. They're practically impossible to get up on a bike otherwise.DC Cyclists are lobbying to have this exact same product installed on 15th St., right next to Meridian Park.  Count me in.I live in Toronto and our office just moved - it's now twice as far to cycle and the trip there is - no joking - mostly up hill the whole way.  If anyone knows Toronto well, they'll back me up when I say this - if you're going from Bloor north to Lawrence West, it's a series of several 30 degree (up) hills.  I've been cycling through the city for the past 20+ years and for the first time in as long as I can remember I actually have to get off and walk up some of these hills.  

I'd love something like this.

According to the post there, this is located in Oregon.Reminded me of Portal 2.[deleted]That's beautiful.But...where's Courage?I love this kind of stuff. One of my favorite things is when I am driving through a small town that time had somehow forgot and you see all these rundown and abandoned buildings that at one time inhabited people. 

I always like to try and imagine what that town was like, say, 50 years prior to me seeing it. I'm sure at one time that place I'm driving through wasn't an absolute shit hole. Here's the [same picture at five times the size](http://i.imgur.com/0XTNq69.jpg); for what it's worth, it was taken by [Jeff Edes](http://www.jeffedesphotography.com/).This scene is all too common on the Canadian prairies. As farming became more and more industrialized, family farming ceased to be profitable and populations became increasingly urban. A great many old homesteads have been left abandoned. This image symbolizes the decline of the family farm in my eyes. anyone knows is there's a bigger resolution?I love how dramatic the color scheme is, the endless hay and the wonderful blue sky coming together, here is a more modern approach to this photo, enjoy!

Do you take a video and then just use a cool looking frame, or do you actually try to snap a picture at the perfect time?OU is a great place for storm watching. They have their own source of electricity, so even if power goes out in the whole city, they will still have power (I know cause I had to camp out in the union one winter for a few days when I lost power in the ice storm). Also lots of underground areas to hide in a tornado (also have done this).

The slides costs thousands and thousands of dollars to repack.  Not only that, but the plane has to be taken out of commission, which will affect future flights for days/weeks.   Will the airline let that slide ?So this can easily happen. Egress slides are installed into aircraft doors, and clipped into the floor of the aircraft. If the door opens during flight, the slide will inflate. If the slide is not unclipped prior to opening the door on the ground, it will inflate. What it looks like to me is this: crew forgot to unclip slide after landing - the stand was pushed up and when the crew opened the door to disembark the aircraft, the slide did exactly what it was supposed to do.

Source: USAF Flightline maintenance

edit: Another explanation could be someone's luggage or shoe or anything really caught the clip of the slide (think of it like a rip cord for a parachute) and pulled it causing the slide to pop - in the case I pity the fool, because it'd suck to be right there when it happens!I was waiting for this flight. I ended up chartering a flight with my buddies from petersburg to juneau so we good hop on the later flight up to Anchorage. Apparently a flight attendant forgot to disarm the slide, and when she opened the door it deployed. At least he knows it works!It only makes sense that in the event of an Alaskan crash, you would deploy a path up out of the snow.The plane saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/hS833.jpg) [NSFW].Hope no one was hurt.

I've been to a few islands that have amazingly beautiful beaches like this, but everything else is a complete dump.

I call bullshit on Maldives.If being at work and looking out the window at dark skies and pouring rain wasn't depressing enough. Beautiful place.  Fucked up culture.As beautiful as that is, I would never visit Maldives. From Wikipedia,

> Islam is the official religion of the Maldives and open practice of any other religion is forbidden and liable to prosecution. Article 2 of the revised constitution says that the republic ""is based on the principles of Islam."" Article nine says that ""a non-Muslim may not become a citizen""; Article ten says that ""no law contrary to any principle of Islam can be applied"". Article nineteen states that ""citizens are free to participate in or carry out any activity that is not expressly prohibited by sharia [Islamic law] or by the law.""

> The requirement to adhere to a particular religion and prohibition of public worship following other religions is contrary to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Great picture but i like ambergris caye the largest island of Belize that's really amazing island : http://www.worldofpctures.com/ambergris-caye/Beautiful, but not $734/night beautiful.Whenever i see pictures like this and think I would love to go swimming there, I take a look at the hotel rooms again, and wonder ""when people shit in the bathroom there...where does it go?

In general each island is surrounded by a shallow lagoon, then a reef, and then the water depth plummets.

Your walls will be very prettyJust imagine what she could do with bad tattoos. The kid was going for a more interpretive piece When I was a kid I was at a friends house who was painting his room.  He asked me if I could help him.  Keep in mind we are not simply painting his room, we are drawing cool things on the walls.  At one point we draw an alien with a huge penis on the side of his room.  His mom checks our work after we're done and see what we've done.  She turns the penis into a solar system.  To give you perspective on how large this penis was. One of my siblings painted the wall with feces. i'd like to see how you'd fix that one.You just got schooled, (actual) son!  You can't step to my drawing game.  This is (literally) my house!I would have gotten an ass-whooping and been forced to go pick up cans along the road until I could afford new paint for the entire room. 

But that's none of my business. This kid won't have to do any school projects. See that? That's art you little shit.That kid must be pretty tallMy mom was only creative enough to beat the shit out of me in such a situation.

...Then again, I didn't do it more than once.My creativity would have been to paint over it.One time I wrote my sisters name on the wall in an attempt to frame her. She was 5 and could totally write her name. I made sure to write it all shitty so it was more convincing, it was the perfect plan but I fucking did it to high on the wall and my mom knew immediately that it was me and I got a real swift spanking on the spot when she confronted me and then had to go pick out a spoon out from the drawer for her to hit my hands with. And that's pretty much turning a frown upside down One of those moms that always has to one up their kids.

Edit:  ~700 and I'm [done for now](http://i.imgur.com/37g1bb4.jpg)Mushrooms that grow on tree bark are spread by wind-blown spores. They usually infect older trees, or injured trees. Boring insects, high winds, fire, ice, lightning and snow all can cause wounds that are susceptible to infection by mushroom spores. There is little you can do to prevent their appearance or eliminate them once they get started. If the fungus grows on a branch, you can prune the branch, leaving a collar around the wound. Do not leave a stub. A tree weakened by bark mushrooms, especially those that cause brown rot, can fall and injure people or damage property. If you have an infected tree, you should have it inspected regularly by a qualified arborist to see if wood decay is serious, or sacrifice it for a temporary magnificent view such as this one.

x-post /r/ArtefactPorn[deleted]Fuckin' German engineering. Even back then...It always blows me away to see the amazing and intricate things that people could create *hundreds* of years ago without the help of modern tools and machines.I was in the locksmith business for 15 years. My coworkers and I often looked for design flaws and weaknesses in locking mechanisms. It appears that this lock has a design flaw weakness with the hinge pin on the left side of the shackle. It looks as though it could be pounded out possibly with a hammer and pin.Reminds me of SkyrimI wish we still used locks like this, that lock is damn sexy. Where do I stick it in?


 ...the key that is... This is genious. The Germans made cool locks so that when a thief came, he noticed the lock and decided to steal the rad lock instead of whatever was inside. The owner then had enough time to hide the unprotected items before the thief came back because he noticed that he could have checked if there was something in the vault/jewel box/whatever.

Edit: You guys are way too serious. Relax a little.The bottom part looks like the eyes, nose and mustache of a manDeutsche Qualität.the lock looks like the mask of Midna from Twilight Princess

A little history about the 88th Infantry Division in WW II from a
documentary film.

“The Blue Devils Come Home,” a documentary film by Jeffrey Wisotsky, chronicles the remarkable heroism of the soldiers of the 88th Infantry Division fighting to defeat Hitler’s armies in Italy during World War II. They were kids from New York City who became one of the great fighting units in military history.

The Broadway Soldiers!  They were kids from New York City drafted to fight a war thousands of miles from home.  Who knew what to expect when these kids, many of them first-generation Americans, were drafted off the streets of New York and into the 88th Infantry Division in 1942?  Then, through 344 consecutive days of combat against Hitler’s armies in the mountains and valleys of Italy, they became the “Blue Devils,” members of one of the great fighting units in military history.  Intercut with rare period motion picture and still photography, THE BLUE DEVILS COME HOME introduces some American heroes for this and all of time.

I took this photo here! http://imgur.com/2h4SUSLPretty friggin awesome!/r/PastAndPresentPics Great picture... Horrible posture. I can hear him yelling SIT UP STRAIGHT SON.Seriously post this to /r/colorizationrequests. If no one has done it in the next 3 hours i'll do it myself. A little to the left...Great picture.Is wearing an Italia shirt in Italy comparable to wearing an ""I <3 NY"" shirt in manhattan ? Aka something only tourists do ? 

I actually heard that it's pretty common even for natives. I was there a couple months ago and it's amazing that the only bridge the Nazis didn't destroy was the Ponte Vecchio.I sat there too, on tour with a band in May. Florence is a beautiful cityAhh, another member of the famous Florence redecorating committee.Wow, that's pretty wild. Thanks for posting it!

Give props to American made products.. I thought I would share some of the pics I took building it. Cant figure out how to post my video and abide my the rules, otherwise I would show my videos.

We were hired to make this slide. Give props to Bare Naked Granola for keeping it American made. It's not easy competing against foreign inflatable manufacturers. 

Devin Super Tramp crew were great!! All the people that participated in the commercial were great. It will be neat to see who make's it into the final video cut. I saw a lot of good style and skill. ... and Im pretty sure the age limitation was an insurance limitation for this commercial video shoot. 

My favorite was watching the Rubber Ducky go down the slide.

http://youtu.be/p5CMN5gbufg[video of it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuvSz3_Lyps)California: Ignoring severe drought conditions since 1973. 

People spend all day bitching about San Francisco, gentrification, housing prices, traffic...etc...

Sometimes it's nice to see something like this and remember that this town is really fucking fun to live in.No wonder.  Home of the Giants, remember?Damn it! I was in San Francisco this weekend and I didn't know about this.I was really hoping that thing at the end was one of those police speed trailers that tells drivers how fast they are going. [Here's a video I shot going down the slide.](http://youtu.be/h5ePZeJetKY) It was awesome. This video isn't perfect — it was shot at half-speed from an inflatable donut which began spinning out of control on the way down, so there's a lot more blue sky footage than anyone needs — but at almost exactly the middle there's a funny shot of the look on my face, and right at the end there's a pretty fantastic shot of the guy behind me grinning hugely. 

I don't think I've ever gone so quickly from ""Most exciting thing all year!"" to ""I'm going to die!"" as when I first saw the tangle of limbs clotting up around the entrance to the pool I was about to slam into at full ramming speed. Still, totally worth it.

I have a better video of the descent. I'll come back and add a link to it later.

Edit, copied from another comment: [Here's a (better) POV video I took.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4qMbg9GRiI&feature=youtu.be) It was my first time using the camera and I didn't have the record lock set — so about two-thirds of the way down, when I realized how much trouble I was in given how fast I was going and how slowly people were clearing out of the way down below, my body clenched, including my thumb, which stopped the recording, but it gives you a pretty good idea of what it was like, at half-speed.California is in the middle of a fucking drought and someone decides to build a block long slip and slide.  Thats 1/4 the length it should be.The first person to test this has the biggest balls I have ever seen.I guess anything slides over there Is this the place where Mythbusters tested the Toy Car vs Real Car myth?Does anyone own a car in SF? Does parking on hills like that always fuck up your tranny easily? I have a hill going to my house garage and I detest having to park outside. Every time I go in reverse it doesn't feel right.In the words of George Takei, upon first learning of ""Trekkies' "" existence:

Holy crap.

Edit: Linking. Thanks /u/billbagginsI don't think being short should give you a free pass to stand all over furniture in your shoes, come on nowShe has the body of a toddler, but has she actually developed at all? Has she undergone puberty, or because she's so small, did her body just not allow it?I bet she has to watch out for hawks and shit.The range of heights humans can have amazes me. She's so tiny and yet humans can be over 7'. Even up to nearly 9'. It's crazy to think about. 

I can't imagine she'll have a long life span so I hope however long she is around for she has a nice life. She weighs just 11lbs.  Surprisignly, she's not the shortest woman in history. This title continues to be held by Pauline Musters (Netherlands, 1876-1895) who measured just 61cm (24in).

Has this already happened?Ever since I saw her online I've always been intrigued by Jyoti and her life experience. She seems so happy and yet i know she has to deal with some profoundly hard things in her life because of her size. She has the entire celebrity thing going on but you can tell she just wants to be considered normal because that is how she views herself, except in an extremely little body. 

I think if I ever met her I would have a lot of questions for her. 

I hope she continues to stay healthy and happy and does good in college. http://i.imgur.com/qZySk4K.jpgShe should apply to astronaut training.  Maximal payload to orbit efficiency.  Also if she is captured by aliens they will think humans are adorable.It's crazy to me she's old enough to drink but after 2 drinks would be on the verge of a comaI can't imagine it would be easy to get so many people literally and figuratively looking down on you. It must be hard to be angsty and brooding like all the rest of the world's teenagers sometimes when everyone thinks you're too adorable to have anything but the emotional range of a 5 year old.Yet another unrealistic body standard for women.Sweet, she can go to the bar. And probably get blackout drunk 3 sips into a daiquiri.What would happen if she were to be impregnated? Would she die because the baby would be bigger than her or would she create a new mini human ?I like to think she's normal size but visiting the house of a giant with giant furniture and giant newspapers and giant unopened soccer balls I want to see her walk out of a liquor store with a 40oz.I bet you could use her to pull off some phat heists. She could pretend to be 3 yes old. None will suspect a toddler to be able to operate a computer. For whatever reason, [I like this picture of her](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02086/coke-bottle_2086673i.jpg). We need a pic of her with ShaqShe's used to everyone being larger but I think I would just be in a state of bewilderment if I met her. She must get pretty sick of people just staring in amazement. Honestly those shoes look cute on her.I saw a documentary on her once, and my impression was because she's so small, she's often treated like a little baby and thus acts like one. The documentary took place while she still lived in her hometown. I think she was thought to be a reincarnation of a deity. Anyways, she had some bone issues that needed to be addressed so the documentary ended at the doctor's office where she was freaking out over getting a shot, and the nurse was extremely unimpressed with how she was acting for a teenager. Given needles are huge for her, but her reaction was like a two year old.

Was she like that at all?

EDIT: I can't find the actual documentary, but it's from the National Geographic Channel and is called [The World's Smallest Girl](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/galleries/episode-the-worlds-smallest-girl/). She had some broken bones in her legs that wouldn't heal properly. Looks like they're fixed now, so that's good!

DOUBLE EDIT: I get the fear of needles thing as I myself have to look away when I get blood drawn. In the documentary, she was consistently acting like a spoiled brat since she was being treated *very* well. Her reaction to needles was not normal for a 16 year old, and she was cradled by her mother when she started bawling. 

The nurse was using the smallest needle possible for her tiny veins. God, they wouldn't dare stick the equivalent of a quarter inch needle in the poor girl's arm. That's just silly. The doctors and nurses have common sense.","{'Sadness': 0.047448, 'Emotional_Range': 0.879, 'Tentative': 0.799, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.848599, 'Analytical': 0.493, 'Conscientiousness': 0.058, 'Agreeableness': 0.839, 'Joy': 0.052808, 'Disgust': 0.057147, 'Extraversion': 0.839, 'Openness': 0.094, 'Anger': 0.531838}",{'person': 0.900249}

We always draped the hallway walls with rolls of paper and let the patients have at it. Some of the most beautiful awesome artwork would be on the walls. Schizophrenics were the best.

http://imgur.com/97usmUQHey guys, sorry I'm a bit late to clear up some of the questions. The picture was given to me by the inmate several years ago. I recently found it in a drawer and figured you guys would enjoy it. In case you're wondering this isn't a HIPPA violation because I haven't released his name or let alone where our jail even is. The signature at the bottom is not his name and I believe he signs his artwork with something different every time. I'll try and do an AMA later when I have some time and I'll post a link. Thanks again for the karma, but I hope everyone realizes how serious of an issue mental health in jail settings is. This particular inmate is unfortunately very unstable and is usually held for petty crimes. We need more state run treatment facilities for guys like him. Hopefully soon people will become more aware of the issues surrounding jails and those with MHMR issues > **inmate** with severe paranoid schizophrenia

Sigh. Not your fault, you didn't put him there, but jail is not the place for the mentally ill. Go, Team America!

Very compelling imagery, though.[deleted]That thing belongs in Berserk mangaAnyone interested in this should consider checking out [Nick Blinko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Blinko).  He was the lead in '80s British anarcho-punk band [Rudimentary Peni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudimentary_Peni#Discography) (still the greatest name for a punk band ever).

You can find a little bit of his art [here](http://www.outsiderart.co.uk/blinko.htm), but I prefer the artwork he did for their albums, like [Death Church](https://www.google.com/search?q=rudimentary+peni+death+church+art&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Sh3uU8TKLIiZyASb8oK4Dw&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=667) and [Cacophony](https://www.google.com/search?q=rudimentary+peni+death+church+art&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=GhzuU7ndC4aryASphICADw&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=667#q=rudimentary+peni+cacophony+art&tbm=isch&imgdii=_).

His mental state also leaked heavily into their music, and it's kind of a fascinating listen at times (if you can get over the fact that it is, in fact, 80's British anarcho-punk - it's not for everyone).  [Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Pope+Adrian+37th+Psychristiatric/7342838) is probably the best example, as he actually wrote most of it while in a psychiatric hospital for believing that he was [Pope Adrian 37th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Adrian_37th_Psychristiatric).Pink Floyd: lost album art.It's nice they let inmates read Berserk.Sometimes it seems as if there is a very thin line between brilliance and insanity. This is pretty amazing artwork. I sincerely hope he gets the proper care to get better control over his disease.   It is profoundly sad that many of the mentally disturbed just get dumped into the jail/prison system that is ill equipped to deal with their needs. Wow. This is amazing.Interesting and very revealing. This is basically an expression of the fractured ego typical of people who suffer from schizophrenia. Also, notice the abundance of eyes. Paranoid schizophrenics often put great emphasis on the eyes because their entire psychological makeup revolves around vigilance. Everything is a threat and everything must be watched out for, all the time. This picture is very dramatic because it shows how this person's mind has been overrun by the disease. We can infer this by the fact that his ""self-portrait"" contains mostly heads. This often indicates that the person's life is completely dominated by something of a mental nature. he is in a losing battle with his condition.

EDIT: One of the dumbest jokes I've ever made is now my highest rated comment. Great.Any idea what caused this?These are the kind of events people would write in their holy books back in the day. Aang is fighting the firelord.Is the island tipping over?I would guess a cumulonimbus cloud which can sometimes reach over 50,000 feet in altitude.This is an interesting phenomena that actually takes place with relative consistency over the course of the year. This is caused through light particles refracting less due to a drastic temperature change that is usually brought on by an approaching storm. As the light hits the warmer air particles in front of the stormfront it acts normally, whereas it is slowed down enough by the cooler particles being pushed through to appear darker on the electromagnetic spectrum. 

It is usually no so pronounced except when occurring in the Pacific due to specific air currents that aid in the drastic change in temperatures over the course of a few feet. It is widely debated why there is such solid movement of the pockets of cooled air and why the air doesn't homogenize especially when being pushed over islands such as Guam. The leading researchers suggest that this phenomenon, called diculous butticulous could also be responsible for many of the storms across the globe. There is an interesting graphical representation of this in full effect that was published by the Weather Channel after they did a joint study with the National Hurricane Center.

It was probably a missile of some sort originally.It's there a video of this? Cause I wanna see the video of this...She came out of the water at 24.4 mph according to my physics/math.
She also had the same amount of kinetic energy that a mid size car (3500lbs) would have going about 52 mph.

edit: this is also the first time I have ever put physics to use for plain ol' fun!
Note: this is all assuming 20 ft and 8 tons are somewhat accurate.

Edit: thanks for the gold :) and I was challenged to incorporate the orca's horizontal velocity into this equation since I ignored it (we of course can't measure exactly how far she went horizontally). I estimated it to be 24 feet compared to her 20 feet height using the pics posted by /u/KnightOfSunlight and so we have new numbers.

Her new velocity is 25.5 mph coming out of the water which compares with the kinetic energy of a medium sized car going 54.6mph!

Changed it to a girl since /u/lolsmasher said it was a girl!

So many edits: I certainly don't mean to disappoint people so hopefully you aren't but if we look [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2377154/Eight-ton-orca-leaps-15ft-air-finally-capture-dolphin-hour-chase.html) we see it was probably closer to a 15 foot jump and it isn't clear if it was really 8 tons. I used the number 7257kg for the weight which doesn't seem too crazy as far as orcas go but this one was probably not much more than half that weight. It was probably traveling closer to 22mph and if it was a 4-5 ton whale its kinetic energy was probably closer to that of a medium sized car going 35mph. Regardless of the numbers the picture is still pretty flippin' insane.[Here's more frames](http://imgur.com/a/KlE5f)

[Source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2377154/Eight-ton-orca-leaps-15ft-air-finally-capture-dolphin-hour-chase.html)I once took my young nieces fishing with off north Vancouver Island in Canada.  As we heading past a place called Double Bay (not far from Telegraph Cove for a reference), we noticed a number of whale watching boats.  

I shut off the motor and let us drift so the girls could see the Orcas.  Turned out there were not one but three separate pods, one of which passed in front of us, one passed by off to our starboard and one pod swam right around us, even passing under our 16 ft boat.   Hence the whale watching boats!  Three pods in proximity is (as far as I know) nearly unheard of.

The girls were terrified and thrilled all at once.  Not only did they get to see these magnificent animals in an abundance that few people can say they had seen, but they were so close you could almost touch them.   

Needless to say that while we had a great day fishing it was rather anti-climatic.We have lift off.

http://imgur.com/gallery/MkKu2tU/newBELLY FLOP!!!That kind of jump requires about the same speed as Usain Bolt, when leaving the water.
___
A 6 meter drop takes about 1.105s, and therefore the way up will take 1.105s as well.

d = vt + at^2 /2 => 6m = v*1.105s - 9.82 m/s^2 * (1.105s) ^2 /2 => v = 10.85m/s or about 11m/s

100m / 10.85 m/s => 9.22 seconds and considering Usain has to accelerate, he will be around 11 m/s as well at the end of his 100m sprint.Wow that would be a wonderful to see.And Seaworld still say its perfectly fine to keep them in a tank not much bigger the 20ftEvery damn time I see an orca that damn MJ song plays in my head!

A few weeks ago, I was biking home from the grocery store when a carton of eggs fell out of my basket and broke on the ground. I stopped to clean it up when a older Japanese women approached me and said that I should leave it for the birds. I took the empty carton back home, but felt bad about leaving a mess on the sidewalk. So I took a towel and walked back to where I dropped them.

Every time I fly, I am searched thoroughly. Most of the time it goes relatively quickly, and is done by people who understand how silly it is.

When you're instructed to go see ""Serious Sam,"" however, who is going to milk the search for every ounce of self-importance he can ring out of it, things get pretty frustrating.

Remove your shoes. Lift your legs. Lift your arms. Lift yourself up off your seat so they can look under you. Be patted down. Be patted down again while lifting yourself up again. Sit with your hands on your lap as they inspect your chair. Get out of your chair so they can look it over without you in it. Etc.

The search even includes swabbing your hands and chair for explosive residue(s), because as we all know, the anger which accompanies having weakened legs often leads to terroristic attacks.

All of this, and there is one thing I have yet to have checked when I've gone through security, which would be the best/easiest place to hide something. Some may know or be able to figure out where I mean, but I'm not going to include it in my comment, because it would make the search take up even more time, and also because, well, fuck them.

Also, take it from me: NEVER ask just what exactly the test is intended to detect. You become very suspicious at that point.

The US has truly turned into a police state when someone that was previously in the service and held one of the highest security clearances that are disclosed(NATO TS) continuously gets harassed by the government, it has become and embarrassment to our ""free"" lives.

TSA is only an illusion of security.  When those that pose no threat are constantly harassed, the ones that want to get by, will get by, as they have several times previously.

Damn, that just makes it worse. I analyze and prepare post-foreclosure properties for HUD insurance claims and I find that these kinds of notes are the worst. But I also get some where the borrower made the first payment and none other. One couple lived in their ""home"" seven years after paying one payment. 

Sadly I see more of the former than the latter.As someone who too has lost the family home....( a business that failed with a secured loan on the property )..it's the most awful thing imaginable at the time...but now 8 years later..living in rented accommodation, and a regular factory job...it made me value the things that matter most, a fantastic wife that after 38 years has stuck by me and a terrific family with grandkids,..and time to spend with them instead of working 12-14 hour days, if someone had told me then, that I would one day be back on my feet and thinking positively about the future, I would not of believed them...but to anyone who is in that position currently, ....as terrible as it is at the time..and honestly I know it is, you do come out the other end.I changed professions in 2007 from retail management to locksmithing. It was a perfect time to break into the business as foreclosure houses soon became a booming business that a rookie could handle easily. 

From 2008 to about 2011 or so I was regularly rekeying 3 to 5 of these foreclosures a day. It was unreal the never ending stream of houses that were abandoned. It started on the outskirts of the city where the drive till you qualify buyers had purchased huge houses on lots where their neighbors roofs were in jumping distance. Then slowly it spread inward till every neighborhood had at least one on every street. I ended up rekeying a third of the houses in my own neighborhood. 

You never knew what you would find when you opened that door for the first time. Some houses were never lived in, others were apparently occupied by animals. Some were stripped to the bone with all cabinets, appliances and even light fixtures removed. Others told a tale of slow a burn realization that their dream house was a fantasy. 

One that stands out was like this. I picked open the front door and was greeted by a bowl of Halloween candy on a door side book shelf, it's April. All of the furnishings were still there beds, clothes in the closets, fridge still full of rotted food, even a pool table. I walked into the kitchen the center island was covered with bills and bank notices most unopened. As i turned into the living room I saw the first 24 pack of beer with 24 empty cans strewn over the coffee table. Then the dinning room table same scene 24 pack box 24 empty cans. Then the outside patio two separate seating areas both with the 24 pack treatment. I pictured the poor bastard drinking himself into a stupor in all these different spots of the house as he slowly came to accept the end. Then when the drinking was finally enough he just got up and left it all. How freeing in a way that must have been, but also how sad to find on a sunny April Wednesday before lunch.My wife works for a company underneath a law firm that gives notice of foreclosure via process servers. The law firm is contracted by big banks to execute the foreclosure. My wife says she gets calls sometimes from homeowners about what to do after being notified and she can hear the anger/sadness in their voices about the whole situation. She hates being involved in that business and wants a different job, but it pays the bills for now.I had to leave my garden gnome behind when I lost my job/house.  I'd chained him to a yard of concrete buried under him so the kids would stop stealing him.  Losing the house had never entered my mind when I did that.  I do miss that little place - I put a lot of love/work in to it - as do most homeowners.  New owner is really liking the place tho so that always makes me feel better.Can someone tell me what happens to the all the equity the original homeowners gained from paying a mortgage for 19 years?[deleted][deleted]I've been renting the same house for 4 years. My landlord hasn't paid it since 2008. 

Funny thing is, I'm struggling to get approved for a loan in order to purchase it, even though my payments (insurance, taxes, etc. included) would be almost $200 less than my actual rent. I've never been late on any payments. It's amazing.That's a tough one. 

It just goes to show; everyone--**everyone** is subject to the whims of fate and we should do our best to soften the blows when and where we can.

Edit: thank you for the gold, stranger.Lots of good comments in here, but some judgment from folks who may not quite understand just how serious the housing crisis, and subsequent recession in 07-08 was. 

My folks lost their home in 2008. I assure you they were both hardworking individuals, but when the shit hit the fan in the USA their jobs cut back, and back....and back. Until eventually the income that allowed them their house in the first place absolutely fell out from under their feet. 

It's important to realize that the emotional impact of losing one's home, a material represenation and reward for all one's hard work, is absolutely devastating. 

I won't elaborate much more other then to say that they are doing just fine nowadays - we all came together, we found a way, and my folks found themselves back in a house once the housing and job market stabilized a bit. 

It was a tough lesson in life for me, because I was just entering college at the time (which I subsequently had to leave at that time due to not being able to afford to attend). But it was an important lesson, and it made me so absolutely grateful for everything I have, no matter how trivial it may be, because at any given time it could all be taken away. 

If you think you are immune from losing it all, I unfortunately have to assure you that you are not. A friend of a friend does the same thing.  Said he's seen a few sorry notes where door molding used to be as people take the molding where they've been marking their kids heights over the years.ITT: a bunch of assholes born on third base telling everyone else they should hit a triple.While I understand the circumstances, I don't understand how someone can kindly leave a note like this without being bitter. The foreclosure process doesn't make sense to me. My girlfriends neighbor lives in a huge house and is an unemployed alcoholic who got divorced and had her kids taken away from her. She stopped paying her mortgage, taxes, electricity and other bills for almost 3 years but was never kicked out. Eventually she some how was able to work things out with the bank or what not because her house is no longer foreclosed on. A friend on the other hand was specifically told by the bank that they have to stop paying their mortgage before they can receive an consideration for assistance from the bank. Within six months they were kicked out and lost the house. Can anyone chime in on that?I'm glad you were there to tell the tale instead of it going into the garbage and being forgotten.  I used to do this too. I remember going to some of these places and the former owners left everything they had there. It was like walking through Chernobyl. They just packed up the essentials and left. Very depressing. I know how you feel.In 2009, I bought a house that had been foreclosed by the bank. The prior owners left no such note. Instead, they pissed all over the house. Luckily, the urine warped the hardwood under the carpet and it looked and smelled really bad, so the value of the house dropped into my price range. After the sale went through, it was very inexpensive to fix the smell and to bleach & carpet the warped hardwood. Thanks, disgruntled prior owners!

edit: 2006 sale price: $550,000. 2009 sale price (after market decline & piss): $225,000.As someone who just lost their job, girlfriend, dog,  was evicted last week,  this hits home.  Good luck to all of us. As someone who is getting ready to close on their very first house this makes me nervous and sick to my stomach. [deleted]And that one penny.This is why taking 30 years to pay off a property is nuts. Drive a cash car, live below your means, listen to Dave Ramsey for motivation and knock that mortgage the fuck out.>P.S. Sorry about the copper pipes.I do the same work, but sometimes I have to be there when they're evicted. That really sucks.

""I don't have very much time these days so I'll make it quick. Like my life. You know, as we come to the end of this phase of our life, we find ourselves trying to remember the good times and trying to forget the bad times, and we find ourselves thinking about the future. We start to worry , thinking, ""What am I gonna do? Where am I gonna be in ten years?"" But I say to you, ""Hey, look at me!"" Please, don't worry so much. Because in the end, none of us have very long on this Earth. Life is fleeting. And if you're ever distressed, cast your eyes to the summer sky when the stars are strung across the velvety night. And when a shooting star streaks through the blackness, turning night into day... make a wish and think of me. Make your life spectacular. I know I did.""""From the Parrot to the Genie #RIPRobinWilliams "" Gilbert Gottfried's twitter reaction to his passing.

Wherever he is I hope the Persian rugs don't give him too much trouble.

R.I.P.which disney page?I wish he could see just how many people cared about him.What the fuck. I cannot believe I am this sad over his death. I've never really mourned the death of a celebrity so I'm shocked at my deep sadness over this. I think the best quote I read was actually from Obama. 

>""Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.  He made us laugh.  He made us cry.  He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets.""I'm still really sad about this. The genie's final wish was freedom. I hope he got what he wanted.""To die would be an awfully grand adventure""- Peter Pan (Hook)

Rest easy Robin Williams. Everyone on reddit is hoping you've finally found your peace.Up until now I've never even felt remotely sad about a celebrity death. Growing up I loved Robin and would watch his movies on repeat almost exclusively. I got bullied a lot in school and watching his movies would always cheer me up. I can't explain why but I always felt a connection with him, like he was my friend. RIP Robin, I'll miss you :.(RIP Robin Williams, you made us laugh but we never saw your pain :( In many ways Robin was the genie.  He was trapped to entertain.  He granted our most rad highs, and was there in heart when achieving our dreams.  To us he was mystical, but to him, he was stuck.  Let's make our last wish for him to R.I.P.

The morning following that stirring historic night, a teenager named John Robinson found a tea chest buried slightly in the sand near the shore and took it home as a souvenir. He kept the chest throughout his childhood and it was subsequently passed down from generation to generation. The Robinson Half Chest is now a part of the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum and serves as an inspiring reminder of the patriotism of that fateful night and the birth of America’s independence. - See more at:

x-post /r/ArtefactPornDoes anyone else reeeeeally want to throw that in the harbor?Looks like one of those boxes where you press certain things and then it opens to reveal a dragon egg or some really weird porn or something.  I think this is actually the cube from the transformers movie.Looks like Nic Cage has found his next target. I'm thinking that looks too much like [a Hellraiser cube](http://i.imgur.com/5kcYiMD.jpg) for my comfort.

*We have such tea to show you...*Dammit, Connor. You had ONE job.
Seems like a really strange way to display a crate. Before time began, there was the Cube. We know not where it comes from, only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life. That is how our race was born. For a time, we lived in harmony. But like all great power, some wanted it for good, others for evil. And so began the war. A war that ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death, and the Cube was lost to the far reaches of space. We scattered across the galaxy, hoping to find it and rebuild our home. Searching every star, every world. And just when all hope seemed lost, message of a new discovery drew us to an unknown planet called... Earth. How big is the crate?They don't allow photos in there...hahaLooks like a Crash Bandicoot crate.I wish to drink it.prob the coolest thing ive seen all day - history buffThat is property of the crown and should be returned![What is your pleasure?](http://brittawrites.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/hellraiser-box.gif?w=529)Isn't Thanos after that?Twelve Men's Morris board carved in the wood... that's neatTwo days late, but there are a couple of people lurking around this thread who work at the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum now because this posting got passed around our staff. I'm an interpreter at the museum. If you have any questions about the chest or the destruction of the tea, feel free to ask! I'm off work today, so I'll check back throughout the day. I should probably also mention that I'm posting all this of my own volition and not on behalf of the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum or Historic Tours of America.

Come visit us if you're ever in Boston! But for now, make sure you check out our website: http://www.bostonteapartyship.com/

Also- if you want to watch us destroy some tea, make sure you check out our webcams! We have one looking out on each of our ships (The Brig Beaver and the Eleanor) Sometimes you just see colonists hauling tea back up (Don't worry the irony is not lost on us) but every fifteen minutes or so, you can catch a riot in progress :)- http://www.bostonteapartyship.com/boston-webcam

And lastly, we have a reenactment of the Boston Tea Party every December 16th. We start off with the meeting of the Body of the People in Old South Meeting House, then led by fife and drum corps we march down to the harborwalk where Griffin's Wharf used to stand while colonists board the ships and dump chests of East India Company tea into the sea. Our reenactment is funded through a separate organization called December 16th 1773, whose website is right here: http://www.december16.org/ or if you are feeling generous and would like to contribute to the reenactment, we have an indiegogo campaign set up here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/241st-anniversary-of-the-boston-tea-party-reenactment#home

A couple of supplementary things you might find interesting:
- As the OP stated, 340 chests of tea were thrown over the sides of the three ships that night (The Eleanor, The Dartmouth and the Beaver).Those 340 chests consisted of 240 chests of Bohea, 60 chests of Singlo, 15 chests of Congou, 15 chests of Hyson, and 10 chests of Souchong. Bohea, Congou and Souchong were all black teas. Hyson and Singlo where both green- Hyson was often consumed by some of the wealthier upperclass women, but this was the first shipment of Singlo to arrive in Boston so it ended up making its Boston debut a little later than planned because we dumped it all into the sea. Whomp whomp.

-The Robinson Half Chest has been tested by forensic scientists and found to contain traces of tea, led, saltwater and particles consistent with the things the Robinson family stored inside it. We're not really sure how that game board got on the board, but there is speculation sailors carved it into the chest on the crossing over from London. There are flowers on the side that were painted on later by the Robinson family, who used it to store dolls, toys, school supplies and apparently even a litter of kittens.

-Many other chests that were found shortly after the destruction were evidently very intentionally destroyed. For example, John Rowe, the owner of the Eleanor has this entry in his journal for December 31st regarding a half chest of tea found in a man named Withington's house in Dorchester shortly after the destruction and a group of people in Charlestown who find tea and burn it:
""Dec. 31. — The people of Charlestowu collected what tea they could 
find in the town and burnt it in tlie view of a thousand spectators. There was found in the house of one Withington of Dorchester about half a chest of tea ; the people gathered together and took the tea, brought it into the Common of Boston, and burnt it this night about eleven of clock. This is supposed to be part of the tea that was taken out of the ships and floated over to Dorchester.""

Full text of John Rowe's diary is available here (worth a read!): http://archive.org/stream/diaryofjohnrowe00pier/diaryofjohnrowe00pier_djvu.txt

-Everyone did take an oath of secrecy not to reveal the identities of those involved, but later in the 1830s public interest in the events leading up to the revolution would be revived and some participants started to tell their stories. You can read George Robert Twelves Hewes' memories of it here: http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/revolution/teaparty.htm

Again- if you have questions I would love to answer them! Huzzah.

Fun fact: That hole cut out of the circular wall would have been a toilet. Back then they just dropped trou out in the open at the baths. 

At least that's what my Greek buddy told me...These are all over Athens. Pretty much if you buy property in Greece pray to God you dont find anything ancient before building on top of it because then its going to take several years before the excavate the whole place.

Building the Metro/Underground/tube was exceptionally hard because of too many artifacts.

I was interviewed on a Greek news program about whether the British museum should return the artifacts they took now that Athens has a proper place.
Obviously I agreed with the crowd of Greeks.This is gonna confuse the hell out of archaeologists 1000 years from now.My vacation to Greece was easily the most fun I've ever had in my life, it was incredible. I recommend going to a few islands as well, they're all amazing and they're all unique. I remember everyone tossing coins down there, it was crazy how many there were down there.I didn't get to go to any museums when I was in Athens, I was so disappointed. Bloody Contiki.

A few other friends of mine ended up being in the picture. One of my friends that was originally not supposed to be in the picture died last year. It is now one of my favorite pictures. Works better with an iPhone, it automatically takes the picture when it detects the person is in view and at optimal hight. Try it out...... I'd probably end up with a broken GoPro if I tried this.

* Susannah Mushatt-Jones, F, Born 6 July 1899, American

* Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, F, Born 29 November 1899, ItalianThe last six individuals that complain about people saying they're 1900s kids. How badass would it be to be able to say your life has spanned across three centuries? This is awesome. My great grandmother was born in 1898. She passed away in 2007. She told us stories about moving states on a covered wagon. She also told us how she would run to town to watch the cars drive around. She was full of awesome stories. You just didn't play poker with her. She always cheated.So, these people were ~4 years old for the first legit airplane flight, ~15-19 years old for WWI (possibly a reason why we don't see many men this age), ~30 years old for the first stock market crash, ~40 years old for WWII, ~70 years old for the moon landing, ~97 years old when Dolly was cloned, and are still walking around seeing 3D printing and smart phones and whatnot?

No wonder old people seem to never quite know what's going on. Shit's overwhelming to even think about.[""What about me?""](http://imgur.com/tv10LWc)So what we can conclude from this is that everyone born in the 1800s was old as hell.Wow. Black really don't crack.Wow man,  the Spice Girls have really let themselves go... That's cos men get nagged into early graves, amirite fellas?!

But seriously, the lower life expectency of males is not a joking matter. I take this opportunity to raise awareness of mens' health, go see your doctor regularly gents. Remember ""a finger in the bum, a long life of fun""If that's #3's happy face, she can probably melt stone and make sinners repent with her disappointed face.what would be kind of cool is a graph showing the number of people born in the 1800s by year.

also, a year ago there were 17, and 16 of them were female

http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/14bgwv/til_that_there_are_17_people_alive_that_were_born/So when is the final battle in the arena?Actually there's a brazilian man that through some researches about his past they discovered that he was born in 1889, one year after the end of slavery in Brazil!And now the retirement home where he lives is trying to collect money to pay a test to have sure he is that old.
Ps:sorry for possible english mistakes, not main language.That second lady looks pretty good for her age. Imagine: Every single person that was alive when these six were born has died. It's so crazy. Just consider all the technological and scientific progress these women have seen.

He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty. Pain is easy to portray but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world.

It is basically a combination homestead and barn.  The buildings around the edges are mostly houses for each of the patriarch's wives, children, and in some cases younger siblings.  The buildings are constructed out of cow manure and grass.  The center is a pen where the livestock are kept at night to protect them from predators and theft.  During the day the cattle will be taken out to graze, as is shown in this picture.  The borders are living thorny hedges which they have cultivated into that shape.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Francisco_(SSN-711)#Collision_with_seamount> In June 2006, it was announced that San Francisco’s bow section would need to be replaced with that of the soon-to-be-retired USS Honolulu (SSN-718) at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Though San Francisco is four years older than Honolulu, she had been refueled and upgraded in 2000–2002. The cost of her bow replacement has been estimated at $79 million, as compared with the estimated $170 million to refuel and overhaul the nuclear reactor of Honolulu.[6]

>On 10 October 2008, San Francisco undocked after a successful bow replacement at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The dry-docking project involved cutting more than one million pounds of forward ballast tanks and sonar sphere off the former USS Honolulu and attaching them to San Francisco.

That's insane. The sailor's name who perished was Joe Ashley and he was from my home town.  He graduated a few years ahead of me but I still knew him when he would visit for Alumni Band night and random visits to the high school Manchester High School) and our Boy Scout Troop 118.  He was the guy who taught me my first cadence and also my first rather ""blue"" squad cheer.  You always knew when Joe was home because he drove a black Jeep Wrangler with the General Lee's distinctive horn.  The best is when he'd blast that right out in front of the high school in the middle of the day.  No one was ever upset by it because he was a hometown hero.

http://www.usssanfrancisco.org/Joseph%20Allen%20Ashley.html
I was in subschool when this happened. It was not a good deal and is amazing that only one person died. That COB was a hero for harping so hard on stow for sea, and after this no one complained about having to checking everything to make sure it is stowed for sea.

Also, the San Fran had just refueled the reactor right before this happened, so instead of decommissioning the San Fran, the Navy decomed the USS Honolulu, chopped off the front end of it and used it on the San Fran. Therefore, the USS San Francisco is referred as the Gay Pineapple around the sub fleet.

Blood was everywhere. Sailors lay sprawled across the floor, several of them unconscious, others simply dazed. Even the captain was asking, ""What just happened?"" All anyone knew for sure was that the nuclear-powered attack submarine had slammed head-on into something solid and very large, and that it had to get to the surface fast.

In the control room, a senior enlisted man shoved the ""chicken switches,"" blowing high-pressure air through the ballast tanks to force the vessel upward. Usually, the submarine would respond at once. But as the captain, Cmdr. Kevin G. Mooney, and top officers stared at the depth gauge, the needle refused to budge.

Moments before, they had been slipping quiet and fast through the Pacific. Now, they were stuck, more than 500 feet down.

Ten seconds passed. Then 20, 30.

""I thought I was going to die,"" Commander Mooney recalled.

It would be close to a minute, but an excruciatingly long minute, before the submarine's mangled nose began to rise, before the entire control room exhaled in relief, before the diving officer, Chief Petty Officer Danny R. Hager, began to read out a succession of shallower depths.

""I don't know how long it was,"" Chief Hager said, ""but it seemed like forever.""

Last week, Navy investigators reported that a series of mistakes at sea and onshore caused the 6,900-ton submarine, the San Francisco, to run into an undersea mountain not on its navigational charts. One crewman was killed, 98 others were injured, and the captain and three other officers were relieved of their duties as a result of the Jan. 8 crash, one of the worst on an American submarine since the 1960's.

But what is becoming clear only now, from the first interviews with Commander Mooney and 15 other officers and enlisted men, as well as a review of Navy reports, is how much worse it nearly was, and how close the San Francisco came to being lost.

The submarine crashed at top speed - 33 knots, or roughly 38 miles an hour - about 360 miles southeast of Guam. The impact punched huge holes in the forward ballast tanks, so the air being blown into them was no match for the ocean pouring in. The throttles shut, and the vessel briefly lost propulsion. As the emergency blow caught hold, mainly in the rear tanks, the sub was just drifting in the deep, its bow pointing down.

Luckily, the thick inner hull protecting the nuclear reactor and the crew's quarters held. But within was pandemonium - bodies pinballing, heads striking steel in the warren of lethally sharp surfaces in impossibly tight spaces. There was so much blood on the instruments and on the control-room floor that the place, Chief Hager said, ""looked like a slaughterhouse.""

Then chaos gave way to improvised heroism and a perilous, and finally futile, effort to rescue the most grievously injured sailor.


May 18, 2005
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/18/national/18crash.html?pagewanted=allI bet that guy got fired.This was one of the worst days in my life. Seeing this pop up on my feed made my tummy flip flop. Getting the call that your husband has been hurt is just awful. He ended up with a traumatic brain injury that changed our lives. Ashley was an awesome sailor and our friend. This was a tragic day, but could have been so much worse. I am very thankful that more lives were not lost.  Captain mooney was also a good leader and gave me away at our wedding. I can't believe that they actually fixed this sub and now it's back out in the water. Honestly I guess I was surprised to see it because most people don't even know this happened.Someone is going to have to mop a lot of rainy days.
EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger. Makes me feel a lil better for the rainy days that i mopped. They really need to put windows in them things. When I worked for General Dynamics we had to do repairs on a sub that had tried to resurface directly under a container ship. The entire sail was bent at about a 30 degree angle. Dont think anyone was hurt though. If i remember correctly this was back in 2008My unexpected first thought: Where in the world do they get tarps that are that big?why is such machinery always painted green on the inside?I was stationed with those guys.  That was my sister ship.  We were the first fast attack to change to Guam as a homeport, the San Fran was the second.  A tiny little island, a tiny Military presence, and most of that was Air Force.  I remember exactly where I was on the island when we found out.  Watching them limp back into port was brutal.  Even worse was going to the memorial.  

This was a testament to the intense training submariners go through.  Reacting they way they did saved countless lives.

Sadly, this was the navigation departments fault.  I was also in the navigation department on my boat, and we would swap charts and everything else with their navigation division all the time.  One of my best friends from Submarine School was in that very division, and was in fact the on-watch QMOW at the time.  Still tough looking at this years later, and although they reacted promptly and saved lives, the seamount in question was not properly annotated on the charts, meaning this entire thing could have been avoided.

I was in the Navy when this happened and I couldnt understand how something like this happened. Actually, I still feel that way. I recall negligence being the cause of this IIRCEarth: 1That'll polish right out.Well sure, if you leave a blue tarp over the front, you can't see where you're going!  #polishnavyMountain known as Godzilla's mouth I was in the shipyard right after this happened and got to go and take a close look at it. She was one dock over from the uss parche, which was even more incredible to look at.You think the carpet pissers did this,  Dude?This is what happens when you drink and dive.How many points did he get docked against his sub driver's license?

I was in the helicopter squadron that pulled all those dudes out of the sub. It was a pretty intense scene.

That big ass white ship next to it was the USS Frank Cable a sub-tender.Boop.It kills me to see people make jokes about this. As a guy who serves on a submarine now the thought of this happening scares the shit out of me.

The place is awesome - watching them feed the baby elephants was one of the highlights of my trip.I was just there on Saturday.  I'm an American, currently living in western Kenya.  This is one of the best spots in Kenya for sure.  If you adopt an elephant for $50, you can arrange a private visit with your elephant and come in the evening to tuck it in to bed.  Also, the current owner, Daphne Sheldrick wrote an incredible book full of stories about rescuing and housing wild animals in Kenya.  It's worth a read.Africa is full of scams about orphanages, volunteering, etc.  I'd say over 95% of 'volunteer' opportunities are just exploiting the locals or local area to make gobs of money off of foreigners.  However, the [David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust](http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/), where this photo is taken, is not one of those.  They do amazing work and are ethically managed.  They truly are a diamond in the rough.The sad part is this is also a place for diseased elephants too (65% of the elephants there are quarantined for having illnesses). They are kept in a reserve the size of 2 square miles so they have room to roam around and feel like they are in the wild. The most common of illnesses is West Nile because of the over abundance of mosquitoes in the country.Are they hiring?I love [this one](https://i.imgur.com/6oFSxEz.jpg) from the Virunga National Park, home to one of the last remaining populations of mountain gorillasAt first I read ""Elephant Orange"", that title also makes senseI've also been there! At one point they brought out a baby rhinoceros too. I was in Kenya on a trip to visit the Masai but we spent a few days in Nairobi first, this was definitely the highlight of my time in Nairobi. I just watched a PBS documentary about this orphanage.  It was equal parts heartbreaking and heartwarming. Here's the link: http://video.pbs.org/video/2365284372/The happiness on that mans face... He clearly loves what he's doing. I envy that so much. This is awesome.There are so many of them.../r/babyelephantgifsI too have been [here](http://i.imgur.com/UsEWXW5.jpg). When I visited, there were at least 3 different school classes there. They do a great job of trying to educate the kids about the animals.

Eventually he perched on my finger and drank from the spoon.  He sat on my finger for a good fifteen minutes and then buzzed off.  

But the coolest part was that he came back to me all summer!  I would go outside holding a teaspoon of food and extend my index finger and he would fly in and sit on my finger and eat.   :-).   He was a bit small most of the summer, and this allowed him to get food without competition from the other hummingbirds around the feeder.  

I sure missed him when he left too grate away.  He was as big as the others by then.  I hope he had a great Birdy life.The original inspiration for sequins. I love hummingbirds.  Great shot.How was that lil' guy caught??  Hurt maybe?

They went from the Misfits, the Outcasts, the Exiles, and the Spiders all within 50 or so years of existence.. When a new owner took over in 1914 he had the Cleveland newspaper run a local team naming contest and Cleveland Indians was selected as a tribute to Louis Sockalexis, a Native American who had past away the previous year who was a legendary Cleveland baseball player.  Obviously in today's day-in-age the name has racist connotations, however at the time of the naming it was actually a tribute to one of the leagues first Native American baseball players. Cleveland has taken steps to move away from Chief Wahoo.. the logo you see on the shirts above and the local fan club no longer uses the term Wahoo's Tipi. The name, like the Redskins, and Braves will probably be changed in time for political correctness... but it would be nice if people actually did some research behind the names because a lot of them have some pretty interesting historical background.

No, no, no...  You need to wait until April Fools' Day to do this.

I did this a few years back, as we had primarily HP's in our organization.  I built a simple script to set the ""Ready"" message on all the network printers in the organization (a few dozen) to ""Out of Cheese."" as of 8am on April 1 (to avoid calls by evening staff, who are easily spooked).

It was important to pick something ridiculous enough that the [PEBKAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error)-types wouldn't take it seriously.

We do our ""traditional barbecue"" on these by putting a grill that hangs from a tripod on it, and we call it ""schwenken"" (swinging, because the grill swings around to equalize heat distribution). All these washer tub grills are probably quite a few years old because every household here has them since their great-grandfathers or someone deconstructed an old washer.

We double stack those and bolt them to some metal rods. The wood ash falls right out of the lower drum for easy cleanup.

Looks great when they glow from the intense heat.I wouldn't even be able to tell it was a washer tub unless you told me!My old man welded some legs on old 18 wheeler steel wheels, just cover up the hole in the bottom and they make great fire places.

He also made a couple fire places out of well pump ballast tanks, just cutting the side out and welding wire screens in their place.  I wish I had a picture.  I mean, yeah, it's kind of ghetto but they make good fire places so fuck it.hope that thing isn't painted in some toxic waterproof paint.

There is NO CHANCE OP's boyfriend came back from an oil-field with a perfect, museum quality, polished and cleaned trilobite. Trilobites are generally *much* older than most fossil fuels - trilobites are between 300 and 600 million years old. 

Also, not to get scientific, but the process that results in fossil fuels is the exact opposite as that which results in fossils. 

So, simply put: OP is a liar. Or her boyfriend is a liar.

Or they have a fossil store on the way home from the oil field.

[edit] not a geologist - just a fossil-loving nerd.
[edit 2] Further evidence: some trilobites come out of sedimentary rock, so you can expose them by splitting the rock on the right layer. But others (like this trilobite) are in much harder rock, and they need to be chiseled out and scraped away. Any by museum quality - obviously, museum quality would be much better - you would be able to see the detail of the eyes (which look like tiny nodules on their round eyes). but this is a quality trilobite, not one that you would find, in that condition, on the ground. that's called a kabuto, I think there's a lab that will revive it for youTrilo-tastic.Daww its sooo cute :3","{'Sadness': 0.043796, 'Emotional_Range': 0.795, 'Tentative': 0.49, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.049054, 'Analytical': 0.124, 'Conscientiousness': 0.051, 'Agreeableness': 0.448, 'Joy': 0.05414, 'Disgust': 0.492349, 'Extraversion': 0.599, 'Openness': 0.368, 'Anger': 0.793542}","{'animal': 0.710949, 'mammal': 0.377541}"

Most miners make just enough to live a basic lifestyle, meaning they live on their claim with no running water, sewerage or town power. A few do very well out of it though. I did a tour in Lightning Ridge and they said that the most successful miner was some guy that lived his whole life in the mines. It was estimated he made about $80m in todays money.

After mating at sea, adult female sea pianos return to land to nest. Different species of sea pianos exhibit various levels of philopatry. In the extreme case, females return to the beach where they hatched. This can take place every two to four years in maturity. They make from one to eight nests per season. The mature nesting female hauls herself onto the beach and finds suitable sand on which to create a nest. Using her hind legs, she digs a circular hole 40 to 50 centimetres (16 to 20 in) deep. After the hole is dug, the female then starts filling the nest with a clutch of soft-shelled eggs one by one until she has deposited around 50 to 200 eggs, depending on the species. Some species have been reported to lay 250 eggs, such as the grand piano. After laying, she re-fills the nest with sand, re-sculpting and smoothing the surface until it is relatively undetectable visually. The whole process takes thirty to sixty minutes. She then returns to the ocean, leaving the eggs untended.You are an idiot.  What do you think Grand Pianios actually come from?

""Never trust anything that smiles all the time"" - Sir Terry PrattchetTHE LEVIATHAN HAS COMEFun fact that you can see clearly in this picture:
Most marine mammals(save for polar bears and sea otters) have what's known as homodont dentition. As many here have pointed out, there's a lot of sharp pointed teeth in that picture.
This is in contrast with terrestrial mammals where you often see molars, canines, etc. 
Moving to the marine environment generally causes organisms to not only have teeth of the same shape, but more of them. This allows the dolphin to easily grasp it's prey underwater. 
Dolphins have 50-100 conical teeth, while porpoises will have what's known as [spatulate teeth](http://www.thefossilforum.com/uploads/monthly_06_2013/post-2301-0-92947200-1372075036.jpg), and baleen whales will have baleen plates instead of teeth.Whew... now I feel better. 'Course, that might not do any good you see nobody's missing a porpoise. It's a dolphin that's been taken. The common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth and a triangular thoracic fin. While the bottlenose dolphin, or Tursiops truncates, has an elongated beak, round cone shaped teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage. But I'm sure you already knew that.

http://imgur.com/sWEPSVZIt looks colder than that.[deleted]""Painkillers?  You mean bitch mints.""My father was in the Soviet military stationed by the Kremlin in Antarctica around 1961-1963. The U.S. Seabees, as a retaliation, were sent there and stationed right next to them. He told me how he never had a better time in his life than with those guys. The Russians got along so well with the American sailors that they would drink together all the time and switch uniforms in which my father would always say ""you could never tell who was Ivan and who was John"". It was like a different world. A world of peace. He loved those guys. There is kind of a subtly beauty there, representing how we all can get along and just don't care about political differences. As he would say, it's a game only for the politicians, nobody else. This picture made me think of that. Thought I would share.

He has a varidesk.there was one day i went to a friends house to drop in on her; she wasn't home; and we had a history of playing pranks on eachother.. so naturally, i re-arranged all of her patio furniture; then remembered I had a jar of vick's vapor rub (menthol rub stuff) which I then rubbed all over her doorknob...  

of course, later that night i got a pissed off phone call.. the menthol on the doorknob went awesomely for me, she hated it..  Well, also she had just gotten a tattoo on her wrist that day (hence why she was gone), and when she tried to twist the doorknob, her hand went flying off and the vapor rub went allll over her tattoo, and hurt like a bitch.  it was great :)This prank would be significantly better if they had wired everything up and made him work out there for the day.It's more fun to put the hand lotion on the receiver of the phone and then call the co-worker.  :)Varidesk is the thing his monitor is sitting on. You can raise and lower it so you can switch between a sitting and standing desk. I have one at work, it is awesome. Putting a apple sticker on a PC. I'm guessing he is the office douchebag.And then his personables get stolen, the company computer gets stolen, all of the company's personal files are compromised, causing the company to spend thousands of dollars to recover; ultimately resulting in bankruptcy.

What this picture doesn't show is the multiple philanthropic organizations that were invited and set up booths, the live jazz band, the documentary playing on our patio about Cambodian sex trade, the bouncy castle (LM set up out of pocket), and the drawing contest to win free ice cream and other prizes. We sell ice cream by the scoop and can easily measure approximately how much has been scooped (the business donates a scoop of rice/beans to an impoverished area for every scoop we sell- also the rice/beans are bought in the home country of that area for economic balance). I realize this is reddit and you people are shit heads by nature but little man  does a LOT of good for Denver and tries to do good for the world.

Maybe I should return to study because I definitely don't understand all of those big words. How did you get started in this field? I'm really interested in this!It's amazing, almost realistic.  Don't get me wrong, it's fantastic work, but the eyelashes jumped out at me.  Specifically that the lower eyelashes are a series of clumps and not a line, and the upper eyelash has too many rotated lashes.  They're not consistently turned upward along the eye.

Maybe I'm picky.As someone who is married to a guy with an ocular prosthesis (ELI5 for everyone else, hubby's got a ""glass eye""), that's a really nice eye. I know how much work goes into those, it's a really amazing process. When he gets a new one made every few years, if the ocularist allows me watch any of the process (other than the fitting, that skeeves me out for some reason), I hang out as much as I can.

The rest of the implant is really cool too. Definitely an art.Are you making eyes at me?You should post this on /r/somethingimade 

It looks awesome!If only Richard Harrow was still aliveAs a radiation therapist, let me just say how much I respect what you guys do.  It's astounding, and helps patients so much.Do you have a picture of the opposite eye, or what you used for reference? Do do you have to hand paint these or is there some kind of printer you use to make them look photorealistic?[Beats my effort.](http://2.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/58/77/a619a9eecb0cfdf0833d5f7325a134df.jpg)You certainly have an eye for it.

It can be a little traumatic for a 6 year old hahaha. I'm 20 now and I appreciate what an amazing thing she does for people. PS. Halloween at my house gets really nuts with her skills. Even though we can infer what each term means, explain them like we are 5. Hello. Absolutely amazing job! You're very talented.
I have a question: Can you apply and remove make up to these?Now make it blink.nice job.  the big words in the title got me curious to find out what they meantI knew someone who wore a glass eye a long time ago, and this is MUCH better than that! That being said: I adore the colors you achieved in the iris. I wish mine were that striking. The top row of eyelashes doesn't disturb me, because those can be fixed cosmetically, but that lower line definitely needs more  practice--they look like stabbed-in stitches.  I think you have great potential, though, if that is the worst you've done with the first try!This looks incredibly realistic. However, I am sure when this ,or any other prosthetic eye, is used people can always tell that it isn't a real eye. So my question to you is, how do you avoid the ""[Uncanny Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)"". I feel like it might end up being a negative that it is so close to human but just slightly off. I might be wrong though. It could look great.What the ever loving f!. That looks SO realistic.

My job three or four years prior was to sit in between Cuba/Haiti and the US and prevent migrants from entering the United States.  The Cubans were our main concern, because they are legally entitled to become US citizens the moment their feet hit US soil (called the ""Wetfoot/Dryfoot law, enacted by President Clinton).

Every once in a while there is someone onboard and it feels good knowing you and your crew may have saved their life.

This reminds me of a story I heard when I was going through rescue swimmer school back in 2007.  An instructor of mine was telling us his ship put him over the side and into the water to investigate what looked like an unconscious survivor.  Upon coming up to the body and ensuring he wasn't turning over on his own, he turned him over with a boat hook (big 8-9 foot wooden pole with a brass hook) and his body was bloated and decomposing from the seawater.  They had to dispose of the body so when they moved him, he said the body just kind of broke apart.  Pretty sick, and I'm going to stop typing because it still grosses me out.EerieWhat is going on with the half fish on the pole with a rope in the water? Did he string up a shark and use the fish as someone would do with a horse and carrot?  Abandoned? Or haunted?That's definitely not a Cuban raft. It doesn't have a domino table
any square groupers near by/Richard Parker, where did you go?Oh, poor Santiago. Surely, the marlin has not bested you! Living in south fl and being a huge beach bum, I've come across 3 of these washed up. And a drug boat. The creativity in the rafts is pretty impressive. One I found had USCG painted on it. So I assumed the coast guard intersected them and just let the raft go... It's pretty cool to come across them. But my buddy has me beat. He came across a kilo of coke washed up on a pretty vacant beach. Still have my eyes peeled for a square grouper every time I'm out there. Wilson, where are you??,?That's some pretty dammed good engineering right there. Looks like just about every part of that thing came out of the trash heap.

""Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, chief. It was comin' back, from the island of Tinian to Laytee, just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. Huh huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like ol' squares in battle like a, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark comes to the nearest man and that man, he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got...lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces.
Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand. I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, boson's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.""This would occur just before I break the surface tension of my sphincter.Not surface tension, but kinematic viscosity, which is ratio of viscosity to density.  The inertia of the water, and its viscosity, cause the water pushed forward by the nose to take a little time to flow off the nose.  Flow is always attached at the boundaries (called the no-slip boundary condition) and it has to flow away due to inertia and gravity, but the no-slip condition keeps driving the water up for a while until it has a chance to flow away.

I remember the good ole days when a type on a title was a dead-endI flew through Heathrow once and had to stay overnight in a hotel before catching a flight the next day.  While on one of the airport buses to the hotel I realized that I only had dollars - no ha'pennys or thrupences or farthings, or whatever.  I was tired as all hell and just needed sleep. So I gave the driver a $20 and told him he was welcome to whatever was left over.  

The next day when I checked out, the desk clerk handed me an envelope with my change from the $20.  The bus driver had not only dropped it off after his shift, but asked that they not wake me and just hand it to me when I checked out.

When I flew back through, again tired and lagged I waited in an astoundingly long line to check in for my flight.  So long that without realizing it, I missed my flight.  When I got to the girl at the desk, she hollered at me for being so dumb and not cutting the line.

It was mentioned in a behind the scenes segment (special features) that there were some shot locations in Texas.
Now all I think about when I see posts about Hamilton Pool is amoebic meningitis. Hamilton Pool is sometimes closed during hot days when it hasn't rained in a good while because the bacteria count is too high in the water. Can't help but think its due to these brain eating amoebas.

It was amazing bringing poor kids from Austin somewhere they hadn't even dreamed would exist, let alone within an hour of their homes.

Down the road from Hamilton is Reimer's Ranch, where my friends and I built a 1.2 mile, wheelchari-accessible scenic trail overlooking the Pedernales. http://i.imgur.com/95pC6.jpg

I also have to plug Westcave Preserve, which is a similar, BEAUTIFUL collapsed limestone grotto just across the Pedernales river from Hamilton. They offer tours most days of the week led by my friend who's been there 7 years, and have an amazing building as their learning center that's built around the wonder of science: it has an [analemma](http://mtroyce.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/analemma.jpg) laid into the floor, where the sun will fall at noon of each day over the course of a year.

Been in Austin like 4 years and just realize Hamilton is like 20 min from me. It was used in the filming of predators as well. That's how I first learned about this awesome place :)Posted this before, but might be useful to some:

If you are going to go, make sure you get there at least thirty minutes before they open the gates and preferably not on a Saturday unless you don't mind waiting a while. They only allow so many people in at a time (which is actually pretty nice). It's a good hike down to the location, so wear something suitable on your feet.
Also, they have a hotline that you'll want to call before going to confirm that they will be open that day. Due to water conditions, rain, etc. they may close.I was just there two days ago. It's a beautiful place, too bad the bacteria levels have been too high for swimming recently.This is where my (now) husband proposed to me. It's a pretty magical place. :)Looks like the Isle of Besaid.Just drove to Austin from Canada last month.  I had never been anywhere in the United States before. The food was so fucking good. 10/10 would visit again.

They will be released in 11 years when reaching 18.Teamwork makes the dream workI don't see TJ anywhere.And then the door opened inward.I lived in southern Illinois and we couldn't go outside for recess if there was snow like that on ground :(
We had to go in the boring gym.Is that you in the photo, OP??  Given the age of the photo...Plot twist: A gang of middle-aged dwarfs lay siege to the local school to set an example.Zero Tolerance activated. All children were expelled. Oh man, back in elementary school I got the bright idea during inside recess with no teacher around that if we colored in the entire chalk board with chalk it would take forever to erase and we wouldn't have class the rest of the day.  We got the job done and when the teacher walked in I was immediately pointed to as the instigator. This is the only time I ever remember getting in trouble in elementary school.  Now high school is another matter all together...In my elementary school during recess one day most of the class revolted and we barricaded ourselves into the playground equipment. There were 3/4 defectors, but they ended up staying outside anyway because the teachers couldn't go in. This lasted a few hours until 2 of the kids broke out into a fight and the rest of us took down the walls to let a teacher in, because it looked like one of them was getting beaten pretty badly.

In hindsight, we should have just tossed them outside and continued the protest. That event made us lose a lot of credibility in terms of not needing adults to govern us.Headline: 30 teachers killed in horrific fire, ironically trapped within the burning building by a wall of compact snow.Is it just me, or does that look like Carter leading the pack?Source - https://secure.flickr.com/photos/milov/5831154/


**Day 40:** We're down to our last twinkies. Still no sign of any life inside. We fear they may be dead. We will soon need to go back inside for lunchtime.Ahh, reminds me of the old [Snowball Rebellion of 1848](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Delta_Theta#History).This looks like the outside of the school from ""Recess""I remember in pre school (3 or 4 years old), me and a friend were digging a whole under the fence to escape. We did this in our dorm to prank a foreign exchange student who'd never seen snow.  Only we filled just the windows on the common room, his room, and all ground floor exits (had windows high up in doors).  Then we had people outside holding all the doors against our best efforts to open them.  Since he had to miss breakfast we shared our ""supplies for the week"" with him (cup of ramen) and said we'd need to ration everything.  Five minutes before his math exam we told him the truth and sent him running there with his pajama shirt under his jacket.

How completely and utterly boring!""There might be some people out there who don't know much about Rik and when checking his videos may find him a bit over the top or obnoxious, and I admit sometimes when revisiting his comedy I do find him a bit too much sometimes.

However it's important to remember the context of his humour and when he became famous. Before The Young Ones there was nothing quite like it on British TV. We had a bunch on genteel sitcoms and then there was this crazy punk anarchy comic shouting in peoples faces and being rude. Without Rik and the other comedians of his generation English tv may well be full of bland pretty face comedies, we have a lot to thank him for.

I have so many great memories of seeing Rik on TV in my youth, here he is at his charismatic best as Lord Flashheart in Black Adder Goes Forth (watch out for House and Mr. Bean too if thats your thing)

It blows my mind that something that has adapted to live in the ocean has figured out how to break the barriers of their domain and takes flight. 

EDIT: People of Reddit; stop being so literal all the time. One night while fishing in our boat for squid I witnessed something unusual and that I'd never seen before. The standard squid we catch here were doing just this and jumping out of the water at our lures (which were lighted with glow sticks). Some of the smaller squid seemed to get good air too and clear the water by 8 inches to a foot. We actually held our lures just over the rails of our boat and some of them jumped straight into the boat or onto the rail.

Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.*TIL: Squids can fly

Maybe someday my grandkids will find them and be shocked by them.Chattanooga! Yeah!my step father has a jar of horse shit collected  by his grand father the day titanic sank. any questions you have about why he would do that will remain unanswered because we have no fucking clue.Best 2 cents your family ever spent.

And I love the name ""[Major Archibald Butt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Butt)"", but it is sad that he appears to not have survived the tragedy. 

>Butt's actions while the ship sank are largely unverified, but many accounts of a typically sensationalist nature were published by newspapers after the disaster. One account had the ship's captain, Edward J. Smith, telling Butt that the ship was doomed, after which Butt began to act like a ship's officer and supervised the loading and lowering of lifeboats.[33] The New York Times also claimed that Butt herded women and children into lifeboats.[34] Another account said that Butt, a gun in his hand, prevented panicked male passengers from storming the lifeboats.[35] Yet another version of events said Butt yanked a man out of one of the lifeboats so that a woman could board. In this story, Butt declared, ""Sorry, women will be attended to first or I'll break every damned bone in your body!""[35] One account tells of Butt preventing desperate steerage passengers from breaking into the first class areas in a desperate attempt to escape the sinking ship.[35] Walter Lord's book A Night to Remember disagrees with claims that Butt acted like an officer. Lord says Butt most likely quietly observed the ship's evacuation.[36] Many newspapers repeated a story allegedly told by Marie Young. This tale says that Butt helped her into Lifeboat No. 8, tucked a blanket about her, and said, ""Goodbye, Miss Young. Luck is with you. Will you kindly remember me to all the folks back home?"" Young later wrote to President Taft denying she ever told such a story.[37]

>Even Butt's final moments remain in dispute. Dr. Washington Dodge says he saw John Jacob Astor and Butt standing near the bridge as the ship went down.[38] (Dodge's account is highly unlikely, as his lifeboat was more than 0.5 miles (0.80 km) away from the ship at the time it sank.)[39] Other eyewitnesses say they saw him standing calmly on deck[40] or standing side-by-side with Astor waving goodbye.[41] Several accounts had Butt returning to the smoking room, where he stood quietly or resumed his card game.[42] But these accounts have been disputed by author John Maxtone-Graham[43] and Titanic's steward John Stewart.[44][45][46][47]That sir is recyclable.I'll give ya $5.00 cash money for it :-)""Captain J.

I've often wondered if I'd have the courage to do that.Not the best pictures (or the best preservation technique) but I've got a [paper](http://imgur.com/a/mDTnL) from confederation day in Canada.

868 still seems like a lotAnyone here notice how the news back then focuses on how many survived instead of how many died..I'm no Antique Road Show, but I would say that's worth at *least* 2 and a half pants-fulls of money.""Thank you, thank you. Every moment is a journey, and every journey has it's leader: I'm proud to be yours.""   -James CameronImagine how many more would have lived if they didn't follow the ""unwritten laws of the sea.""The two things that stand out for me is that a newspaper cost two cents in 1912. The second is that the unwritten law of the seas was rigorously enforced (women and children first). In the recent ferry disaster, crew members abandoned ship before passengers.Was the titanic and all it's cargo really worth over 12million back then? Geez, how much would it be now with inflation? Rick would says it's a fake. Give it to a museum Anyone know what font is the third row (""OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED PERISH IN TITANIC.."")?

For covers that don't just pop off, there is a slot on the bottom. Insert the key and it will release the coverIf this is your first VW, just wait until you have to put on the spare tire! That's when the fun really begins. 

tip: If you bought your VW used, make sure the tire key is included in the tire changing kit *before* you need it. Trust me. You lose that little piece of metal while you're out some deserted road with a flat tire and you will curse VW for everything it is and has ever been.
Reminds me of when I worked at a GM dealer and the corvette c6 had just come out. Those things don't have door handles per se, just buttons and electronic poppers. Well sure enough some guy got trapped in his car when the battery died and because he didn't RTFM he didn't know about the hidden emergency release cable tucked into the sill. Then I got to thinking, what if someone was in an accident and the car was on fire and lost power? Yes, everyone should RTFM, but what if someone was renting, or borrowing it? What if the driver is killed on impact but the passenger is trapped? Well it was about that time that I realized fancy features like that are actually stupid, just complex for the sake of being complex and actually a really terrible idea. 

Oh, and that hidden key hole is no different.


edit: This explains it all perfectly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLDqmGQU6L0I work for Volkswagen, the salesman should have went over that feature with you when he delivered the car to you. I am sorry that happened, and if you have any questions about your VW feel free to PM me.My salesman made sure to show that to me when I bought the car.What do you do with the alarm. If I try unlocking my car with just the key the alarm sounds off. Would starting the car shut it off?what's really nice is that if you insert your key in there and turn it, all your windows will roll down, or up, at once. awesome little pro tip for those hot summer days when getting in your car sucks because its an oven.

Edit: in response to the comments that this can be done using the key fob, unfortunately with the newer models in many cases this is not possible. I own a 2013 Tiguan and it can't be done.

Edit2: you can also open the drivers door, and press down on the driver door window switch. This will open all the windows and the sunroof at once. This is nice because then you don't have to remove the little piece of plastic that covers the key lock. To be honest, its' not a very well engineered solution, but oh well. At least its a better idea than their current ""check tire"" solution. That truly sucks. More on that later.  **Another Volkswagen Easter Egg**

If you stick the key in and turn to the right (as to lock the car) and hold it in that right position, all lowered windows will go back up.Also, if you're car battery dies/died, and your car is a push-start car (don't need to insert key into ignition), you may not be able to put your car into neutral, or shift in general. There should be a small little hole (might have a little cap covering it, flush with the surface, that needs to be popped out) right above the letters ""P R N D 2 1"", you need to insert something into that, keep it pushed in, and then you should be able to put your car into neutral on a push-start car with a dead battery.I like how people apparently believe the only way a to get into a car is a key fob.  

I've run into this before with a lady in a parking lot at work.  Turned out she was just at the wrong car and her key fob was fine.   Great now the terrorists know.Why isn't there a picture of the [hidden key](http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a49/NewVariant/7260bac3.jpg)?

The same thing happened to me, but because I had already found the hidden key inside the fob, I knew there must be a keyhole somewhere on the door. It took me a while to come to that realization (I initially forgot about the hidden key) but once I did, it was just a matter of prying off that little piece of plastic... Edit: terrible punctuation has been improved somewhat.Did people know about this?

Also, because hiding the keyhole is more aesthetically pleasing. Smooth lines, minimal features. That and hiding the keyhole makes it seem less obvious to a would be thief that they could just break into your lock.THIS ONE LITTLE TRICK!

http://imgur.com/xfKEqGsMan this is totally the beginning of a horror.

See that house in the distance?

A small stone from the meteor will hit that house in 10 seconds. It's too small to notice, but burning hot it will go straight through the roof. The happy couple here won't notice it. Too obsessed with eachother's eyes.

The meteor stone reacts with surroundings. It first reacts to dust. Transforms into ant-like creatures, with 16 legs. Just random universte transformation. They multiply by the second. The house is crawling with black creatures the size of a thumb in a matter of minutes.

Meanwhile the happy couple are holding eachother kissing. The girl's arm itches. She scratches, and doesn't notice how she pushes an ant-like creature with sixteen legs from her arm. It falls.

They kiss. They are hot. They don't notice the sound of tiny insect legs, shuffling about. Tiny sounds in the dark, multiplied by a million.

They notice their feet first. Both think it's grass. But it moves up. She screams first as the feeling ascends her thighs. She panics and screams, and so does he, startled by her reaction. They realize they are surrounded by a black mass. And it's moving.

It happens in a matter of two seconds. He realized time has stopped. He can see his body consisting only of bones. Everything else is gone. Is he dead? 

He wakes up. It was just a dream! :)

He hears a knock on the door. It creeks, opens. A familiar figure enters the room and dances in swing-like motion towards the bed. This is cozy, he thinks, and turns on the dim night lamp. Before that, it was dark outside, still. 

He screams in horror as he sees his soon-to-be-wife. She has sixteen legs. Black, long, thick, muscular, insect like legs, but her face is the same. She hisses at him, smiling with her beautiful teeth at the same time: ""It's time for you to get pregnant...honey"".

I got back to the hotel late in Shanghai and took the elevator up along with my native travel mate from Nanjing. A little girl about 5 or 6 was holding her mothers hand right next to me and I felt just the lightest touch on my hand, I looked down and smiled as she rub a little harder. Her mom looked down at what the little girl was doing and flipped shit. Yanked her arm, switched sides with the girl, reprimanded her, etc. Mom was so embarrassed. All she could say in English was 'sorry' over and over.  I told my partner to tell her it was ok no harm. They both waved at me as we left the elevator. 

I remember talking to a colleague while I was there about what Chinese thought about American black people and she said that on TV one of the most popular show back in the day was reruns of the TV show COPS. I'm thinking, Oh great! But she said that if you have the means to get all the way to China you must be doing pretty well and to be in China on business for 6+ months meant alot of respect and trust by my company. Even she was surprised when she picked me up at the airport because all she had was a bad fax copy of a small picture of me. It was so dark she thought it was useless and ignored it.

I went to two different concerts a week apart.  I was in my 40s. 

Tina Turner. I was the youngest person there. People everywhere were smoking pot and passing joints up and down the aisle, just like they did when we all went to concerts when I was a teenager.   

Korn and Rob Zombie. I was the oldest person there. No one was smoking anything that I could see.  

Fucking old people my age.  They were all so hippie-liberal when they were young and then they squeezed out their precious snowflakes and turned into assholes 10x worse than their parents ever were. And there they were at that Tina Turner concert reliving their glory days while doing everything they can to stop their own kids from ever having the same wild life they did when they were young.  It was pathetic. 
Legalize all drugs so people can stop pretending they're cool. Its funny, Texas really is stuck in the 1950s. Lives on Rambo Lanetrying to find this hebrew scroll I have questioning if prostitution should be legalizedDid anyone else have parents that would just stifle any discussion you were having with them by saying ""this conversation is finished"". You were actually making sense, proposed a logically converse argument to what they were saying, and rather than address your concerns and your points they just say ""THIS CONVERSATION IS FINISHED"".

I feel like every time the subject of marijuana legalization gets brought up, our government just shouts ""this conversation is finished"".And yet tobacco and alcohol are legal. The legality is certainly not based on damage to users and possible health benefits, which makes no sense.Who will we stone when the taboo is gone?  Oh for the good old days when you didn't need a reason, just a rock.  I need to live in Washington.The conversation is a lot further along now than it was then. See Colorado,  California, Washington..I think its because after 45 years, in places where the discussion hasn't changed, neither side of the debate wants to bring honest arguments to the table.  

The anti side still wants you to think its horrendously bad for you, on par with heroin or at the very least, a magical gateway drug that drastically increases your chances of winding up a street junky.  The pro side wants you to think it has absolutely no downsides and is actually somehow *healthy* for you.

Both of these positions are moronic.  In places where attitudes and even laws have changed, I believe, the conversation was more adult leading up to those changes.I don't do drugs.  That said, if it were legal here in Wichita I would try it.Let us enjoy it for fuck sakes, how trivial is it to worry about a plant when we could all die tomorrow.

We celebrated his one year birthday on 6/29/13.  Died two days later of ligature strangulation from sleeping in a car seat at the babysitters.

CPS promised the babysitter ""would go away forever.""  I don't see the point.  My wife and I both let both of our sons sleep in car seats (if they fell asleep en route somewhere, obviously not long term) and the coroner said it probably took about 4 minutes and was completely silent, so it's unlikely the baby monitor even broadcast anything out of the norm.  Obviously if I had to do it over again, I would restrict him from sleeping in car seat, but he could have died under our watch just as easily.  Or any of my relatives.  We all have left him asleep in his car seat for four minutes.  It was a one in a million chance and my son paid for it.  I still send my other son to the same babysitter and invited her to the funeral.  It really pisses me off CPS came off like that, but my wife and I are the only ones apparently.  I understand and am totally fine with trying to find someone or something to blame, but she did nothing that the vast majority of people wouldn't do.  The rest of our family (mostly hers) disagrees and blames us for not caring.

That said, it doesn't make me feel any less guilty.  I could have switched him over to his big boy car seat we already had, but I thought he was a little small, so I just adjusted the straps so he'd have one inch off his chest in his rear facing.  I obviously must have done something wrong.  I am a failure as a parent, and my wife got her tubes tied after Clinton was born.  I don't really want another child, to be honest I don't think I'm a fit parent as is, but for some reason it just feels depressing.

In movies and books you see the parents break down and sob and scream and cry.  My wife and I certainly sobbed and cried, but we didn't break down.  That happens a lot more slowly.  At first you're sure you did everything you could, but then one week you start wondering.  And pretty soon you're sure you could have done something.  So you start retracing your steps and examining every action.  Then your mind starts tricking you into thinking you never spent any time with him, instead preferring his brother.  Then you start wondering about all of the days he was sick and you didn't take off work to comfort him.  Then you're pretty sure you never really cared for him at all and every one knew it.  That feeling can last a few days before you snap out of it, but I feel like it lasts longer and longer every time.  Something eventually snaps me back to lucidity, but I worry that one day it'll last forever.

I think the worst part is I was on drugs for a good chunk of my life.  I sobered up in January of 2009 (five years on the fourth) so I can't even go back to that.  I feel like my mind is frantically building walls of sand to reinforce my sanity, and that one day the tide will wash in and overtake me.  I have never had thoughts of suicide, thanks to years of depression and finally dealing with it, but I do think about moving my family to where no one knows us and we aren't the People With the Dead Kid.

Anyways, I work as a first responder and the weather has meant working twelve hour shifts driving a vehicle alone by yourself.  Not a big deal, I drive 8/24.  Something is different about 48/96 though.  Your stamina just runs out and eventually you stop having things to think about.  

No one talks about death in infants, what is appropriate and what isn't.  I tried to think about our ancestors for a long time.  How people wouldn't name kids until they were a few years old.  How infanticide is in our genes.  God forgive me, but it helped for a while.  Eventually it always comes back around, and I cannot escape it.  I feel selfish feeling this way.  

I have done this terrible thing that has stamped me and branded me and has become my identity.  If I have a bad day, the only questions I get are rhetorically.  Every one already assumes it's because I have a dead son.  I no longer have minor events that upset me or daily occurrences that hinder me.  If I say it was something at work, people almost seem disappointed.  So eventually you just stop complaining.  People expect you to be somehow above it all, to turn in to some wizened survivor that sees the bright side in life.  I want to scream and complain, but I also feel like that's what they want.  Every one wants their Hallmark moment, where they can drop a quote and be a stone in your Path to Recovery.  Like one day you'll make a toast about how hard it is, but it's okay you've survived and beat this dead kid thing and look at them and give them a weary, trusting smile.  But I don't want a Hallmark moment.  I want a Men-in-Black moment, where someone will wave some wand and make me forget for a little while.  Not forever, but just long enough that I can get a cup of coffee or play a game without this sense that something is wrong.  So my wife can be five minutes late and my first thought isn't that she's dead.  So my son can be sick and I'm not worried he'll die in his sleep.  Maybe I'm just overly cynical.

I don't really want to ""get over"" it or ""move on"" or whatever therapy buzzword exists.  I'm not suicidal, I maintain my work, I am a Good Husband and act like a Good Father, I don't drink or do drugs anymore, so why do I have to make steps?  I like spending a few hours a day crying and remembering and looking through pictures.  I like being at events and imagining what Clinton would be doing.  I like Christmas shopping and making a mental list of what I would have gotten Clinton.  I like looking at bunk beds even if we don't need them.  If I like all that stuff and it's not hurting anyone, why do I need to make steps to stop?

Some memories I've skewed.  That was one of the worst moments, when I realized I forgot what I dressed Clinton as for Halloween.  Pumpkin, but I forgot until I looked up pictures.  That's the thing with memories, eventually the colors fade a little and you've got gray, then you start to forget why it was important at all.  Then every once in a while you go to the zoo and in a rush you gain access to some memory you haven't tapped yet.  Or you pick up an ornament and remember clearly Christmas night and your baby has smashed chocolate all over his face, the byproduct of his brother sneaking him a cookie and his gums doing the rest.  I'm scared that some day I'll run out of memories, and there will be no more moments of clarity.  I think that's the ""meaning"" of life.  Make as many memories as you can and never stop creating them.  One day that's all you'll have left, and a picture is just a cheap substitute.  It's the difference between masturbation and making love.  That feeling of connectivity when you remember how his weight felt, what the animals around you smelled like, how you reached back and he held your hand in the car.  I don't know how or why we create these memories.  I feel like I have all the parts to create new memories:  some times, I can remember how his weight felt; some times, I can remember his dimples; some times, I can remember the smell of baby powder and dried milk.  But like some high schooler stuffed into an art class, my vision exceeds my capabilities.

Anyways, I'm just a bit sleep deprived after the emergency operations and have been thinking about him nonstop.  Came home today at the end of my last twelve of the week and this bill was there.  I had forgotten that we'd have to pay for his care.  There's also a $600 ambulance ride I forgot about.  I don't mean to make a statement on national healthcare or insurance or hospital bills or whatever.  It's just the reality of the situation.  Sorry for rambling.

Thanks for reading.  I've uploaded some more pictures of Clinton:

edit at 2130 EST:  I'm truly, deeply touched by each of your messages and posts.  I've been hesitant to kind of reach out because it felt like family members or other people close to it used my son as a conversation piece, and it always made me so mad (in all fairness to them, that's probably in my mind).  I honestly just expected to get a lot of karmawhoreing replies, which would be understandable.

I reread what I wrote (after a few hours of sleep) and I feel kind of, well, dumb.  I have no idea why in your mind your thoughts sound pathetic and weak, but rereading it on ""paper"" makes it seem less intimidating.  It meant so much to hear so many of you felt the same way.  I feel like a horrible person for having those times I just want to forget about it and have some time to myself, but knowing that it's not insane is comforting in a way I can't describe.  I know I need to see a therapist, I guess I just feel like that's the last step before it becomes out there.

It's amazing to me how sharing grief can make it seem so small.  I cannot imagine going through what some of you have mentioned, stillbirths and losing week old children, or losing a preteen or adult child.  I simultaneously think knowing Clinton's smile and laugh, but not knowing his favorite color or subject in school, makes coping easier.  I could not imagine losing a parent, both of whom are rocks to me, or losing any of my siblings.  I don't know exactly what I mean, but I guess this grief is mine and I couldn't imagine dealing with any other kind.

Thank you so much for offers of financial support, pizza, reddit gold, and other sacrifices.  We are fine financially, I guess it was more the bill was a shock that sent me reeling for the first time in a few months.  The holidays were, for whatever reason, not that big a deal.  Just keeping busy I guess.

I also just want to take this space to say this wasn't meant as a PSA for rear facing car seats.  CPS investigated (no neglect/abuse), and the coroner said it was a freak occurrence.  

Thank you so much for your words.As a parent who has had to go through losing my baby girl, I wept in seeing this.I still receive stupid reminders from her insurance company, and the hospitals reminding me of check ups. I lost her 6 months ago the 12th, and many friends did not know how to act or what to say. And truthfully, nothing does it. :(I let her be researched on because of her disease, and have recently had to ask my family to filter out mail about her. Stash it away.Its bitter sweet to see little reminders... because it reminds you your child was real. A person, and no matter how soon you lose them, you love them...Stunning post. I'm not even going to take the time to put this into a coherent flowing response. I'd rather just post some raw impressions in bullets.

* As a parent, one of my greatest fears is what you are going through.
* I don't know you, but it sounds like to me you were/are a damn good parent and your family got a raw, shitty deal.
* It sounds like, to some extent, you are torturing yourself, but it's your right.
* I hope you are careful to make sure that while IT IS your right to remember Clinton, you don't do it to the exclusion of enjoying your son and wife. I hope that came out right.
* Six months is barely a blip - it's no wonder this still weighs so heavily on your soul. I'd love to say it will get better with time, but I've never been through this, so it would just be a platitude. Only the luckiest go through life without experiencing tragedy - mine was a catastrophic car accident that radically altered my mother's life (and my own) and eventually ended it early. All I can say from that experience is you never really get over it - you just find a new reality, a new equilibrium.
* Don't sweat the medical bill if that's even a worry - I have Crohn's Disease so I always have some pending balance with someone (and I have pretty good insurance). If it's even a concern, tell them you will pay them $50 a month and that's all you can do. Most will negotiate.

This was about the rawest, most honest post I've seen on Reddit. I wish you well and hope that someday life will bring you joy again.New dad here, your son smiles like my son. This is the first time I've ever read something on Reddit at work and cried. Im so sorry for your loss, I cant even imagine. You're a strong person, you really are. I would not be able to handle it the way you did. I work for a Women and Children's hospital and when babies die we do not send the family a bill. We bill insurance and write off the patient portion. We also flag the chart so that anyone from the hospital or any affiliated MD offices get a giant flashing warning when they look up the patient. So we don't mail out appointment reminders and things like that. I never really appreciated those policies before but now I wonder why more hospitals don't operate that way...especially nonprofits. Best of luck to you and your family. I feel the pain man, hardcore.  My 5 1/2 yr old died 4 yrs ago, and i still get bereavement letters from the hospital.  Every. six. months.  It sucks losing a child.  He was was diagnosed with a rare seizure disorder on Thanksgiving day at 7 months old, i was the 1st responder the night he died, everything, and i mean everything changes.  I am so deeply sorry, i hope the two of you heal together.As someone whose one year old always naps in her car seat, I am now terrified.  Is this common? Or even at all preventable?Jesus christ.  That newborn picture got me.  What a beautiful smirk.  I'm so sorry.Its no happy ending for you but your son is a hero. There are several other parents out there whose baby is now alive. Again, it is not a perfect ending, but Clinton's senseless loss prevented potentially 7 other senseless losses. Thank you for sharing your story.It does not get any easier with time, I lost my first born and only son to crib death when he was 3 months old to the day, sep 13th - december 13th 1986.

I understand where you're at but don't second guess anything, we all have our time, if it is 3 months or 3 decades.

Find some support from family / friends and deal with it all the best you can.Sometimes, when I hold my son, I think about how his weight feels or I smell his hair. I close my eyes and think about how fleeting life is and I cherish him more in those moments. 
While I'm doing that, I'm hoping I never have to face a reality where those memories are all I have. 

It breaks my heart that you do. I'm so sorry.

Thank you for sharing your experiences and reminding us all not to take for granted what we have. Your voice is sober and your perspective is too real. 

Tl; dr: I cried. I've handed out these medals. I don't know if you will ever read this. But from someone who works in the field of recovery, thank-you.  If you ever need someone to email and chat with contact me. The greatest things we do require the greatest loss.  I was a emt for 10 years. I have never been in your position but I see it everyday. Good luck my internet friend.I'm guessing this means your baby died six months ago, and you donated their organs, but have been sent the bill..? Sorry for your loss :( I stoppped logging in to Reddit a long time ago, lurking seemed just as productive as the stupid things I wanted to say from time to time... But I had to do so, to say that what you wrote was moving, articulate, so well put and very profound. Obviously I am so sorry for this loss and pain you have to go through- but the insight you have and the way you expressed it resonate with me and I'm sure so many others who have experienced senseless tragedies in life. I'm sorry you have to deal with financial bullshit on top of it. Stay strong.  Sorry for your loss. In 2007, my son was still born; it still haunts me to this day. I wouldn't say it gets easier as time goes by, but you do come to accept it more. As hard as that is/was on me, I can't imagine how much harder it would have been had I gotten to know him before his death.

What helped me the most was making a little memorial out of wood. Nothing fancy, it just gave me a way to express my grief. I made it a few months after his death, but still haven't completely finished it, it just feels to me like that would be too final. 

We also still celebrate his birthday, that seems to help my other kids cope with it. Again, it's nothing big, we just talk about how old he would have been.

As others have mentioned, infant death isn't something that is talked about a lot, but a lot of people have gone through it. It can really mess with you, and was a major factor in several big changes in my outlook on life. Best of wished to you and your family.That was the most powerful post I've ever read on Reddit. I can't imagine the depth of your loss. Thank you for sharing your sweet boy with us. I hope you find peace.All of us only have today. 

I hope that your days make more sense in the future.

 Know that you have reminded a whole lot of people to be thankful for the day that they have right nowI have not the ability to express with words how your post has affected me. Tonight I am going to hug my wife a little longer, a little tighter and I will start shedding tears and she won't know why. Tonight, I call my parents and tell them how much I love them, how much I miss them and how much I regret that horrible things I did when I was a child. May you find the peace you seek OP, may your words find their way to those that need to hear them as well. I am extremely moved by your story and I am humbled by your honesty. Please know that your post has touched every one of us. We may be all be anonymous strangers here, but the emotional connection that we now all share amongst ourselves truly binds us together. 
Thank you for sharing your story with us. Bless you my friend.Thank you for sharing the pictures and your story. 

I know you're not asking, but if you would give us your Paypal account name I would be more than happy to donate to the hospital expenses. Again, it's not out of pity. I want to donate something because I feel helpless to offer anything else. I hope the offer doesn't seem shallow. If you were right around the corner, I would do something more tangible, but this his all I can think to offer. It looks like you donated Clinton's organs. I want to thank you for that. I worked for a long time with children who needed transplants. There are children whose lives are better because your son existed. I know that is a tiny consolation and may even feel cruel. I just want you to know that somewhere, people will always appreciate Clinton and your family.I have been lurking on reddit for a year and change....stupid pics...silly posts...something to read while going to the john....this made me join....I never wanted a child....never wanted a wife....I now have both. I have been so lucky in love and life.  We have a beautiful baby girl named Sophia who is quite literally the only thing worthwhile I've ever created in my life....she is 4 and half months old and just fills me to the brim.  I am renewed every morning by her smile. My cynical, myopic mind is overwhelmed with her joy and laughter. The thought of her gone. Of her not being. Is more than I can take. I started crying after the first line here. She sleeps in her car seat all the time. We hope for it as it makes driving less stressful obviously.  I just can't. You my man are truly one of the old breed. To have the compassion towards the babysitter, to have the strength to carry on being a first responder. To not let your other child fall by the way side.... legendary. I hope I can maybe one day be the gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe. To be a father with such heart and strength.  Truly "" we are not worthy"". I would offer other silly things but reddit seems to have signed in, in this moment and nothing further could be said.  You are loved, your sons are loved, your wife is loved. And the really super cool thing is that, at least for me, all this love has touched me and healed me in ways I didn't know I needed.  In ways I didn't know existed. I want to be for hope, to stand for something other than a quick, cynical remark...to matter...and somehow through your compassion and strength I feel as though a little love and hope has grown inside me. My depression lifts and I think hell yea I can be a father, I can be a husband, I can share and spread love and hope. Dude, you have just changed a young mans life.  I thank you and send you love. Keep on keepin on.I never knew there could be any dangers for a baby sleeping in a car seat. My nieces and nephews all did.I can't relate. I've tried, my mom lost a newborn and never recovered. Best I've read was along the lines of, when a small child or baby dies remember that child was essentially happy their entire life.

Seemed like a nice thought to me, but to be fair I can't relate.He's a beautiful child, and I'm so sorry.  I just have no words.  But I do want to share this video that's like a virtual hug and always helps to lift my spirits.  I hope you find peace again.

Before being captured he swam to shore from his ship with another guy and got help for the crew after they were hit. Later that day he was captured and spent the entire war in a Japanese POW camp. He broke his back twice, was skin and bones, and the doctors expected him to live a few months when he got out after the war. Yet he died in his eighties. Never heard him say one unkind thing about German or Japanese people, either. Reminds me of Lost for some reason. I've seen very similar stuff while snorkeling off Palau.

My life is fucking awesome.  So easy to bitch about the mundane.  The photograph comes from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.

Context: ""It is a scene of unimaginable desolation – a crowd of men, women and children stretching as far as the eye can see into the war-devastasted landscape of Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria. This was the queue for aid at a UNRWA distribution point in the capital, Damascus, on 31 January. The UN relief agency has distributed more than 7,000 food parcels in the Palestinian camp, home to about 160,000 people, since 18 January. The UN has reported infant malnutrition in the community, which has been reduced to eating animal feed. As of this week, all aid distributions have been suspended because of security concerns. Chris Gunness, a spokesperson, said UNRWA had received assurances that a deal allowing humanitarian access to Yarmouk would be implemented as soon as possible. He said: “They have suffered enough.”""Get this: you know how you think about 'ordinary people'? - people that have a life, have a family, have a house, have a job, have a drink? These were ordinary people. This was thrust upon them by armed factions and a government with an iron fist.

Here's Homs in [2011](http://imgur.com/zM5eHJd).

Here's Homs [now](http://imgur.com/ns7as51).

I know that a lot of people get this, but some people just don't seem to. They are overly partisan, they openly lie or spread rumours about either side, they care more about their ideal political system than people.

That's fucked. 

There is no difference between this and something like this happening in New York or Washington DC.Looks apocalyptic. what can we do to help?Just to clarify, Yarmouk Camp was established in 1957 for Palestinians fleeing Palestine/Israel. Before the Syrian Revolution, it was home to hundreds of thousands of Syrian Palestinians. 

Note the utter destruction: apartment blocks completely leveled. 

For some time now, in much of Damascus and elsewhere, the Syrian government has been implementing a ""siege"" strategy in which it incircles opposition sympathetic areas in an attempt to starve out fighters while also 'softening' targets through indiscriminate artillery barrage. 

The result is lines like this. Civilians pay a HUGE price. In fact, this is the point. By engaging in 'collective punishment' (explicitly against the Geneva conventions) the Syrian government wants to make it utterly unbearable for civilians to tolerate the presence of opposition fighters.

This unconscionable approach has been somewhat effective.  
I've followed this uprising and subsequent macabre conflict for 3 years now. One of the ways I try to block out the suffering is to tell myself these people are somehow different, that they're in a different country or a different circumstance

The reality is they aren't. They are suffering as much as you or I would in such a situation

They are caught in the middle of a meat-grinder - a dictator who won't (can't) quit now and an opposition who have become swollen with extremists who do not share the same ideals.. and are intent on turning Syria into the next Afghanistan

One military prison has produced over 10,000 bodies, many with eyes missing, and terrible damage - torture on an almost industrial scale

Politicians in Russia block UN consensus to stand by their ally, and politicians on the other side are haunted by the spectre of Iraq - powerless - all they can do is ""talk"" and throw money at the UNHCR to try to give aid to not thousands, but millions of refugees 

It's easy to criticise, many many good people on all levels, even the highest levels have tried desperately to stop this on a humanitarian level - but hasn't been enough, and we're left with another grim lesson like Rwanda

Whatever we say about our shitty governments, at least we had the opportunity to vote for them, not be saddled with dinosaur autocrats that rather see their country drown in blood before taking one step toward a genuine free/fair election

Very sad stuff
Man, do I take my quality of life for granted.I think I will live in gratitude today. Especially at mealtime. Why is it we hold memorial days for veterans but not the completely innocent victims of war?  There should be an international memorial day to remember all the people who would otherwise be forgotten because they *didn't* fight.  Iv'e been working on this idea for some time, if anyone's interested please message.  those poor soulsHere is a link to donate: [UNRWA Syrian Relief](http://www.unrwa.org/donate)ELI5, what's stopping global powers from coming in to deliver aid?Thats not a queue thats an exodus.This is really the first picture of Syria that has opened my eyes to the struggles they face over there. Stunning photography.When I'm hungry, I pick up the phone and call for delivery. Food in around 30-40 minutes and I'm good to go.

I couldn't begin to imagine not knowing when your next meal will be. Fuck.Wow. Pulitzer right there. Composition, lighting, perspective, not even speaking of dramatic content.

Just wow. I work in a clinic in Canada for newly arrived refugees.  It's unimaginable what these people have been through.  The composition of the photo is something to behold.  There are the obvious symbols:

* the huddled masses struggling to survive
* the war-torn building, nearly falling down on those waiting for sustenance.
* the anguish in so many faces

Then more specifically:

* the man in front is bowing his head as if to say, ""enough, I can't take any more.""
* the man in the glasses up close on the left could be your class mate or a bloke you see in the store.  
* in the middle right is a young boy in a baseball hat.  His Little League season could be starting next week.
* behind him in the distance is a haunting, dark silhouette as if death is queuing up with the hungry

This is easily one of the most haunting photos I've seen in recent memory.If you ever think that you have no reason to smile, realize that there are people in this picture smiling.

We have no context as to why they are smiling... but they are for one reason or another.

Find the good in everything.disgusting and shameful siege warfare on part of the Syrian Army is causing this horror. Palestinian refugees living in their formerly prosperous community have been greeted with rocket, artillery, and barrel bomb barrages while the military blocks all access to food or aid. Even with UN resolutions demanding access to areas like Yarmouk and Homs - they rely on the 'good will' of the parties involved. The ruined streets and buildings are indicative of the 'good will' shown by the SAA and its criminal militias These people had normal lives, normal jobs until one day everything changed. I feel so horrible. :(too much wealth in the world to accept this shit again tomorrowI meet each week with a Syrian refugee family as a volunteer conversation partner.  They were one of the lucky few chosen to get out of Syria and come to the U.S. last summer.  When I'm sitting there with their family, watching the teenage girls on their iPhones, giggling over the boys they have crushes on, complaining about their teachers, acting so typical of every other American teenager.... it's absolutely horrifying to think how close they came to living in the totally different reality shown in this picture.  It was just such a random stroke of luck that they were plucked out of that mess.  Just a random stroke of luck that they're in a cozy home watching Beyonce videos rather than freezing their asses off in a fucking food line.  Their lives here aren't easy, especially for the teenagers who are exhausted from learning English, have to deal with bullying at school, and miss their friends back home.  You can tell the kids are kind of naive to how bad it's gotten over there... but when they talk about missing Syria you look at their parents' faces and you just see this sort of shell-shocked look that says ""I can't believe we were lucky enough to get out of there... thank god my family is safe.""

He's felling a tree with an ax.  However he is not chopping wood.  When you're chopping you're cutting a felled log into smaller pieces.  You'd chop it down a lot faster with the inertial advantage of added mass at the end of that axe.The ax is unusual.  Weighted by an iron or steel handle.
Never seen one like that.   He is chopping,  cross cutting across the tree to fall it.  So actually he's felling a tree.

If your purpose is to sway people away from voting for Ford, perhaps put the signs in an area where they'll potentially have an impact.These ad campaigns seem to operate under the idea that there is actually a chance of Rob Ford being re-elected. Is there? Are people just going to vote for him as a joke?Went to [nofordation.com](http://www.nofordnation.com) to check it out. Honestly I think that website would be more likely to make me vote for Ford. The ""lies"" are actually pretty close to accurate and by rehashing the exact numbers it just makes me more impressed with how well Toronto is doing.Since when is Anthony Kiedis in politics?

one of my friends has a video of it from the other week at Cars and Coffee I'd like one of those.

The second greatest trick was *learning how to fly*.Do the chickens have large talons?Damn, that thing could grab a lot of candy.The first time I saw a bald eagle in real life I was shocked at how big those fucking things are. I was way up in Northern Wisconsin and there were two of them perched on a dead deer just eating the shit out of it. It was pretty awesome. To be fair that's a [Harpy Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy_Eagle), which is one of the largest species of eagle in the world.You're almost there.  If you don't cut your fingernails for another few months, it'll be that long...America's Got TalonThis really puts into perspective how eagles can be trained to take down wolves, etc. Last summer I saw a hawk closeup for the first time perched on a basketball court fence. Fucker was huge. Looked like Danny Devito was standing on the fence in a hawk suit. And he gave 0 fucks, glaring at me like 'bish, I'll crush your fuckin arms and peck out your eyes. keep ballin, muthafucka'. real shit.And he slashes at you with this...A six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the the middle toe. He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say... no no. He slashes at you here, or here. Or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines. The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you. So you know, try to show a little respect. Did you know?

While human hands are open when relaxed and takes effort to close, eagles are the opposite. Their muscles are relaxed when closed and requires effort to open.Holy fuck. What type of eagle?A few hundred years back, falconry was actually eaglery, where hunters trained eagles to hunt for prey. But, every now and then, the eagle would get pissy, and kill their handler, usually by sinking their massive talons into their skulls until they died. Kinda put a damper on the fun. So they got smaller birds, and it was all like, party on Wayne. Damn Dinosaurs! You scary!Yup, that's a dinosaur.this reminds me, I really need to cut my toenails Its for all the freedom it carries.No banana?He needs them to be that big to carry freedom.

I know I didn't contribute anything, but that's just such a beautiful road.You would drive 500 miles and you would drive 500 more?So you drove all the way out there, without talking to anyone or stopping for anything, took one picture then packed your stuff up and went home? That's incredible. Definitely worth the gas money. Okay wow. This is incredible. Do tell what kind of camera specs were used to capture this! 

I mean, to the naked eye, and without long exposure, that moonset cannot be as brilliant as a sunset ;)Awesome photo. I've been wanting to go camping in Big Bend for a long time. Yeah but remember those guys who drove 900 miles for the doritos locos tacos from taco bell?Damn, nature. You're beautiful.I've been wanting to take a camping trip to Oregon's Alvord desert out by the Steens mountains. It is supposed to be one of the darker parts of the nation. Did you stay there for awhile?Okay the timing of this is wild because I woke up this morning thinking about the time I spent at Big Bend. It has been 10 years and not something I think about often.

I still have an illegal geocache there.Zero Light Pollution? Wat are all of those lights over in the next valley?Love it man Don't forget about Big Bend State Ranch!

This was also most likely on positive film (think of slide film) as opposed to color negative film (the kind you see color photos printed on), as the technology for the latter was either highly experimental or just hadn't been created yet. This is also why people mistakenly believe that there were no color photographs from this era; [color film was produced as early as 1902](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_motion_picture_film) but professional photographers thought it was a gimmick (and color film was also incredibly limited and expensive)  and would rather use the black and white film they could actually print from. 

When the US government contracted famous photographers from that day to take photographs for the Farm Security Administration, what resulted were all these masterful black and white photographers going out and creating the iconic Great Depression photos most of you have seen countless times. What is lesser known is that the US Government would provide and also try to get these photographers to use the more experimental color film at the time, which many were reluctant to use, and resulted in gorgeous, jewel-like color slides that were filed away and later discovered by archivists and the like. 

TL/DR: Color film has existed since the early 1900's and the reason they look so good today is that those color images were shot by photographic masters who were accustomed to making high quality black and white negatives for printing. 
I always picture the past in sort of a grainy, low-pixel imagery due to the level of camera technologies. I love these sorts of pictures because it gives me a clearer view of the pastThis is from 1911:

We are just now catching up on film vs. digital quality. pretty incredible if you ask me!Most likely taken on a 4x5 sheet film camera, such as a speed graphic. 4x5 cameras are still in use by professionals today, including myself. A drum scanned 4x5 negative has as much image detail and resolution as a $50,000 - $100,000 digital medium format camera, such as a hasselblad/phase-one/mamiya/leaf. I never pictured the planes in 1942 to be yellow.They had (what appears to be) fluorescent lights in 1942?EXIF says 1942, this checks out. Did anybody else notice [the lady way in the back on the left?](http://imgur.com/9PqZ9Bg)f/64 Club  http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Group_f/64Being in color it makes you see, not a lot really has changed.All I can think of is the [plane from TaleSpin](http://i.imgur.com/e2XvBIZ.jpg).[Picture taken between 1905 and 1915, exact date unknown]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Sunni_Muslim_man_wearing_traditional_dress_and_headgear.jpg)It's weird to think that the past looked just like today. I always imagine the past as some sort of painting or black and white picture. It's weird to think that during the American Revolution and World War 2, the sky was just as blue as it is today. Or if not weird, at least hard to imagine. I posted almost the exact same thing (different aircraft picture, same camera and film, same context) 20 hours before this.

An awesome photo that would probably win awards today, but it's actually from 1947. CRAZY.These are 4x5 Kodachromes.  They get rediscovered every now and then.  Here are some more, posted this week on photo.net:
http://pavel-kosenko.livejournal.com/303194.html?thread=22669914But their faces are always blurred. Why cant I see my ancestors. *why.*It's probably taken on Kodachrome film.  Nothing better for preserving color fidelity over the years, and producing a photo with the least possible grain.

It's a shame no one can develop Kodachrome slide film any more.

Kodak introduced Ektachrome slide film that used stadard C-41 film processing (the same as 35mm color film), and photographers still used Kodachrome, because it produced virtually grain free slides and photos.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KodachromeVery cool pic! Thanks for sharing.High quality photos of the past look futuristic...Film is amazing. It was harder to work with, not very convenient, expensive. But they were doing things with film (and other sorts of analog technologies) that digital still struggles to catch up with.

I believe that eventually there will be a resurgence of analog technology eventually.

EDIT: eventually.Mama don't take my Kodachrome away.

This will be on those ""2014 in Photographs"", right?Damn what a mess, being manipulated by two major powers with an economy going to hell and a government out to get them. 

I really do hope these protesters can convince those in power that these new draconian laws only serve to harm them in the long run. No Jokes. Just wanted to comment that this picture is extremely powerful and personally moving.During the US Civil War there was a priest name Father Corby. Just before two opposing Irish regiments faced one another, Father Corby stood on top of a rock and gave absolution to all there. Both sides knelt down & accepted his blessing. Then went on to brutally kill one another. This reminded me of that event, except here the priest is trying to stop the deaths from happening. *Edit: Colby to CorbyYou can see the fear and sincerity in this mans eyes.  That brave, poor man.To the morons criticizing the priest for not facing the cops or for somehow stopping the protesters ""fighting for their rights:"" 

The last thing Ukraine needs right now is bloodshed. You think all those protesters are united behind one single, pro-rights related idea? The political situation in Ukraine is much more complex than it seems through images alone. Along with people who are rioting against the government are, for example, Svoboda and other fascist/neo-nazi groups that are trying to take advantage of the chaos. 

Revolution should be the very last option, as it often just replaces one form of tyranny for another.

I was touched by the gesture of kindness. She didn't have to do that, but she chose to send it. Made my week, and my wife's week as well. A simple act of kindness can get a lot of mileage and takes very little effort. Thank you. It meant a lot to both of us. Check out her stuff, everyone. She's what we call ""good people"".

Harbor Freight hell yah.I've seen Etsy advertisers before on Reddit, but this takes the game to a whole new level. It would be incredibly easy for the Etsy shop in question to simply write a note, put a necklace round it, photograph it and reap a massive profit increase due to the Reddit popularity surge.

This may well be a completely honest post, but it would be so, so easy for this to be faked and there is a huge motive to do so.

If you *hadn't* mentioned the shop name, that would be a different matter.It took me a long time to realize that that isn't a spinner bait.
Wow, someone on Etsy actually makes their own jewelry... I thought it was all relabeled Chinese stuff.Nice try Simple Diversions!I bought my sister a necklace on etsy from a girl I kinda-sorta knew from my hometown. I had her send it as an anonymous gift but included a message. 

Well, she wrote the message by hand, so my sister got a necklace in the mail from a stranger, obviously a woman, telling her she hoped she liked the gift and that if she thought it was tacky, to give it to her daughter (called the 3 year old daughter by name). 

I never could have planned how hilarious that turned out: I completely forgot I sent it bc I did it online. A couple of months later I called my sister and happened to remember the necklace I sent her. She freaked out, she was like, ""That was you?! I was so creeped out! Some chick I didn't know sent me jewelry, knew who my daughter was, and I had no idea who she was!"" My sister got the gift, read the note, and was so creeped out she didn't even Facebook stalk her, just threw the whole package into a drawer. She said she was super bummed because she loved the necklace and wanted to wear it, but she didn't want to be seen by some sicko stalker wearing this thing. 

Wow. So that's the story of the time my sister kept her shades drawn for two months and lay awake at night wondering who had her address and names of her family members. She warned her daughters teachers she might have a stalker and be extra watchful. Very funny.

Their orientation might stem from magnetoreceptors in toads (see [this paper](http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/6) for more information on The [Magnetic orientation of the Common Toad]).

Excerpt: 
Magnetic orientation is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom, but has been little studied in anuran amphibians. We collected Common Toads (Bufo bufo) during their migration towards their spawning pond and tested them shortly after displacement for possible magnetic orientation in arena experiments.There's true north, magnetic north, grid north and then there's toad north.Cutest little plague I've ever seen.Yo, herpetologist here with some info for the masses. Those are spadefoot toads. Typically you see emergence's like this after heavy rains as the rains stimulate the adults to breed. It's a sign there is plenty of water for the toads to bump toad uglies. These are metamorphs from weeks prior rains, they just left the water body their parents did the nasty in. 

Interesting story: There is an army base in Georgia that runs tanks in certain area on the base. The vibration from the tanks fools the toads into thinking the rains have come only to find it dry. 

EDIT: I was part of a team that did an experiment, similar to what Nanosapiens did. However, we put a barricade around a known breeding pond of many amphibians and reptiles and found that they enter and leave in pretty much the same spot. So, probably, these toadlets are moving away from their nursery pond and to their hiding/upland/feeding/adult locations. If OP were to take photos next year after the first warm heavy rains of the year OP could very well see some of these same toads going in the opposite direction to breed.  http://i.imgur.com/hFp4aKl.jpg

They have no natural predators, so they're not afraid of anything. Problem is: **They're so in need of physical and social stimuli, they can literally die from it**.

**EDIT** As some people are stating, this does not apply to all manatee species. There are those who do have predators (sharks). As with most animals, you should not pet them etc. (even if they crave it) because it's not good for their behavior. I am not a marine biologist so do not take my word as law. Just remember that manatees are fucking awesome and hugeable. I just moved to FL and I'm definitely adding this to my list of things to do! Hypothetically, if you just jumped in the water and started swimming with them, would there even be any danger? Not that I'm you know...planning anything...The world is a beautiful place.See?  Florida's not so bad!  See?My aunt and uncle live right by there, we went 2 years ago.  Sadly they weren't around that time of year.  However when you go down a little bit further there is a public swimming area.  It is insanely clear because of the huge underground water source.  You can snorkel or scuba way down into this thing.  I borrowed someones goggles and floated over the top looking down and actually got freaked out.   My Aunt is lucky enough to work with Save The Manatee for a living. As a kid in the 80's, (it may have been illegal even then, but wasn't quite as conspicuous) she took us to meet some manatees that she had been tracking. They were hanging out around the outflow of a power plant because the warm water that ran out of the power plant as waste made the water warmer and also helped keep a nice mushy area in the grass that they like to eat, so it was a pretty good setup for them at the time. 

We got in the water with them and fed them heads of iceberg lettuce. They really do love being petted. They will anchor themselves to you by grabbing your legs with their little t-rex flippers so they don't float away from the petting and the lettuce. Their squishy, whiskery noses are the best.


 It's great to see people caring and being aware of what's going on with them. There's only about 5,000 Florida Manatees left. 803 of them, 16% of the recorded population, died in 2013. It's going to take effort and awareness to keep them around. Look at that Spanish Moss! And those palms! Florida is so fucking beautiful. 

Whenever anyone asks ""How can you like a state that is 95% swamp land and *gasps* totally flat?"". I chuckle a little and shrug my shoulders in agreement. What I'm really thinking of is *THIS*. Also got to see 300 manatees today. Walmart.""Barbara Manatee! Manatee! Manatee! You are the one for me,one for me,one for me! Sent from up above,up above,up above-you are the ONE I LOVE!"" hell yeah. fuckin manatees.Hey I was there just yesterday! Pretty cool to see something on the front page that close to home.When I was only twelve or so I got a horrible sunburn chasing the ice cream truck down the beach (elusive bastard). Because this my parents figured Blue Springs was the perfect spot to heal. We went on a two hour boat ride to try and see a manatee (this was during summer, not really their time to hang out in the springs) and we saw nothing. Five minutes before we were supposed to get out a manatee swam right under me headed towards the spring head. 

10/10 would swim againLucky bastard.more pictures from Orlando Sentinel:

http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/springs/orl-travel-blue-spring-photos,0,3095671.photogalleryYou're in the wrong neighborhood...commence gentle bumpingSo you saw a family guy episode in the making?Oh the humanateeI was out there today too. Official count inside the sanctuary was 292. The park is very strict and you cannot get in the water except in the summer when the managers are not there. There are heavy fines for interacting with them. My boyfriend and I traveled to Florida over the holiday and swam with them -- something that has been on my bucket list for a long time. It was a powerful experience. The babies in particular are very curious and come right up to you. I've always been skeptical of that ""eyes are the windows to the soul"" saying but....looking right into their eyes is mind-blowing. 

We took video of our experience; it's pretty cool: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF45ANvEhNE&feature=em-upload_ownerI went swimming with the manatees about one month ago, and it was amazing.  I was shocked about how big they are.  I was told that full-grown manatees weigh about 1,200 pounds (or a little under 550 kg), but I did not appreciate their size until I got up close.  They were like the size of a refrigerator and a half.

At first, I was hesitant to touch them because it is against the law, but they starting coming up to me, so I could pet them.  The manatees would bend their flippers and then roll over on their stomachs, so they could be scratched.  These fuckers loved having their stomachs scratched more than anything.

A couple manatees even bumped into me.  It did not hurt at all because they move so slow.  

I highly recommend doing this.  They are in the Crystal River and the Homosassa River in December and January because that water stays 72^o F (22^o C) and the Gulf of Mexico is too cold.  It is only like an hour and a half from Orlando.  So, if you can drive down there in the next few weeks, then you should absolutely do it before the manatees return to the gulf.  To anyone who wants to go to Disney World, take this shit on to your itinerary because I guarantee it will be the highlight of your trip.

It is usually about $40-$60 per person to have a boat take you out there for a while, and they outfit you with equipment.  Getting a full wetsuit is nice because you never get cold, and it keeps you afloat.

Uh yeah, it is so cool.  You guys should swim with the manatees.I live in High Springs, which is 15 minutes away from Blue Springs. I love this area. In my opinion this is the best place in Florida300 you say?

History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.Anybody else about to walk with a history degree?  I just want to know my competition for bartender jobs. :(This here is a top quality submission, thanks OP.Reading these comments makes me remember why I hate mainstream reddit.

Also, making jokes and points about arts majors being broke, working at starbucks/mcdonalds, not contributing to society. Very original. Clearly you are contributing ideas to the world with your lame, repetitive, unoriginal, uncreative jokes.I'd study the shit out of whatever if I had a study to study in.Oh reddit is the epitome of this... They just don't realize it.

Reddit ""Where every terrible stereotype comes together into a single festering pit""History isn't just about what's happened. It can bring you great insight into how human beings work and change over time.

Looks like you were JUST starting to draw a bath.  You get an extra mile away or so while they check the attic, closets, and under every bed, and the hatch gets less likely to be found, as well as far harder to lift.

Because I've seen what the actual place where the Namib meets the sea looks like and it's called NamDeb (short for Namibia DeBeers) or more specifically, Four Plant, which is the largest coastal diamond mine they have. I've worked on it. They take the whole beach, suck it up, then suck the sand out of the potholes in the bedrock and that's the diamond rich stuff. Then they throw all that sand back where it was. The place looks afterwards exactly the way you'd imagine it looks. Like a beach turned upside down.

The Vehicle Assembly Building, where the boosters and fuel tank are attached to the Shuttle, is so large that it can rain inside the building. The door to the building is larger than the statue of liberty and takes 45 minutes to open. On the side of the building is an American flag. The stars on the flag are the 6ft wide, the blue area as big as a basketball court, and each stripe is as wide as a standard car lane. FUN FACT: The road is made from crushed rock because reinforced concrete isn't strong enough to support the combined weight of the shuttle and crawler. They have to periodically replace the crushed rock because it gets pulverized to dust.Not sure if anyone cares but those roads are made up of a bunch of smooth-ish rocks (it's not a paved road) that they have to rake and re-fill after every trip.

Diving in Verzasca River in Ticino, Switzerland

Can anyone cite the source of, or better yet,  where this picture was taken? I've been planning a dive vacation, and would love to be that guy! So tranquil. :) As a scuba diver, this is orgasmic.Could someone edit that guy out for me, I would like it as a backgroundSoon after, he forgot he was underwater and slowly drowned to death.This is the first time I've seen this picture without it being falsely claimed as where two tectonic plates meet.it looks like a picture from outside a fishbowl to inside a fishbowl. Cool effect, but also confusing.The lack of comments shows just how lost for words a lot of people are. Now that's visibility!This so peacefull and serene and private. Since i was a child i got this crave to dive to the bottom of a beautiful seabed, curl around myself and enjoy the silence and the colors of the deep.. Best post ever! Keep up the good work.I'm hungover right now and this looks so delicious, beautiful photoWay to go OP...This is blowing my mind right now...I want to go to therehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3WbXkL0qzAIn response to those who were wondering if this picture had been altered in some way...

Related for those of you that don't already know: Once a helmet has been involved in a crash, replace it as it is not considered structurally sound any longer. 

Edit: Google saves the day! Yep, Bell still does this: http://www.bellhelmets.com/crash-replacementThis is a good illustration of why part of helmet safety is the helmet being slippery.  A lot of people wonder why those cheap bicycle helmets have foam on the inside and a thin little plastic shell taped to the outside.  That thin little plastic shell is an important safety feature.  It ensures the helmet will slide on impact rather than gripping an rotating (and twisting your neck).Think of this guy's jaw if he'd been wearing a ½ shell or ¾ helmet instead... Full face for the win...My dad was telling me about how when he was riding to a motorcycle convention in Arizona, as soon as his group crossed statelines from CA into AZ, they all took their helmets off.

nope nope nope nope.

I don't have to fall off my motorcycle to know I wanna wear a full face every time I get on it.This is stupid. If he wasn't wearing the helmet, he wouldn't have gotten those ugly scratches on it. Two main reasons I wear a helmet.

1. I get to look like a spaceman.

2. Only way I know of to legally conceal your identity.


Bonus - You don't die or get horribly disfigured if you crash. (You also get to look like a spaceman)
My helmet snapped my collar bone 25mm apart when I landed on my head. 

Dread to think what would have happened if I hadn't been wearing it.On my 17th birthday I was hit by a car driven by a 15y/o that was learning to drive with his mom.

I never had a chance to brake the bike and flew almost 15 meters into the air. Broke my left collarbone and had amnesia for like 8 hours.

My integral FM helmet saved my life. It broke near the maxilar and the scratch left on the pavement was a good 10 meters.

I still keep that helmet.



Edit: Fixed Break for Brake.I think a few have mentioned, but be sure to retire that helmet. It will not protect you again. ATGATTI can agree with that life tip.

From the source page:

>A car ahead of [Andrew] on a highway entry ramp stopped suddenly and [he] had the choice of the bumper or the ditch. He took the ditch. Helmet and riding gear took a beating, he was fine. Now that he is a lawyer and a husband, he rides quite a bit less.

**edit: If it wasn't clear yet, this was not my accident. It is not my helmet nor am I the biker.**That'll buff right out. 

Hopefully the rider was wearing proper leathers too. I've been behind guys on the interstate with no helmet, tshirt, shorts, and flip flops. Aka future humanburger...Did you fall when accepting your Grammy?
[**Always wear a helmet!**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueVZCMBaaEs)I bet it made an ugly noise when he was sliding, so it was probably just as painful.I wish I had a picture of mine from my accident. If I didn't have mine on I would either be dead or look like TwoFace from BatmanShould specify 'full face helmet'. I had mine signed by the icu staff/surgeons/nurses.The most amazing thing is that it's a full face Harley helmet. 
At the HD store those have to be the least sold helm.
I ride but not Harley's and with a full helm.My buddy got rear ended a few years ago, his helmet was split to an inch above the visor. His back got fucked, but he's still here because of that helmet.I've sat and looked at one very similar while wondering what a split second thought of having the wind in my hair instead would have dealt. Thanks, Daft Punk. Yeah, while snowboarding at 10 years old I hit a ski-lift pole head-first and *shattered* my helmet.  Always wear a helmet, kids (AND ADULTS). I tell every one of my friends they are idiots if they don't wear one, no matter how good they are.

It's the world's largest museum of science and technology. You can spend Weeks there without coming close to seeing everything. (Source: Spent about 3 weeks there)Are Anakin Skywalker's pod-racer engines really the best way to move a plane?Aww the luggage container on the right looks like it is sleeping.

Edit: All-> aww/r/ThingsCutInHalfPorn/Wait where is the area where you sneak around the plane to silently take out the hijackers and then eventually get in a gun battle down there and jump out with a parachute that's mounted on the wall

There clearly isn't enough room for all that in this cross section, I call fake how many people are surprised at the structural basis of an airplane.. you didn't think we could put hundreds of people on a craft with all their stupid shit luggage and fly them at 10s of thousands of feet up in the air AND do it with a tank's armor plating did you?

Reminds me of flying military transport, where they just ignore the plastic panels and overhead luggage racks and just bolt you into a metal tube where you are exposed to all the wiring and ducts. Much louder too.  Deutsches museum, Munich!The Lufthansa box looks extremely content.Where do they keep the snakes?Wings, Check

Engines, Mostly

Fusalage, Some

Close enough, she's ready to fly. I never could figure out what the notch is for. TIL that luggage doesn't go into the plane indidvidually, but rather in those boxy cart things.mmm dat leg room

Much smaller plane than this - just a little turboprop.  I just kept thinking about how *little* actually separated us from the outside.  The windows, I had no problem with.  The fact that I was sitting less than a foot away from air rushing by us at however many thousands of feet above the ground - that was a little unsettling.

It means he belongs to your neighbor and he's been well trained. They only get a tag after completing bear-human interaction training. Different colors mean different things. The beige one there means it can be persuaded to perform sexually. Go ahead, give it a try!Hey OP. Glad you're ok.

Listen, don't do anything to endanger yourself or others, but please consider the following.

If that bear has been collared there's a good chance he/she has already had at least one strike against them. They don't get many strikes.

When scouting an area for food, if bears are able to determine that there is food there, no matter what happens afterward - no matter how much discouragement there might be, it *knows* there is food there and will return. And they are persistent.

The flip side of this; when scouting, if they are run off before encountering food - or better yet, do not encounter it at all - they will leave. 

So please, please, for your sake and that of this animal that just doesn't know better, don't leave out anything that could provide a reward for it. 

Garbage, obviously, but also gasoline or diesel - any kind of petroleum product. Patio lanterns, kerosene lamps, etc. 

Dog food, cat food, bird feeders that use suet. Anything that would be tasty to a bear, and they aren't picky.

They aren't aggressive so much as stupid and unused to having anything that can threaten them. Don't give it an excuse to stay, and it'll oblige by moving on.

Bears that run out of strikes are killed. Noone wants a bear killed for no reason.A lot of times a tag can mean this bear has had an unpleasant interaction with a human and was relocated. We used to do this at a wilderness management area I worked at in New Mexico... if a bear got into a cabin or raided a bear bag they got tranked, tagged, and deported 50 miles away from the incident location. Second incident got a tag on the other ear and a 100 mile road trip. Third incident they had to put the bear down : (He just didn't want you to have to experience it alone, that's all.Just go give him a nice firm bop on the nose, should clear him right out.Poor guy, someone's probably out looking for him.

That said, there's so much more to the country than Amsterdam. If you're actually interested in the Dutch, I'm not sure how accurate the picture is from Amsterdam. I think it's akin to basing every judgement about Americans on Las Vegas.  
  
And the thing that really struck me the most about this city is just how diverse it is. You can leave the train station and walk past all the coffee shops, past the Red Light District, and within a short walking distance you can visit the Anne Frank House or Van Gogh museum. It's definitely worth a visit. What the fuck are those people doing inside their houses?Maybe this was the photographers interpretation of the city. I mean, c'mon, it's Amsterdam.

Maybe this edit is supposed to be an exaggeration of Amsterdam drug culture?

Every version of this looks photoshopped.It just reminds me of wheel of fortune..But have you seen Amsterdam at night... on weed?

(From when the picture was posted a year ago, in /r/photoshopbattles cred to /u/Daanando)I want to see the picture he is taking!Especially with those sandals.I'd love to see the a photo tens second later when the tiger is dug into this dude's leg and there is much screaming.Hmmm, I'm going to the tiger enclosure today to take some shots, what should I wear...  what should I wear....  I know, some fucking sandals!That cat is about to learn that socks and sandals are bad tasteI'm assuming that moments later, Putin will be petting this tiger.having a male, 20 lbs cat that is nothing but muscle and claws, that would scare the everloving shit out of me.  my boy can do some damage.  that little tyke can cause you several stitches.  Reminds me of Black and Whitecome at me bro!I have never before wanted to be attacked by a tiger, now it is all I want in life.socks. with. sandals.Oh my.

In all honesty, very few pictures touch my heart and simultaneously want me to help support wildlife conservation as much as this.  

It's awww overloaded with healthy dose of respect for what is and what will be an amazingly beautiful and powerful animal.  

I only hope this animals handlers will be allowed to let him/her mature to their full glory.....no matter how terrorizingly awesome that glory will be!

Such an adorable young big cat! Sure it looks cute, but be aware.  Recently at a friend of a friends animal rescue ranch and he had a tiger about that size still on the bottle.  Played with it a little and before I knew it, it ran behind me,  gave my cafe a bite then tore off across the floor to attack a toy.... it happened fast and it hurt, but I didn't think much of it, till I pulled up my pant leg.  Blood.   Little tiger ass hole.  But now I can tell folks I got attacked by a tiger. I wish it was possible to own one of those cute little bastards without all the slashing and mauling. All I can see are socks and sandals.At least he classed it up and put on black socks to match his black sandals.""THEY'RE GREAT""Down vote for being a shoobie. More like he cannot escape his derp.So small.  So cute.  So filled with murder.

My family rented a house at the beach (Sandbridge, VA) when I was 13 or 14. My brothers and I spent the entire day building a ""sand fort"", which was essentially a 3-foot hole in the ground big enough for 3 kids to sit in. When the day was over we planted a few beach chairs around it to make sure nobody stumbled into it by accident.

Well, that's exactly what happened anyways. The next morning police knocked on the door and asked if we were responsible for the hole on the beach. Turns out a random guy was running on the beach in the pitch dark and fell into it, breaking his ankle. 

15 years later and we still haven't lived that story down. http://i.imgur.com/4KFKQxM.jpgI feel like my feet would get really cold in that trenchIt's sort of like an inverted fire pit.And these castles made of sand, slip into the sea, eventually...How far we have comeDragonstone is actually pretty chill when Melisandre is away.Dig out the chair part and put benches/adirondack/lawn chairs there. That will collapse so easily.That's totally me in my dorm back in the school daze.  
  
Except instead of sand, I had a shag rug.  
  
And instead of a fire, I had Rush on the stereo.  
  
Perhaps not surprisingly, I did have the same number of guests. aaaaand it's time to go home.This reminds me of the fort they built in Rocket power.This motivates me to have a bombfire and do this. But laws here in LA about bombfires suck ass, so nvm.I've done things similar to this at the beach before but not quite to this level. If we have a few guys going we'll bring a few shovels with us and dig sand couches out of the embankments going down to the water or up further on the beach so the tide doesn't destroy it. The only problem with not doing it on an embankment is you don't get a good view of the beach and water when sitting because your eye level is so low to the ground. However, if you dig it out of the embankment it's basically like putting a couch on the downslope to the water so you just sit, relax and watch the beach and waves. It gets destroyed with the incoming tide but those few hours are worth it. 

Side note: we once dug a wrap-around couch up on the beach that could sit about 5-6 people comfortably and 8 if you squeezed tight, that's the largest I've ever done. imagine this guy did this during the period in which humans were discovering earth, he would be the party god. sacrifices and strange mushrooms for everyone!This is what pledges are foruntil high tide...Also, probably illegal.It's great until someone accidentally kicks the inner wall, collapsing it, and dumping burning coals into everyone. That is really a great idea!Now just one solid high tide...(evil laugh)Shame he has no one to share it withNow, if he had made the entrance on the other side as the tide comes in it will make a little moat for him soak his feet before being completely washed away.","{'Sadness': 0.122011, 'Emotional_Range': 0.651, 'Tentative': 0.304, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.293103, 'Analytical': 0.061, 'Conscientiousness': 0.243, 'Agreeableness': 0.727, 'Joy': 0.044962, 'Disgust': 0.24054, 'Extraversion': 0.67, 'Openness': 0.357, 'Anger': 0.609059}",{}

winnersThe fact that the shadows caused from the edges of the box don't match up with the edges of the room bothers me. Is that the Pandorica?

What if the entire universe was just some substance with light shining through and refracting/reflecting shadows and that's what we are living in?The new show room at Budget Rugs, Murals, and Ceilings. The Horadric Cube! Get drunk, spin fixture. Try to stand. Is there a name for this style of lighting?  That is, many holes in the shade, kind of middle eastern pattern.  I have seen lamps with it before and I have wondered what it is called.In order for this to work and have a sharp image on the wall, the light source would have to be extremely small.  I can't imagine a point source of light like this being bright enough to cast a strong enough shadow to have the pattern visible when there is enough light on in the room to do other things.  You'd need a 60-100w incandescent-equivalent light source which somehow gives light in all directions but that can dissipate all that heat from its very small surfaces.  I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that a practical system like this would be much less impressive in real life than in this picture.  In the picture (if it is real) the exposure was adjusted to give the impression of a bright room with a lot of contrast.

have some fucking respect. I know this won't convince those who don't want to believe it could be true but here's the deal. Mom died on Dec. 30. Dad went to dinner last night and then told me this morning about what he did. A friend sent us the link to the photo that had been uploaded here. It's all true. 
That's my dad's abysmal handwriting.

Not sure what else I can do to prove it happened. Either way, I'm not going to show dad this thread because it's not what he needs to read right now.I blogged about mom's (Carol's) last days. Writing about it helped me process what I was feeling.

I worry about dad who was married to mom for 43 years but I'm so proud he's finding ways like this to deal with his grief.

So after Ukraine turned down trade with EU, and stuck with Russia basically, West Ukraine had been protesting. This is not to be confused with East Ukraine. They were protesting mostly peacefully. It started to get more violent after around 300 young adults were protesting peacefully got beat by the Ukraine police while they were laying down sleeping. But even after that incident most of the protesting was very peaceful. Then Ukraine made protesting illegal a couple days ago, than the violent rioting began. West Ukraine pretty much had enough and want the Ukraine president to step down. They have already stormed into a governors office and made one resign, after cheering and singing Christmas carols.

During the protesting or rioting whatever so far I think four protestors have died. The protestors that were hurt that went to the hospital a lot of them have been kidnapped, or thrown in jail still wounded. One of the protestors that was wounded and kidnapped got found in the woods beaten to death. Last night the protestors started fires on the street to barricade themselves from the police, using tires to keep the fire going. They were also throwing Molotovs at the police. The police were throwing water bombs at the protestors in below freezing weather, and also throwing Molotovs back.

Today I read that they are keeping the violence at bay until the activists of the protestors get to speak with the president of Ukraine. They want the president to step down.

Some of you may think this is stupid that they are rioting, causing violence. I even had one person ask me why don't they just peacefully protest, what are the police going to do, lock them all up? Well, let me explain. These people have tried peacefully protesting for months. They have been beaten. They have had their right to protest taken away. They are at the edge of the cliff, and if they don't fight back they will fall. And the answer to ""they can't throw them all in jail"" No, they can't, but they can throw a lot of them in prison, and the prisons in Ukraine are not good. People have been known to be tortured. Also if they were peacefully protesting before and got beat by the police, do you think the police would be nice just because a larger group is being nice and peacefully protesting? No. They will beat those people also. It would probably be a lot worse if West Ukraine was not rioting right now and just all peacefully protesting.

It's like a big guy sitting there beating you every day. You have tried to talk to this big guy to get him to stop, you have tired negotiating with this big guy, you have tried everything to make him stop, but he wont. So what do you do? You finally fight him back. Violence isn't always the answer, but sometimes it's the only option left. If a civil war rises from this, the Ukraine Government has no one to blame but themselves. They have put their Ukrainian people against a wall, and the East Ukrainian people have decided to rise and fight back. They should be amended for their bravery against a corrupt government and treated with respect, and not down talked by some of you that have no idea what's going on, or what it truly is like to have a REAL corrupt government.

Also a lot of the red crosses that were there giving medical aid and food to the protestors, have been stormed by the police. I watched one video where the police went into the red cross and stole all of the red cross's stuff. Even shot one red cross member with a rubber bullet in his leg, even after the red cross member showed the police his red cross badge. This is not acceptable at all.

Edit: I also want to throw in here how annoyed I am that on popular news sites this is like 20-30 pages deep, and celebrities are front pages. YUP American news worthless.

Edit: Also going to post the streams I have been watching. So all of you can keep up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrZcAsPKK74 http://www.ustream.tv/channel/euromajdan/pop-out These are streams of the protests that are still going on. They stream 24/7. You can see the police and the protestors.

Edit: I will keep posting when I find out more.

Edit: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/world/europe/ukraine.html Some protestors stripped naked by police, and so on. More signs of brutality.

Edit: Also guys I will keep posting, but it's not hard to find out new information. A lot of it is posted on Reddit, you can also just go to Google and type in Ukraine, the new news stories will be posted at the top. Watching the streams also helps. If you have a Russian friend they can help translate when they start talking on the streams. If not maybe a Russian Redditor can help with that. <3 I really appreciate the upvotes, and I'm glad that some of you think this issue is just as important as I do. More world issues need to be brought into light like this one, enough of the stupid ass news stories that cloud our minds. This is the real world and we need to accept it so we can start helping in any way possible we can, rather it be going there and protesting with them, helping pass out food, or just getting the word out. Anything helps.

Edit: News about talks with the Ukraine president. Posted three hours ago. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25872417

Edit: Mikhailo Niskoguz claiming he was tortured by Ukraine police. Tons of reports have been showing up like this. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25858875 It's funny that none of this though is being posted on any major news site, or if it is, it's a ton of pages deep.

If I got any of this wrong or left anything out let me know. I will continue to post on this thread and the original comment any new news I've received.

Edit: Posting this as of 2:32 EST US TIME (9:32 AM UKR TIME) Posted 4 hours ago. Protests have spread outside of Kiev http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukraine-protests-spread-as-opposition-leaders-try-to-contain-violence/article16480111/

Edit: Read a comment asking what do the Ukrainians want and why they don't leave the country? They want the president to resign, they want trade with the EU still (this will probably be discussed at later times), and they want the right to protest back legally. And exactly where are all these protestors supposed to go? America is no longer accepting anyone that is known to be apart of the violent protests, and there are thousands of people.

Thousands are still able to travel to the states, but the fact remains, that thousands should not have to move from their homes because of a corrupt government. The government should be for the people always. I appreciate the person who messaged me with this correction, thank you. )

I will be posting more on what is happening as of now in Ukraine on this thread post.  http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1w0raq/was_told_to_post_this_for_those_of_you_who_want/  Please feel free to go here, upvote, discuss, and if you know anything about what is going on let me know so I can post it on the thread for more people to read. It is important we keep letting people know what is going on, since the main media is going out of his way not to talk about this issue at all. 

Edit: Whoever gave me Reddit gold I really appreciate it. I really do. Thank you for going out of your way and spending your money. Hope you have a great day, and life.

Please keep checking for updates on this issue on the post I made here : http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1w0raq/was_told_to_post_this_for_those_of_you_who_want/

It's important to keep this issue out in the open so people can understand what's going on, and keep following. This no longer only affects Ukraine but every single person in the world. Human rights should always be of the most importance.

 Yes I was testing the integrity of the road surface with large amounts SPEED!!!here is a cool time lapse of the route in HD.

Just birds that like to flit about as you pass by.Seems like a good place to ensure your governor on your car/motorcycle still works. I always forget about the other end of Rt. 50. Over here in Ocean City, MD it is a 4-lane highway that is pretty much the major entrance to town. In the summer there will be 2 hour traffic jams. Hell of a contrast!In the summer of 2011 my wife and I moved from San Diego, CA to Norfolk, VA. 

We drove from San Diego up to Sacramento, and then followed Route 50 all the way to Ocean City, MD. Spent nights in Ely, NV...Gunnison, CO...Emporia, KS...Seymout, IN...and Winchester, VA.

It was a pretty awesome ride. Nevada, as the photo implies, probably had the most profound scenery of the entire trip. But it was all good, even the endless, mind-numbing day we spent driving across Kansas. 

One of the most interesting things about the entire trip was that the route was marked pretty much every single step of the way. I almost never hit an intersection or choice where I didn't have a marker to guide me. The one place where that did fail was in downtown Washington DC. There was one intersection -- 7th and New York NW, I believe -- without a marking. Fortunately we had lived in DC for years a bit earlier in life, and knew exactly where we were and where Route 50.

Unfortunately we had to get to Norfolk before our moving van did, otherwise I'd have spent another night or two on the road. There were a couple of things -- like the tall grass prairie thing in Kansas -- that we didn't have time to linger around and check out.

Don't know if I'd do it again, but it was something I'll certainly be glad for the rest of my life I did once.Yet I still bet that a cop sits out there, setting up the least suspected speed trap.

You can see a car off in the distance.  It is miles an and miles away. It keeps getting closer and after about 10 minutes you fee like you know them.  Then they pass you.  You see them in your rear view mirror and you have lost the only friend you had his this land of nothing and feel even more lonely.

The elevator itself is actually part of the Sea Life Centre which is the building next door! So you can't use it unless you are having a tour of the SLC :P Still very pretty to look at especially at night when it is all lit up!Black FlagThat one Octodad partI've been there! The elevator ride was pretty cool but the attached aquarium was awful. Admission for an adult was 18€ and, in my opinion, the experience was not worth it. There was a massive fiberglass model of a shark over the doorway and many more inside but no sharks over a couple feet were shown.  There was randomly a hall of mirrors in the middle of the aquarium which didn't seem to fit at all. There was not many other types of sea life and the whole thing was pretty lame. Overall the admission was much too high for the quality of exhibits. The Berlin Zoo had a terrific aquarium though!

TL;DR: Go to Berlin Zoo's aquarium instead of this one!I live in Berlin and didn't even know that this is a thing. I used to work at an aquarium company, and did a little research about this tank years ago. Here's what I remember:

The cylinder was built by a company called Reynolds. It is the largest cylindrical aquarium in the world (or was when I was looking. We used to get our cylinders from them, but the biggest we ever built was 12 ft. 

The tank is built from acrylic. It was most likely done by fusing two or even four (or more!) sections of curved plastic. The glue used for aquariums is cyanide based and creates a chemical bond that makes the seams the strongest points. It consists of an outer cylinder, and an inner cylinder which houses the elevators. 

The hotel has a group of divers to continuously clean the tank. They have one diver in it at all times (one diver out, one diver in). 

I cannot recall if it was a live reef or artificial. My guess is artificial, because when it was built the light requirements for a live reef tank that tall would be ridiculous.

Although, so is a giant cylinder aquarium with elevators inside. 

Also, in case no one has mentioned it, from the fishes perspective, they have a cylinder human terrarium inside their aquarium. Abstergo's HQ in Germany?Creepy!

I have never seen this photo nor did I know this place existed, but I've had a reoccurring dream for YEARS about going with several friends somewhere overseas (I live in the US) and in the hotel lobby is THIS elevator (there's also an expensive jewelry/diamond/glass souvenir shop and a few other shops).  

As soon as I clicked on this picture I got goosebumps and instantly thought of that dream (which I haven't had in a while)!  

...just thought I'd share that.Assassins creed elevator!Now we need a video of someone inside it.  [Found it!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e9PHtUxKHs)This is just Assassins Creed 4 on PC or something Aquadom! I never went up that thing during my three months in Berlin. The 10€ charge didn't seem worth it as a poor college student. Instead I probably spent that money on 10 liters of beer.I'm afraid of height, and being underwater. This is paradise :DI was curious how thick the glass (acrylic) was. Found some info on it. Blame Google translate for any weirdness in the text:

* Habitat for more than 1,500 tropical fish and over 50 different species, such as the lever and the wrasse, Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), puffer fish (Tetraodontidae), surgeonfish (Myripristinae), soldier fish (Tetraodontidae), schooling fish such as king mackerel (Scomberomorus regalis) and monos (Monodactylus argenteus)

* Height of the Aqua dome, 25 meters

* The tank consists of acrylic sheets having a wall thickness from top to bottom of 16 cm to 22 cm

* Height of the acrylic cylinder, 16 meters

* Water column, 14 meters

* Diameter, 11.50 m

* Water ring, 3 meters

* 1 million liters of Berlin Water enriched with 33 tons of sea salt (salt content 3.3%)

* Water pressure is 2.4 bar

* The water is circulated every hour complete (7 Filter / 2 circulators promote each 600 cubic meters per hour - almost the content of the aquarium)
Special Details is the two-story glass elevator inside the Aqua dome (lift height 5 meters / Weight 25 ton / capacity of 48 persons including elevator operator)

All that titanium. Thank you Russia.This will probably get buried, but when I was younger I was fascinated with the SR-71 Blackbird. My godfather was retired Air Force and personally knew many of the pilots, so for one Christmas he got me a Blackbird painting signed by nine pilots. [Here it is in my living room](http://imgur.com/ZeQWlJE). 

My godfather passed away suddenly about 10 years ago, and this is one of the last memories I have of him, so this post hits home for me. The painting is named ""Above and Beyond,"" and it definitely has a dual purpose, as he didn't have any kids, but he treated me like his own. I miss him.ground_speed_check_story.txtThey look like they could be star ships. Heck i could imagine them screaming through space launching missles at star destroyers.Would have been a really cool place to work, but you could not tell anyone on the outside how cool it was.Damn, I can't imagine the diligence and organization when putting these things together. My Favorite SR-71 Story:


There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.


It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.


I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.
Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.


We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""


Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.


Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""
And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.


Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""
I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""
For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""
It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.

For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.That's because [SR-71](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird.jpg) is basically [Y-Wing](http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100523084706/starwars/cs/images/c/cf/Y-wing.jpg)If there are any maintainers looking at this, I know y'all saw the mandatory FOD sign in the backOn Jan. 25, 1966, Pilot Bill Weaver was **flying at Mach 3.18 at 78,800 ft when his SR-71 broke apart around him. He didn't eject, the plane literally disintegrated around him.** He survived but Jim Zwayer, a Lockheed flight-test specialist, perished. Here is his amazing story, great read, hope you enjoy! http://www.thedigitalaviator.com/blog/?p=504

Here are a few pictures of SR-71, 61-7952 (the one in the story above). This SR-71 did the first-ever SR-71 inflight refueling on April 29, 1965. http://www.habu.org/sr-71/17952.htmlMy favourite SR-71 fact is the official procedure they had for if the pilot was attacked by a ground-air missile: accelerate. It flew faster than any missile. I demand little robots be installed on all major aircraft. I don't care about their uses; I just want them to have snarky personalities with only a series of beeping and whistles for communication. Any engineers here working on this?If you squint your eyes it almost looks like there's R2 units in them :PGotta love the big FOD KILLS poster in the background. :)Shameless copy of one of my precious posts:

I heard this story when I was in the Swedish navy. According to the legend (things are a bit hush hush still in the Swedish military) the base that got the radar lock got a postcard a few days later with one word on it: ""congratulations"". It was stamped in the US.

The story I heard was that the Blackbird would usually take the same route at about the same time so the Swedish Air Force had plenty of time to prepare. Sweden also had good computers in the planes so the ground radars could relay the radar lock to the plane that was already in place.

Unrelated: The Swedish navy today is counted to the worlds elite, having performed very well in international exercises:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotland_class_submarine

I also wanted to share a funny story that I heard but haven't been able to verify. HMS Carlskrona is our biggest ship and going into a US naval base we radioed ahead saying our biggest ship was on the way. The US move two hangar ships to make room and when HMS Carlskrona show up the US Navy asks ""Where's the ship?"", thinking it was an escort vessel.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSwMS_Carlskrona_(M04)Dem engines...More like a hanger deck on a battlestar.I just finished reading Skunk Works by Ben Rich, which is a book that's all about the SR-71, F-117A, and other stealth technology. Pretty cool!IMO the Blackbird is way cooler looking than rebel x-wing fighters.

Eels in this so-called ""recruitment"" developmental stage are known as **glass eels** because of the *transparency of their bodies*. Glass eels typically refers to an intermediary stage in the eel's complex life history between the leptocephalus stage and the juvenile (elver) stage. Glass eels are defined as ""all developmental stages from completion of leptocephalus metamorphosis until full pigmentation"". The term typically refers to a transparent glass eel of the family Anguillidae.First thought was that these were going into a Japanese girl's ass.

Thanks internet, you've almost ruined me.are u sure u didn't just glued jiggly eyes to a bunch of noddles ?Looks like something that would swim up my pee hole. Let me tell you a short story about eels. They only lay eggs once in a lifetime, somewhere in the Sargasso sea. After hatching, the larvae drift through the atlantic ocean with the currents. If they don't get caught as glass eels, they will finally swim upstream the rivers their parents once came from. The cycle begins again.

Every glass eel caught means one more eel that will never procreate. Eels procreate only once a lifetime. Catching glass eels is a very safe way towards exterminating the whole species.

there's no other place...My graduation from high school was here. Was unbelievably gorgeous. Those stairs are killer though. Especially in a gown. Such an amazing venue. It's an experience like no other. I was at a ZZ Top concert there once and we got rained out after the third song. Couldn't be mad though. We got to watch the storm roll in from the other side of Denver and come straight at us. It was just a huge mass of grey and black clouds streaked with lightning, getting closer and closer. It was like the world was being swallowed up while we waited for it to swallow us too. Been there. Rush was really freaking loud.

I was really out of shape when I went; the walk up was killer.I've been hitting concerts here since 1983 (U2)... best show I've seen was Metallica (And Justice For all, 1990) in a lightning and rainstorm - they kept on playing - it was literally and figuratively electric.  I've seen Steve Miller there 7 times; and probably more than 70 shows overall.   When we were in HS and went for concerts, we would sit in the parking lot until 2pm - drinking, then line up with all our gear and alcohol (this was before real searching and security existed), just like everyone else, since it was festival seating (few assigned seats), and at 4pm or so, the gates would open and it was a free-for-all to get the seats closest to the stage (sadistically fun to watch drunk or rushing people with hands full of coolers and blankets running from the top coming down the seats and yardsale it after tripping)... we would buy our cross-country runner friends tickets so they could get to the front quicker... Sorry for the stroll down the lane, it's an awesome place.  Mount Morrison behind it is a great, steep little climb, too.I got tickets to see Underworld there. I had to drive from Dallas to Denver. Two days before the show, the venue was changed to the Fillmore Auditorium.
The show was amazing but I can't help but wonder how much better it would have been there.Saw Bruce Springsteen there in 1978. A life-changing experience!I once saw Slayer there. Changed my life.

Camera Operator: KEVIN L. BISHOP Date Shot: 1 Aug 1989. The F-15 pilots are in the process of putting themselves in combat firing positions, but it is more of a precaution (a standard one for the time I am sure) than anything else; full on enemy engagement was rarely expected in these cases as intercepts were not entirely uncommon.

It is also worth mentioning that in other cases, simply by ""straying"" into questionable airspace, the Russians were/are able to easily gauge many factors of American air defense efficiency. Such as the average response time of the aircraft, level of hostility, manner & method of approach and average distance/squad numbers etc.""

You all know what it is.*Cue Top gun music theme*One of the all-time great pictures.

Side note, I wonder who took the picture, and what their role was in the intercept.It's kind of impressive that at the heart of these vaporous comets streaking across the stratosphere at multiples of the speed of sound there are machines designed by human minds, built by human hands, and at the heart of those machines are men, flesh and blood people, becoming something like celestial bodies in motion.I was on a flight one time near the arctic circle and we were intercepted by a Tupolev Tu-95 Bear D. We flew in formation for a few minutes then they broke off in a pretty decent peel away. We waved at one another and I swear I could see smiles on everyone's faces.my favorite jet airplane story:


There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.


It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.


I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.


We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""


Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.


Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.


Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."" For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew.

For those interested, this particular eagle is called a Golden Eagle. It is traditionally used to hunt hares and foxes during winter.I saw a video where they interviewed an eagle hunter.

The hunter was, an interesting figure to say the least.  He was not young, but he was not old. He wore a black robe with gold highlights, and a simple, black cap to cover the top of his head.  He looked to be in his prime, an experienced hunter.  A man who has spent his entire life, riding, traveling, and thriving in the harsh, open land that are the Steppes of Kazakhstan. And of course, on his right arm, rested a golden eagle.  

And so he began: 

""When the hunter feels that it is time to acquire a new eagle, the hunter searches for a very tall mountain, as Golden Eagles only choose the highest peaks to set up their nests.  He climbs for half a day and must snatch a baby eagle when her mother is gone, because Golden Eagles are very protective of their young. 

Every year the eagle is given a new name.  Since the eagles no longer have a mother, the hunter must teach her how to fly.  Every hunter has their own method of training a bird, and after four years, the eagles are ready. 

Hunts take place in the winter, as food is scarce, and the hunter must rely on the eagle for sustenance.  Golden eagles have a wingspan of up to six feet.  They hunt for all manner of prey:small rodents, rabbits, even wolves.  The eagles do not kill their prey- they merely hold it or bring it to their master, and he kills it, sharing a portion with the bird. 

After 10 years it is time to part ways.  Hunters only use female eagles, as they are bigger, stronger, and better hunters than the males.  Thus, after 10 years have passed, the eagle becomes broody and wants to have young of her own.  The Hunter takes his eagle to the top of a tall peak, and brings with him a dead goat.  He leaves the goat as an offering to the eagle - a parting gift for the years of friendship, and service that the eagle has given him.  Many times the eagle is hesitant to leave, and she circles in the heavens, unsure of what to do with her new found freedom.  Eventually though, both understand that it is time to part ways. ""

The hunter took a pause, and at this moment, the large bird took a moment to stretch its wings.  Under its wingspan could easily fit two grown men.

""His first eagle,"" the interpreter continued, "" came back 10 years after parting.  He was happy to see her, but they had to part ways once again, and she flew away one last time.

Kazakhs say, we are the children of the sun and freedom - of open spaces. Once, we knew how to fly, now we ride our horses across the steppes, as fast as the wind.""

Easily, one of the most amazing videos I have ever seen.   Man I'll never be that cool...If the Reddit overlords will forgive me for reusing/slightly updating a past comment I made on a similar photo:

These are berkutchi, one of many names for golden eagle falconers in central Eurasia, which can be used to describe both the 'person who does the act' and 'the act itself.' Golden eagles are not my main area of experience right now- though hopefully they will be a part of my future- but I have picked up a bit about them in my reading/speaking.

In regards to berkutchi specifically, here are some general answers to common questions people have about them;

* Who are these guys?

These are members of the Kazakh semi-nomadic tribe in Mongolia (they also exist in Kazakhstan, and neighboring countries in lesser numbers.) Massive political upheaval and the sometimes forced modernization of the region means that currently there are far less people who live 'traditionally', but in some places practices like this still exist, or people attempt to revive traditions that were lost. [This comment by u/monkeyarse](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1q9fev/mongolians_are_cooler_than_you/cdaxai5) has more information on this cultural shift, which also explains why there are many more berkutchi of Kazakh descent in Mongolia than Kazakhstan itself.

* Why do they do this?

For tribal peoples of Mongolia, there is heavy reliance on animals and particularly meat. It is a rough, rugged land of steppes and valleys where winter means vast, empty landscapes full of big fat nothing until the Summer pastures push up from the ground for their herds. Foxes and wolves are hunted for fur while rabbits and gamebirds are hunted for meat. In order to do this in such a sparse and mountainous place, golden eagles are like bullets that can change course and spy prey on the horizon, making them great hunting partners. Animals that do not make good food for people can be eaten by the birds while the fur is used for clothing.

Unfortunately, some people capitalize on the recent popularity of these kazakh hunters, most famously because of that one episode of *Planet Earth*, and capture golden eagles for use as tourist props (you will see many pictures of ""berkutchi"" that are not berkutchi at all.) You can go to Mongolia and pay to have your picture taken with an eagle the same way you can go to Las Vegas and have your picture taken with a cowboy. This is not the same as the traditional use of eagles in winter survival.

* Where do they get the birds?

The birds are trapped from the wild.

* Isn't that cruel?

Golden eagles can be taken from the wild and used in hunting without major trouble and often times with great benefit to the bird, *so long as* it is done by someone who knows what they are doing. Humans cannot spy or incapacitate nearly as much prey on their own, and eagles cannot protect their kills from scavengers or survive the brutal winter nearly as well alone, so in this way a team with the hunting prowess of an eagle and the safety/fore-planning of a human is born. Traditional berkutchi have been taming and using golden eagles for centuries and come from what is thought to be the origin of falconry. However, I will say that from what I have seen, the general conditions the birds are kept in or methods used would fail to satisfy the strict legal requirements of keeping one in America. Sometimes the conditions of the birds seem quite rough. Remember though that these birds are working animals in a nomadic tribe in inner Mongolia. Human and animal live hard lives.

* Is this a common practice in Mongolia?

No. Very few are still around, I believe it was less than 400 people. (In fact, the village with the highest concentration of golden eagle falconers has a grand total of 14. It's not as though every home has an eagle.) Urbanization and youth migration to cities is in large part the reason as the nomadic lifestyle dies out.I wonder if that eagle has ever brought her back a small dog..That is one big bird.[Ashol Pan](http://i.imgur.com/7AobM5j.jpg) nsfwThere was a show made by the people who did Planet Earth but it was about people in remote locations and the amazing ways they lived and survived. These Mongolian hunters were featured in one of the episodes, you see a father teaching his son how to train the eagle. They live with the eagle, it's basically like an extension of them, they have a deep bond with it. Then they show the son and his eagle get their first kill (a fox) after failing a few times. They look incredibly badass galloping on horses with these eagle on their arms. I will be back shortly with the name of the show after some Googling...... 

Edit: Human Planet. Wow that was obvious. Ep 6 ""Grasslands: The Roots of Power.""  But seriously every episode was awesome, they showed people who lived in extreme cold and ice fish for sharks, people who lived in the jungle who made bridges out of fallen trees and vines, etc it was really cool. 

Edit 2: Changed ""falcon"" to ""eagle"" because apparently I had the wrong bird. I also just remembered that the son scaled a mountain to steal an eagle egg (or maybe it was an already hatched baby eagle), and that was the rite of passage all boys had to go through to get their eagle. I mean, damn these people are bad ass. That eagle is bigger then my apartment.This reminds me of a couple of years ago, when /u/keenonkyrgyzstan did an IAMA on Kyrgyz and Kazakh eagle hunters as part of his Fulbright Scholarship work.  It was probably one of the most interesting things I have read on reddit to date.

It was quite a surprise to pull in and see how close the Pyramids are to everything.

It's the most amazing view I've ever seen, and it's from a pizza hut/KFC. I remember seeing this KFC on an episode of ""An Idiot Abroad"".

As sad as it sounds, if you're a few shades too white, you won't be able to move a foot down the road leading to the pyramids without peddlars trying to sell you something. No matter how resilient you are, they will harass the daylights out of you, and that's especially true of (attractive) women. 

The area around the pyramids is full of garbage. See, we have this godawful habit of throwing our garbage wherever we go, but near the pyramids, how come no one is cleaning that shit?! This is a sacred site. It's a wonder of the world, and yet it looks and smells like any other shithole within Cairo proper. It's downright embarrassing.

If you visit Egypt, do yourself a favor and stick to Upper Egypt (which is basically the south of Egypt - Luxor and Aswan). If you can afford it, take a plane over to Sinai...great opportunity to socialize with people, go snorkling, diving, and what have you. And then hop on a bus to Petra, Jordan where they actually look after their national monuments.

Battleship: Movie Tie In Edition (Tied into the movie Battleship (Which was based on the board game battleship)). Nerf Rebelle. Pink guns for girls, because the pink-only girls definitely want to play with guns, and the gun playing girls DEFINITELY want everything to be pink. Guns named heartbreaker and sweet revenger- Because crazy female emotional wrecks are just the thing to associate with guns, err, blasters. Did you notice how Katniss and Merida's Bows were pink and glittery? You didn't? Well you should go watch movies on shrooms like hasbro does. That must be why they keep signing up Mike Bay to play with Transformers and GI Joe that are neither nostalgic or relatable to the actual brand. Meanwhile, the lego movie makes a movie with actual legos in it, and guess what, Its probably going to be nominated for an academy award (Best Animated Film).

You make it VERY difficult to pass you with the way you roll in and out of the lane. Once you had the lead you weren't going to give it up. 


Also, thanks for repping the short-shorts. You're every distance runners favorite because of it. 

If anyone wants to watch another amazing race from this weekend, check out the women's 800m:

I hated the 400 in high school, you just absolutely want to die after. 

You guys must have run this race at a very slightly slower pace than I ran a 100m.

Dammed impressive, well done gentlemen. I like how you guys celebrate by running around really fastwell done guys! SO well done! congratulations! your hard work and dedication has paid off! :)

just watched the video (link posted by CaptainNoBoat) .. amazing!Any interesting stories or something worth mentioning about Poland or Polish people? Congratulations of course!Great job on winning Poland all for the US!You guys are awesome! And you didn't just break the WR- you shattered it by 0.7 seconds?? Holy balls that's fast!

Post this to /r/sprinting and /r/running and they will adore you even more than the people here have.I like how when they find out they won, they celebrate by running some more.

I totally understand people wanting to know in this context, but I am all about being able to verbally dictate a bond of life-long good friends. Never thought I would see a track photo as the top post on Reddit. Today is a day filled with happy tears.Congratulations! I think an AMA might be in order.

> USA’s men’s 4x400m captured the gold medal and fittingly finished with the first and only World record mark clocking 3:02.13. Kyle Clemons (Lawrence, Kan.), the 400m bronze medalist, handed off after the first leg just steps behind Great Britain, but David Verburg (Gainesville, Fla.) gave Team USA the lead on the second carry, before Kind Butler III (Indianapolis, Ind.) sprinted away with a 45.41 third leg to give the squad a solid lead. Calvin Smith (Atlanta, Ga.) went out very calm and controlled on the anchor leg and was stellar over the final 100 to clock 45.12.

I told her she had the wrong number, and she didn't get it. She said she met me on the party line last night. I told her she was mistaken, I was at the movies with my wife last night.

Lanticia lost it. She called me all kindsa names, saying I'm a ""cheeta"" and that I ""ben cheetin"" and she said ""ima tell u wife u ben onna party line cheetin wit grlz""

This creates a 1G+ force going ""up"". The liquid would rather follow the stronger ""up"" force than the downward gravitational force. 

Fun fact: the upward force does not actually exist. It is fictional (it's the centrifugal force). That's why I used quotes around ""up"". The upward force is fictitious, while the gravitational force going downward actually exists. 

Source: physics guyPhysics is cool
Physics are coolThat shaka tho.This picture is really interesting.  The plane is flying inverted but it is in the middle of a loop.  The relative force of gravity is 'up' in this picture because the plane is travelling in loop.  You are sitting in a plane and pilot pulls 'back' on the control yoke (stick).  The planes goes in a complete circle at a rate that allows the vector of ""gravity"" to be toward toward the bottom on the plane at all times regardless of what the Earth does.  Think of it like a loop in a rollercoaster, you are being pressed 'down' into your seat.  Same thing here.  Physics = funThis guy is the boss that did it first.

There is a zoo in Norfolk, VA that has some Orangutans. It is the saddest thing I have ever seen. They are visibly depressed ALL the time. They put them in an enclosure nothing like their native habitat. They basically sit in a little cave and hide, covering their faces with blankets all the time. I have seen them probably twenty times over the last 3 years. Every time is the same.

They don't belong in zoos. We know it, they know it. It just isn't right. And I am not typically one of these uppity types about it. But those animals are smart as fuck and they know what we are doing to them. It is completely cruel in every sense of the word. If I thought that they would be slaughtered in the wild or we were breeding them to preserve the species, that would be one thing. But man, they just do not belong in that habitat. It's sick. Just imagine being caged up somewhere that is literally not even pretending to be like home (it's a plain with grasses and some ropes for ""play"") and opting to sit in a corner and hide under a blanket to avoid being gawked at all day.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes....I'd love to know if it ever caught anything, or was just going through the motions - like a child playing dress-up...I did a zoo experience last year and when taking us round the orangutans they told us about how, when they first gave them water bottles to drink from they just broke them open, drank some and then put them down, spilling the rest.  After watching zoo visitors for a few days they worked out how to open the lid and then close it again meaning the water wasn't wasted.

They are super smart animals and you can totally see how close we really are, evolutionarily speaking.gonna need an accompanying article foe me to buy that he was actually fishing. This is a very old picture. I've seen it many times. It is at least 5 years old. Probably older. Never heard the story in the title connected to it, though. 

Source?Give an orangutan a fish, and he'll eat for a day.

Teach an orangutan to fish, and he'll sit on a boat and drink beer all day.What if they watched tribe wars... Well I'm the king of the swingers yeah,  the jungle VIP.... What I thought of immediately - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunston_Checks_InThink of it this way: without the support of our society, individual humans are pretty rubbish. Were no smarter, biologically, than we were 50,000 years ago. So it stands to reason that an ape could also learn a lot from our society and use it to improve his performance in the real world.Somebody really fucked up the prime directive. This was posted several times before. Also, he doesn't seem to be spear fishing, he's checking the depth of the water. Orangutans don't spear fish. It's just a cool photo that makes it look like he does.

Ridiculously cool. :)

^I ^wonder ^if ^tortoises ^dream...You should buy him his own mini fridge and decorate it like a cryogenic unit.Well, this post has got loads more interest than I thought it would! Thanks for all your interest and I will try and get around to answer as many questions as I can later today.

In the meantime, here are some more pictures of Charlie, both more recent in the summer (when he was less sleepy/grumpy!) and when he was a couple of months old:

http://imgur.com/a/FRdTJ

This should answer some of the most asked questions:

Everything relating to hibernation is dependent on several factors, mainly the type of tortoise, the tortoises age, and the tortoises health.

Charlie is 8 now, and hibernates for 6-8 weeks. With our unpredictable winter's here in the UK (and many other places), the best and safest place to hibernate him is in the normal household refrigerator! They need to stay between 3 and 7 degrees centigrade ideally, and if they drop below 0 degrees they will probably die (or go blind due to water freezing in their eyes), and if they approach 10 degrees then they will wake up (and without food they will probably die fairly quickly once their initial 'energy burst' is used up). As long as your fridge is opened a couple of times a day, then it's the best place IMHO.

Not all tortoises hibernate, but if their species do hibernate, then they should definitely be hibernated - their bodies are only designed to be awake for a certain amount of the year, which is why they should still be hibernated, regardless of whether they can be kept warm in a hotter climate or not.

Some 'tropical' tortoises from eastern climates don't hibernate. Most Mediterranean species like Charlie (who is a Hermann's tortoise) do.

Unhealthy tortoises shouldn't be hibernated.

Tortoises are hibernated for different lengths of time dependent on their species, age, and weight/size. This is usually from around a week during their first year, to up to 20 weeks when they're fully grown.

During hibernation he won't do anything except for breathe (but this is much more slowly than usual - only several breaths per minute). It is a very deep slate of sleep/unconsciousness. The first thing he will do when he awakes and is 'warmed up' is poo/excrete everything that has built up inside during hibernation. Its a bit nasty and is a mixture of poo/uric acid (a sort of white, sold, urine type poo).

As long as you keep him between 3 & 7 degrees C, he can be handled whilst hibernating to check his vital signs/breathing etc and he won't wake up! Its a very, very deep state of unconsciousness.

During the summer here in the UK, Charlie pretty much roams free in my garden between May and September. Between these months he is very low maintenance now that he is older, and pretty much lives of what grows in the lawn (Dandilion, clover etc). We supplement his diet with occasional pieces of romaine lettuce and Kale, but you have to be very, very careful with what you feed tortoises. Bad diet and poor dieting advice is one of the most harmful things to captive tortoises! I.e - for Charlie, he should only ever eat 'Weedy Greens' as a rule of thumb. He gets NO pelleted food/fruit/meat/processed foods etc.

It's also interesting that Charlie doesn't really drink (only very rarely in the summer when it is very hot). He gets most of his liquids from his food!

And it is also worth mentioning that EVERYTHING I have said or mentioned here is specifically in relation to my tortoise, Charlie, who is an 8 year old Hermann's tortoise. Each species of tortoise require a very different type of specialist care (especially when it comes to diet, climate and hibernation), and so be aware that this advice does NOT apply to your tortoise - who will have their own individual care requirements! (This is even the case if they are a Hermann's tortoise like Charlie! Every tortoise is different). Make sure you get proper, sound advice from a good 'Tortoise Trust', reputable breeder or charity - NOT PET SHOP.

EDIT: I seem to have received mystery gold! I can't quite work out which post this is for or how it happened, but thanks you lovely people! :)Now in 6-8 weeks post pics of when he wakes up!:(:|:DWill it poop?How do you know when he is ready to hibernate? Do you just wake up one day and say..""today is a good day to put my turtle in my fridge."" Or does he start to fall asleep? This honestly is the best/most interesting thing I have ever seen on reddit. Did you cook an entire pizza then put the whole thing in the fridge? ""Did somebody leave a turtle in the fridge again?  Everything tastes like turtle...""[deleted]Well when my friends turtle died she preserved it in a jar and put it in her  kitchen cupboard.

*edit* 
Just realized OP's turtle is not dead... WTF is this?I need a bigger fridge for my pet bearTough tortoises hibernate where they live. Mine, got him from my mom, who got him when she was still a kid, is living in our Garden in Germany for about 50 years now. His age hasn't been tracked but he has to be something around 60 from our best guesses.

Every Spring around Eastern we can start looking for him to turn up. It's always fun :)[struggling to edit from my phone]

Also, we use the box to protect him from any knocks or inquisitive visitors, and to keep him well insulated if the fridge door is kept open for several minutes! (If he were to warm up he would wake up)I read most of the comments but I didn't see if you answered if it is a necessity to do this. Would they just starve to death because he'll refuse to eat if not allowed to hibernate. Also what if you simulated a ""summer"" climate all the time, would it be necessary? Ive NEVER heard of this and I'm naturally curious! :DI was intrigued by this, and read about it online. Apparently it should be in a separate fridge. 

""Q. Can I use the same refrigerator I use to keep food in?

A. No. Absolutely not. There is a SERIOUS danger that food could become contaminated with potentially LETHAL pathogens, including salmonella. No refrigerator used for tortoise hiberbation should EVER be used to keep food or drink in.""

We were fortunate enough to watch this Massive eagle swoop down from the tree top and pick a 30~ pound salmon from the water like that crane game ""Animal House"". However, the birds eyes must of been to big for its stomach, For when it started to ascend You could see the bird struggling with the weight of the fish. It carried the fish for about 300 yards before coming close to the trees. He/She must have underestimated the landing cause it knocked itself out on a tree branch for about 2 hours. We sat around and watched for it to wake up. When it finally did bird just ate his prize. This was one of the craziest things i've ever witnessed in nature. Velociraptor.

We tried keeping a bonsai *once*. I bought this fancy looking tree for $50 and kept it on our windowsill where it could receive a healthy dose of sun. Forgot to water it one day and that was it. It was an uphill battle since then and the tree slowly died over the course of a week. Worst $50 ever spent. I'm pretty sure I've seen older bonsai at a garden near my place in Shirokanedai. I seem to remember a 600yo label on one. Why are bosais the way they are? size-wise...I'm curious, do they pick these trees up and place them in a pot or actually raise them in a pot? I know these trees are pretty sensitive.Makes me wonder, what's the oldest living thing in the world?Are there any wild bonsai trees out there that could be older?Tending to that must be nerve-wracking.Well it's older than me, that's for sure.I wonder if trees get cancer or if cancerified parts get removed and trees don't care 'cause they have leaves, not mamamal like organs.I don't know anything about bonsai, but the *balance* of this tree is giving me a happy.

Harper is a UNHCR's Representative to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

[Here is a video, which explains the trek the refugees take.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT_M8-0q6NM) ""In a remote area of north-east Jordan, hundreds of Syrian refugees arrive at an unofficial border point after walking for days and crossing a stretch of no man's land to reach safety.""

At arrival UN workers give refugees water, food, and blankets before the Jordanian Armed Forces pick them up and take them to the nearest transit point.

Man, that kid is hard as fuck.Marwan was found by UN staff crossing the desert alone, after he was separated from his family while fleeing Syria. Exact location of photo unknown.

A later tweet reports that he's been reunited with his family. [link](https://twitter.com/HalaGorani/status/435429092486156288)

good god my life has been easyBecause it was a documentary film crew, poor Marwan was left to continue his trek. It should be noted that this kid was not found alone, he was 20 steps behind his family. 

http://storify.com/OpenNewsroom/marwanI think being put in this situation when you're 4 years old is the only way he managed to be found. Imagine yourself put in the situation and all the intelligence you have and episodes of ""I shouldn't be alive"" you have watched. You initial thoughts would probably be oh how you were going to die out here with no water or found or compass or anything. You're just lost.

Now imagine 4 year old you with the limited knowledge you had and few life expediences, you would probably think ""Hey, mom will come get me eventually. I should just keep walking this way. Oh look, a lizard. Man it's hot out here."" Your thoughts wouldn't be that you were going to die, just that you were in an uncomfortable place and would like your mom to carry you. I'm glad he got back to his family. This is so incredibly sad. Hey baby, go home. ""Motherfucker I have kids to feed.""Propaganda is strong recently. US planning to invade? Debunked. He wasn't alone:

https://twitter.com/And_Harper/status/435656670317150208/photo/1Muad'Dib Wow. What a trooper. I wonder how fair he went.

Edit: far*Marwan will try *anything* to escape from Jack Bauer.Story with more info http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/17/four-year-old-fleeing-syria-found-alone-in-the-desert-report/he was not alone. he was with a large crowd.

those same people sympathizing here, their government is arming the people that caused this.  pathetic. this is why your government has it easy, what will you do ? ""omg thats horrible"" then go back to your dinner table. only way you get to read your filtered and censored news is from foxnews and cnn or a shitty emotional random thread online.This will probably get buried. I was like, ""Wtf is a Marwan. Oh, it's a child...

Fuck  them. Fuck them. Fuck them. Just do it.Miskeen ya hebeebi!thats insane.This is really sad. I'm sure it happens all the damn time, and I'm sure that more often than not there isn't a happy ending. 

Hopefully is family is alright and he's able to be reunited with them, or something. 

Wars and conflict suck. Wow, it's hard to see children put through harsh life events at such young ages. It's amazing to wonder what was going through his head.

It's just a white variety of eggplant. Purple eggplants are still purple when they are small.K, now explain ""aubergine""  Not until I started dating an American. 

Cilantro was the other one the got me. She was cooking, told me to go out and get some cilantro. ""What's that?"" I asked. ""Oh it's a really common herb, every supermarket will have it"". 

Three bloody supermarkets later (the first two no one know what the hell I was talking about) a kind assistant said ""I think that's what the yanks call coriander"". 

Fun facts about Eggplants:


* Eggplants **aren’t REALLY vegetables**, they’re berries. Which isn’t that strange, considering other fruits are commonly mistaken for vegetables – like tomatoes.
* **Eggplants and tomatoes are actually related**. They both belong to the nightshade family with the famous literary poison – deadly nightshade. But don’t worry, eggplant isn’t toxic (at least not in normal amounts).
* A study published in 1993 in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that eggplant has by far **the highest level of nicotine of any vegetable**. But it’s such a small amount that there’s really no need for concern. You would have to eat between 20 and 40 pounds of eggplant to consume the amount of nicotine you’d get smoking one cigarette.
* But eggplant had a bad rap before it’s comparison with cigarettes. Ancient Persian philosophers ascribed all kinds of ailments to them – **from pimples to epilepsy**.
* People in the U.K. called them aubergines. The word “aubergine” goes all the way back to the ancient Indian language Sanskrit. The eggplant is believed to have **originated in India**, where it is considered to be the King of Vegetables.
* The word “eggplant” that we use in North America comes from **British-colonized India**, where at the time, a small, white, egg-like variety of the vegetable was all the rage.
* In Renaissance Italy, it was called a mala insana or “**crazy apple**”.
* Japan even has a **proverb** about eggplant:
    “The happiest omen for a New Year is first Mount Fuji, then the falcon, and lastly eggplant.”
No, but I have wondered who decided on ""grapefruit"".We used to grow vegetables for selling at the farmer's market in Madison.  We grew all kinds of eggplants -  white  ones, pink ones, green ones along with the regular purple ones.

When people marveled at the green eggplants, they would invariably ask ""how do you serve them?""

I, of course, would say ""With ham.""You're part eggplant! HAHAHAIt's because they look like eggsi swear when my eggplant grew last year it came out of the leaves purple, and then just grew in size...We call them Aubergines.No, because it's called ""Aubergine"".Outside of America they're called Aubergines or Brinjals.I like the fact everyone in the UK is going ""No. Ive never wondered that because that's not what they're called""I wondered up until about [10 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1eghco/and_thats_why_its_called_an_eggplant/)For anyone wondering, this isn't actually an eggplant.

It's in the same family, but it is a [Solanum ovigerum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum_ovigerum). True eggplants (also known as aubergine) are [Solanum melongina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubergine).

It's grown more as an ornamental than a vegetable crop generally, but the fruits are similarly edible to eggplants (though are higher in solanum-related tropanes and alkaloids like nicotine and scopolamine).Plants should be named for what they look like when they are done growing, not halfway through.

We might as well start calling carrots ""tinypenisplant"".[Her?](http://www.tifaux.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ann-her.jpg)No... because it's an aubergine. Holy shit!  It's all coming together!!  I'm still wondering. Are those eggplants? Why are they white? Why are mine not white?Aubergine!  I always wonder what the yanks meant when they said eggplant... TILNow tell us why they call a carrot a carrot.I did actually, thanks!""Berenjenas"" here in argentina. (Same scientific name, Solanum melongena)

They do not resemble eggs here.

edit: and [here it is in Google Earth](https://www.google.ie/maps/preview/@24.9931203,82.9218758,264826a,35y,350.51h,58.2t/data=!3m1!1e3).So which one is Everest? Obviously from the Outerra engine.

http://i.imgur.com/H9aioNF.jpgEarth is beautiful from above. Welcome to the Himalayas!

Any Monsters Inc. fans?Stupid question time if you don't mind:

Hypothetically, could they get so tall they poke out of the atmosphere? Would that do anything crazy?I think my House may be in this pic.Honestly, I like the photos that enhance natural formations just as much as I like the original photographs. Unfortunately, my mind can't grasp all the dimensions of something so gargantuan in such a tiny photo. Even if the photo is 3192x2124. Sometimes, if done well, enhancing certain aspects to give the formations being photographed more shape allows my mind to fully understand the scale and immense beauty that exists in the real world.

:/Yeah, not so big now are you Himalayas? *shakes fist*Now with political borders defined:

http://i.imgur.com/OvKWWzX.jpgIs it possible to have mountains poke out above the atmosphere on a planet with a surface pressure similar to ours?hahahaha, my ex girlfriend thought the Himalayas where in California.. I told her the nickname for the Himalayas are the Hollywood Hills.The deep gorge that cuts through the range at the bottom right is the Kali Gandaki Gorge, which runs through central Nepal. The western end of Nepal starts near the center of the photo. The southern border essentially straddles the boundary between the mountains and the plain, while the northern border roughly follows the northern end of the snow caps. The noticeable river on the plain is not the Ganges, but the [Ghaghara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaghara), which is one of its major tributaries.

I don't believe Everest can be seen in this photo. It should be just off the right edge.Looks just like the Himalayas on Earth!Honest question...is the white snow or cloud cover?Amazing to see it from outer space, especially as I am currently in Nepal and have a view on some of the range out of my kitchen window!Isn't every picture taken from space?Are we still trying to free Tibet?

We went to this restaurant on Montjuic (the big hill right on the Mediterranean) and we sat a table next to a glass wall where we could look over the entire city at sunset. Easily one of the most breathtaking sights I've witnessed.

Barcelona is very tourist-friendly. Even if you don't speak Spanish or Catalan (some people there actually prefer to speak English to Spanish). I highly recommend travelling there at least once.How good/bad is traffic in Barcelona? Specially this part of the city.Barcelona is such a fabulous city. Thanks to Gaudi, it probably has the most fun architecture in Europe. You sure this isn't Mega City One?Reminds me of the movie Dredd.This remind anyone of the dream scene in inception haha?!?!I wish we had something like this in Spain.[deleted]Oh god I have so strange memories to that city:o This homeless looking man asking me how much it would cost him if I gave him a blowjob... some 80yo man casually opening his shirt and sucking on his nipple while starring at my girlfriend... cops arresting the ladyboy-prostitue who just spit at us, because we declined her offer... damn I miss it!Anyone seeking more info might also check here:

I hope I can return again soon. I lived in this building for a month! Sadly, it ceases to be remotely interesting once you step inside. Such a missed opportunity. I assume it's a bit expensive to rent, so a lot of it is used as short-term corporate housing, which is why I was there. The apartment I was in did not have a balcony (drat) but did have a nice view of Millennium Park.

How would I describe the inside of this building? Beige. I was expecting glossy white James Bond-style stuff, and instead the apartments had the same hideous black-and-tan granite countertops and cherry-stained cabinets as every other apartment, condo and mcmansion of the past 15 years. It was a tremendous letdown.

Was amazing being the first people to do everything in a nice hotel room. Especially since we won't likely be able to afford a place like that again anytime soon.
Also, high-rise naked guy was there then too.
A random naked man standing in the window of a tall building, on a chilly November night... Chicago will always be a unique place in my mind.My brother was a project manager on the construction of this building. He took me to the 80th floor before there were any windows/railings installed, it was awesome. Definitely a great addition to the skyline! (Though I wish it was visible from more angles).[TIL that I spent my entire college education staring at a picture of Aqua, in Chicago. Also TIL that this building is a mixed used structure called Aqua, in Chicago.](http://books.google.com/books?id=oSD7tgAACAAJ&dq=reinforced+concrete+mechanics+and+design&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iPwBU8nnMInqoAT12oGQCQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ)

Everything below is from [meega's](http://www.tikiroom.com/tikicentral/bb/bb_profile.php?mode=view&user=7739) post.


I also tried to hunt down a recipe on the internet, but came up empty-handed except for a few brief desciptions: 

""The pearl part of dessert was made of chocolate mousse, with a shiny chocolate glaze and the shell was baked using almond flour."" 
***** 
""Chocolate Mousse & Passion Fruit Cream in a “Seashell”"" 
***** 
""Chocolate mousse and Liliko'i cream in a pastry seashell"" 
***** 


So here's a start for you cooks out there(minus the Mousse & Glaze so far): 

Liliko'i Cream 
Ingredients 

* 3/4 cup passion fruit purée* 
* 3/4 cup butter 
* 1 cup sugar 
* 12 egg yolks 
* 1 1/2 cups whipping cream 
* 2 pounds brownies*, cut into about 60 cubes (3/4-in.) 
* Chocolate sauce* 

Preparation 

1. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat passion fruit purée and butter over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until simmering. In a medium bowl, whisk sugar and yolks together to form a paste. Slowly add hot liquid, whisking constantly, until combined. Pour mixture into pan and cook, whisking constantly, until it just reaches a simmer around the edges, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a glass or ceramic bowl, cover with a piece of plastic wrap pressed against the curd's surface to prevent a skin from forming, and chill until cold and firm, about 1 1/2 hours. 

2. Using an electric mixer, whisk cream until soft peaks form. Whisk in one-third of the cold curd; then, using a rubber spatula, fold in the remaining curd 

==================== or? =================================== 

LILIKO'I (PASSION FRUIT) ICING 

2 sticks butter 
2 (8 ounce) tubs whipped cream cheese or 
2 (8 ounce) blocks regular cream cheese 
1 cup confectioner's sugar or to taste 
Liliko'i syrup to taste (Recipe below) 

Mix all ingredients in a food processor or with an electric hand mixer. Drop in large `glops' all over the top of cake, letting it run down the sides, but before you do: 

Drizzle the cake with some of the liliko'i syrup, being careful not to drench too much. 

LILIKO'I SYRUP 
Cut passion fruit in half and scoop out pulp and seeds. Pass 
through a fine mesh sieve or squeeze through a couple layers of cheesecloth. 

Add honey or sugar to taste and boil down to half the original amount. When cool, place in a plastic squeeze bottle and keep in refrigerator until needed 


======================================================= 
Almond Wafer Cups 

Ingredients : 

125	gm	almonds, ground 
50	gm	flour, plain 
180	gm	icing sugar 
4	x	egg whites 
1	tbl	water (approx) 

Method : 

* 1.Mix all dry ingredients. Add egg whites and water and mix to a smooth paste. Mixture should not be too runny. 
* 2. Line baking trays with greaseproof paper and spray with non-stick spray. 
* 3. Using a metal spatula form four circles 12cm diameter of mixture of even thickness on the tray. Allow some room for spreading. 
* 4. Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 10 minutes or until golden brown. 
* 5. Working quickly, lift off wafers immediately with a spatula and lay over an inverted mould or cup(or Scallop Shell). Gently press to form into a cup shape. Allow to cool. Store in airtight container until required. 
* *To serve: 
Fill with fruit, ice-cream or your favourite mousse. 
* Unused mixture will keep wrapped in fridge. 
* For that special occasion, these will really impress!

Mama's Fish House in Maui.

One of the best restaurants I have ever been to, if not the best. Expensive, though.I used to work at mamas fish house and when I was on desserts I would make these. The bakers would make the pearl part and the shell earlier in the day and I would just put them on a plate and dress them up. that looks so creepyThat looks expensive as fuck. Polynesian Black Pearl Dessert from Mama's Fish House in Paia, on Maui.  And yes, EVERYONE instagrams one of these.  Here's an example.

JACK!that looks mildly disturbingI usually don't look at redditors usernames. This one caught my attention xDI don't think I could eat it. Too pretty.The only problem with that is that it looks so good you'll feel guilty wrecking it when you start to eat it.Been to Mama's once before. Had the same dessert. The whole meal was fantastic although we waited about an hour for our table. It was of very little consequence to any of us though since the view of the setting sun out front that evening was incomparable. I got a ton of good pictures and then ate until I felt delirious. I think of Maui on my worst days now. Mama's Fish House in Maui? You've seen a dessert with black sails that's crewed by the damned, and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out?10/10 would use to rule the world.         how do you eat it?Is that big mama's fish house in MauiOnly for 24.99$.I'd be scared to eat it, thinking it would pop like a blood blister.

Possibly an airlock.We had a Secret Service agent come to our school and talk about what he did. In the past he said that they built cars and put armour on them, now he says they make armour and then build the car in it.That's because nobody in Britain cares if Cameron gets assassinatedTHE BEAST!

  Thanks for posting OP, it's^been^nice^knowing^you!Thing looks apocalypse proof.the bigger question is why is Cameron wearing such a skinny tie for wide open shirt collar like that.Can you imagine slamming your finger in that door?a little secret about those doors is that to open  the door, the handle must be pulled, pushed, and slide right. 

not the exact order but you get the idea. Its actually styrofoam. The entire car is made out of styrofoam. Fox news even said obama was styrofoam.[""The car that thinks it's a tank.""](http://i.imgur.com/MxpIglu.jpg) They nickname it [""The Beast""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_state_car_\(United_States\)).Yeah, he basically rides around in a Cadillac Tank.One really smart thing Obama did even *before* he was elected to ensure his safety...was to make Biden his running mate. **Nobody** wants to hurt Obama knowing Biden is second in line. what's the MPG on that? can it beat the Prius?[http://i.imgur.com/ayDb6aO.png](http://i.imgur.com/ayDb6aO.png)  [fixed]The President of the US is the most heavily-guarded human on the planet. No king, dictator, or drug lord has better protection. And the Secret Service keeps ratcheting up the level of protection whenever they can, because that increases their status and budget. Although a few Faux News types have hollered about how ""Obama has increased the level of SS protection,"" the office of the President doesn't actually set this level, it comes from the SS, and the current level--including The Beast and the triple Marine One standard--was decided during the Bush administration. Typically, it's the SS that tells the President how they're going to protect him, not vice-versa. Very few Presidents (Ford and Carter come to mind) have vetoed increased SS protection.

The ultimate irony here is that this *insane* (and insanely expensive) level of protection for one politician is pretty much powerless against a lone nut who is willing to trade his life for the President's...and that, coincidentally, is how MOST Presidents get killed. In fact, only Lincoln was the victim of an actual conspiracy...and that was before the bill creating the SS was actually signed.
