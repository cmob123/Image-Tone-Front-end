https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mYBSayCsH0I-I have a confession to make.
I caused the death of spider today and I've not been able to shake the whole ordeal from my head.

You see, I was driving in my car and I see something in my peripheral vision. It's a huge golden orb-weaver. A BANANA SPIDER! He's on my window, the inside, and he's looking at me and I'm looking at him and the cop behind me is looking at both of us and wondering why I'm not driving because the light is now green.

I rolled down my window but that didn't do any good. Spider just hopped down to my arm rest. Too close for comfort. I open my door a little bit but Spider can't take a hint.

WHOOP WHOOOOOOP. The cop is now pulling us over. I turn into a near by parking lot, spider clumsily bolts out of my car via the rolled down window, officer approaches my vehicle and says ""What're you doing, son?!"", I hear a crunch.

That's me in the pic! Check out www.operationthonapa.com for the whole story. Great fun and a crazy trip....never actually thought we would find what we were after Can you imagine spending so much time and energy on this, and then seeing it on the ground and picking it up. Probably a very surreal moment I've been following their [blogging](https://operationthonapa.com/) as they have found different items from the plane, human remains, etc. This is an amazing story to watch unfold and my hat's off to these awesome two dudes. Talk about having a goal and getting it done.

More info on the crash: 
[Eastern Airlines Flight 980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980)Dan Futrell and I (Isaac Stoner) got lost down a rabbit hole on on Wikipedia looking up unrecovered black boxes. Took some serious effort but now there's a smashed up flight recorder on my kitchen counter!  That's the orange box. They need to keep looking.Actually, they found pieces of the casing of the flight recorders, and some loose magnetic tape which, [as they themselves say on their blog](https://operationthonapa.com/31-years-later-we-found-the-flight-recorders-786d0f9fde61), may be nothing more than tape from a passenger's home video.

It's far too early to say they've found anything substantive, regardless of how amazing it is that they've managed to find anything at all.I just got to the part of the blog where they talk about finding crocodile skins all over the debris field, and basically accusing Eastern Airlines of taking part in a crocodile skin smuggling ring. Interesting...maybe they'll end up uncovering more than they bargained for, which is like the beginning of every horror/thriller movie.Why didn't any of the various airplane crash investigative agencies do this?

edit: answered my own question, sort of:  The NTSB did send people but ""because the wreckage was spread over a vast area and covered by 6 to 9 meters of snow, it was not possible for him and his fellow team members to locate either of the ""black boxes.""""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_980#On-site_investigationI set small goals like not losing a sock in the laundry and I can't even accomplish that.I had read their blog as they were doing this. The part where they were finding the human remains and burying them... super powerful stuff man. I teared up a little reading that. Congrats on finding the recorder!That's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. Or a small box in the Andes...Holy shit this is awesome. It makes me want to find another plane crash that has missing black boxes and go find one myself... Talk about bucket list shit.I bet it was the last place they looked.This will be an over dramatized movie, I guarantee it. ""dood we fahkin found the blahk bawx bro""Notice the subtle middle finger in the picture.I feel like they could have found this faster by crashing another plane into the mountain and watching where everything fell.Send these dudes after 370. Was anyone else thinking of the flight that crashed into the Andes mountains in 1972 and everyone had to resort to cannibalism?

Edit 2: Not saying that no other country has their stuff together and so on. Just praising iceland.For historical context, I recommend the Icelandic novel The Atom Station. It gives some background to the cultural attitudes of the polity of Iceland. I don't know about Iceland but we don't read it in schools in the US generally.

That is some serious structural support.Having the washer and drier up there is pretty impressive. This may be the most Texas picture I've ever seen.WEEELLLLL it's floodin' down in Texaaassss.... Never change, East Texas.""Sir, when did you realize it was time to move to the roof?""

""I been here the whole time""I have so many questions.

How did you get a washer and dryer on the roof?

How did you have the time to get all that stuff up there?

Copenhagen or Skoal?Is that you Stevie Ray?What if it rains? Lol there's an American flag or something in his Tupperware tote.  This would be a great find the object picture game.[deleted]This is right down the road from me. Pretty crazy stuff going on down here right now.I thought Texas was a backwards joke until I lived there. TX is likely the 2nd most free place on earth. Don't like it? Vote against it. Done deal. People give you room to be yourself...life has dignity you won't find most places and everyone helps another Texan. Yes, but most roofs aren't rated for any significant live loading. In Texas they probably  don't even plan for a snow load.  It may end all submerged anyway. Are all the telephone lines down?Hopefully no alligators when he sleeps.SETXThis man doesn't have the word victim in his vocabulary, I'm sure he's also missing a lot of other words as well Well at least he has his ps4.

Edit: special edition darth vader one too.It's more like he saved his big ticket items, TV, furniture, electronics.  If you had no other option of saving them, it's worth a last ditch shot.  I also imagine every motel and hotel within 150 miles is full.  So what do you do when you have nowhere to go, and all your stuff is on the roof?  Live on the roof of course.  Someone has to stick around and guard the stuff anyway.Are we positive this isn't Stevie Ray Vaughan?","{'Sadness': 0.10115, 'Emotional_Range': 0.734, 'Tentative': 0.059, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.898902, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.103, 'Agreeableness': 0.742, 'Joy': 0.039401, 'Disgust': 0.07358, 'Extraversion': 0.745, 'Openness': 0.128, 'Anger': 0.721305}",{}

I bet the photographer got a ton of points from Professor Oak for that pic.My mom is obsessed with this animal. It's her profile picture on every social media platform. She makes me call her Pika sometimes and calls me Pika as well. It's confusing.

Edit: [yup](http://i.imgur.com/Hqi7vcb.jpg)I just read about this thing. It's more endangered than the panda. The Chinese call it a Magic Rabbit.>Native to the Xinjiang region of China, there are only 1,000 of these tiny, cute creatures, known as the Ili pika, left.

>Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat further up the mountain peaks.The name of it comes from the name of area where it's found, Ili Prefecture (which is actually a shortened version). 

There's so little information because of how elusive it is so we can't currently determine causes of its endangerment. The area is somewhat mountainous as you can see in the picture, perhaps they just fall off and die or some shit.Pika Pika.Imagine how lucky one of those feet would be... Is this where ""pikachu"" came from? So Ewoks *do* exist!http://imgur.com/G7aBuA8[This](http://i.imgur.com/V5GP1P5.gif) is why they are rarely photographed.

[His Interview with Dan Perez - Vimeo - 5 Minutes](https://vimeo.com/76218172)I am in front of a computer screen.Took me a second to realize there is in fact a bridge above their heads. You are under a bridge.

\>Look

Somebody has painted an abstract mural on it. Two trolls are minding their own business at the north end.

\>Go north. 

The trolls have taken notice of you and draw their weapons. It took me a while to focus my eyes and see the bridge.No Man's BridgeReal Life Monument Valley.I don't ever wanna feel *~~how~~ like* I did that day.

Edit: Derp[@!#?@!](http://i.imgur.com/73mXay6.jpgpLX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/18ez5cvyy88w9jpg.jpg)This image takes me back to the first time I did acid. I was in high school, and the rest of my family was away at some farming convention for the weekend. I was out on the back porch and placed a tab under my tongue. Based on everything I had read and heard, I had done some meditation and relaxation exercises to try and reach as calm and steady a state as possible. I kind of wanted a spiritual sort of experience.

About 45 minutes after I took it, I really started to focus on my breathing. I could feel my skin merging with the air, and everything felt very solid, and whole. Until, that is, I opened my eyes. At that point, the clouds seemed to part, and the sky split open. The sun became a giant pixelated Mario head, and tried to eat me. I ran back inside, but was lucid enough to realize I wasn't okay. I didn't want to risk making a mess of my parents house, so I went back outside and ran straight for the neighbor's house.

They were growing a bunch of egg plants out back. For some reason, I thought the egg plants looked kind of like old-timey bombs, and I felt like I had to disarm them. Of course, this meant picking them all. Their fuses were still burning though, so I did the only thing I could think of: I pissed all over them. It put out the fuses, but the neighbor's wife came running out and beat the shit out of me with a dirty pair of trousers.So, I actually *was* under this bridge a while ago, and for people wondering, it still looks fantastic. People have respected the murals around the city that this artist has done and it really brightens up my day whenever I see one. Compare to Escher: [1](http://www.sciencedump.com/sites/default/files/field/gallery/escher-metamorphose_0.png), [2](http://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/m-c-escher/liberation.jpg)*Looks at photo in awe.* *""Under the Bridge"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers plays in head*If Qbert had been designed by a surrealist painter. 
X/post this to /r/woahdude Thanks for the heads upThis looks like a cover for No Man's Sky 2I never thought I'd see Newburgh on here outside of gang violence.

If you're not familiar with Newburgh, where this and other awesome murals are, this article gives a great understanding on the neighborhood this mural is in:

They do some really cool sculptures! They also carve some insane pumpkins! They're on instagram with different photos and angles of this sculpture.Hey finally I have something interesting to contribute! This was made by my high school art teacher. He's also probably the worlds best pumpkin carver, and got his start doing sculptures for marvel. This is the best! And I don't mean that as a state of opinion, rather as an objective fact.This picture immediately reminded me of one of my favorite books when I was growing up which I had completely forgotten about. Does anyone else remember reading [The Eleventh Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eleventh_Hour_\(children%27s_book\))? Those illustrations and the mystery behind it just made it so much damn fun to read.Is this meant to be Ganesh and his little rat friend?The details of these sand sculptures amaze me. Down to the hair on the elephants head! Amazing The artist that designed and sculpted this was actually my elementary school art teacher, Ray Villafane Before I saw the image, I was trying to figure out how an elephant with giant hooves(?) was going to be able to click the buttons on a tiny mouse.You can even seen little hairs on top of the elephants head. Awesome sculpturePeople are amazing when they are not being dicks!I want this in my houseIs the mouse leaning on his queen? Mac the mouse has no chill.Do they use glues or any kinds of bonding agents in sculptures like these? Because I spy a lot of overhang.Isn't this an Ender's game reference??
Not to speak ill of sands sculpting, but it feels like kid of a shame that it wasn't done in a more permanent medium. It deserves to be preserved.

It also reminds me of this: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2c/cc/a0/2ccca0f375f9ca32816fce049f73f0f4.jpgFor us chess enthusiasts, boy we really want to see the current chess position here.

Really.  No sarcasm or underlying snark.The couple that trips together, stays together.That is crazy, huh? Congratulations to them!
This makes me so ridiculously happy!! My parents had this exact album when I was growing up and played it ALL the time. In fact, it was even the background soundtrack at my Dad's memorial service. I spoke of his die-hard hippie spirit and all he'd imbued upon us. God damn hippies ruining the nuclear family of America! Man they've probably been through some shit together, and by shit I mean wild hippy orgys and swinger romps.This is really nice. My parents and the 2 other couples that they went to Woodstock with are all still together. They are all still best friends as well. They have known each other since high school and still get together almost every other week. My mom speaks to the 2 other women on the phone probably every day. I have been on multiple family vacations with all of them from when I was very young through my late teens. I have been to all of their kids weddings and they were at mine. It's a nice story about a Bunch of kids from the Bronx that life turned out pretty nice for. The most beautiful thing is not only are they still together, they're still smiling.
Staying married to the same person for decades is harder than it looks.I didn't even know the Woz was married LSD in the 60s and a lifetime of proper fucking will plant a permanent grin on your face.

And if you're in Durham, NC he has a show up right now at the Nasher Museum (but no Woodstock photos there) http://nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions/uzzle/I'm so alone.

EDIT: To make this less of an awful comment, [here's a photo I took when I covered Eaux Claires last year](http://i.imgur.com/YDfpYAw.jpg). I love seeing moments like these...when two people are so intimate and comfortable with each other. I live vicariously through those glimpses of happiness.

EDIT EDIT: Here's [another one from the same festival](http://i.imgur.com/QeFQ612.jpg). I was shooting The National, and during their song 'I Need My Girl' this guy next to me turned around, got down on one knee, and proposed to his girlfriend. This is almost directly after (I let them have their moment obviously, she was sobbing!) and then I asked their permission to take it. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to ask their names, so I'm hoping someday someone recognizes them. I mean look at his face. That is happiness.She was my elementary school nurse and I went to school with both their sons. They are really great people.  They had a cockatoo that was a fucking dick that would attack people though. 

Edit: bad grammar

Edit 2 : I hate these posts,  these are two really great people that have had successful careers and raised 2 great guy's.

It is a real stone, it is my stone, I took the photo and the video, and the reason the video is taken from only one angle is because it is the only angle in the right light that captured the colours. Any other angle you would see only black lattice.

This gem is now becoming available again.
I discovered it back in 1985 with a friend and now we are mining starting to mine and process it.

This is in Milan, Italy 
  
> Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) is a pair of residential towers in the Porta Nuova district of Milan, Italy, between Via Gaetano de Castillia and Via Federico Confalonieri near Milano Porta Garibaldi railway station. They have a height of 110 metres (360 ft) and 76 metres (249 ft) and will host more than 900 trees (approximately 550 and 350 trees in the first and second towers respectively) on 8,900 square metres (96,000 sq ft) of terraces. Within the complex is also an 11-story office building; its facade does not host plants.

> The towers were designed by Boeri Studio (Stefano Boeri,Gianandrea Barreca and Giovanni La Varra). It also involved input from horticulturalists and botanists.Any civil engineers here have some insight to how this works in the long term?

As far as I know, roots don't give a fuck about concrete and will just grow straight through it. I'm assuming they do something to prevent this, maybe metal instead etc. That's gotta be a bitch to maintain honestly. hanging gardens have been built in a far away land! Dude, vertical forest.

COOL, BUT WHERE DO THE ROOTS GO?!with all evergreen plantings and decent amount of moisture in the air. this is a wonderful way to improve quality of life, create wildlife habitat and keep the building cool. im sure they have pre approved plants and something similar to a windowwashing team that comes and does maintenance.Here is another similar [forest mid-rise in Torino, Italy](http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5502/126b/e58e/ce81/2900/01d3/large_jpg/%C2%A9bg_25Verde_017.jpg?1426199141).

a few weeks later my friend, the guy who shipped the dead armadillo, got very ill and was in the hospital for a couple weeks with some kind of stomach infection that descended further into his digestive tract. he had to have part of his intestines removed and was touch and go for a bit in the hospital.

How do the waffles taste with home-field advantage?Belgian here. The sugared waffle and strawberry combo you'll be able to find at pretty much every local market. Most will have a waffle stand.

Places to see when visiting:

* Ypres and the entirety of the 'Westhoek' especially nowadays with the 100 year anniversary of WW1. There are plenty of memorial sites here so you might even find a family member. Well preserved remnants of trenches, and some very nice museums.

* While you're in this area the coast isn't too long of a drive. It's a huge tourist trap but if you want try Belgian mussels then you'll find the best on the coast. All sorts of freshly caught fish and seafood can be bought on the dike at around 4-5 pm in the afternoon, when the boats come back in.

* Some of our cities have a very rich history. Brussels, Ghent and Antwerp for example were economical powerhouses in the medieval times and you still get to visit old guild houses and the like. Tongeren on the other hand is the oldest Belgian city and dates back to Roman times. Tongeren has a nice Gallo-Roman museum that sheds light on both cultures living together and merging within Belgian borders.

Local cuisine to try out. Most of it has a very countryside and homely feel to it.

* 'French' fries. Really, these things are Belgian and every town will have at least a few 'frietkoten', places that specialize in only selling French fries and other deep-fried stuff that goes with it. I recommend asking the locals for a good place. It's tough to find a place that sucks but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference in quality.

* Chocolate. If you find a chocolate shop you should definitely go and buy some real Belgian pralines. High price, but worth experiencing.

* Mussels. Best place to order this is obviously the coast, so you're guaranteed they're as fresh as can be. Most often served with fries, a bit of mayonnaise, and a special sauce just for the mussels. The mussels are basically cooked in a stewy vegetable soup with lots of spices. Shrimp are also a very loved local seafood.

* Beef carbonnade, locally known as 'stoofvlees'. I personally dislike it but most Belgians freaking love it. The sauce is often prepared with some heavy beer like a Trappiste or Tripel.

* On that note, the beer. There's a huge variety here. Some people love Jupiler, others the heavier Duvel. We have all sorts of white, blonde, and dark beers as well as fruity 'chick' beers. I'm not much of a beer guy myself but I fucking love a cold Stella Artois. Some places especially in the city will specialize in serving as many different beers as possible and they'll even serve them in the correct glass. Worth asking around if there's such a place where you're visiting. You can drink an afternoon away just exploring tastes if you're not careful.

* Other stuff I can't be bothered to describe anymore: *waterzooi, paling in't groen, pensen, ...*

* My personal favourite: *kiekerenbloed*, literally chicken's blood, which is exactly the main ingredient. It's a *very* local dish that's made by (as far as I know) mixing chicken's blood with bacon grease and baking it, then serving it with a sandwich and a dollop of mustard.

specially since Brugge became champion in footballNo joke, I ate at this same place in Bruge, same table yesterday. I knew my user name would come in handy one day. Nice to see a picture of what Belgium is really like instead of the dangerous war zone the media has been portraying it as recently. I had a muffin from Costco this morning with coffee that got cold because I had to hold my newborn while my wife ate her muffin. BEAT THAT ASSHOLESince youre in Belgium, I take it that would be just a waffle then, eh??That's nothing but sugar. And caffeine from the espresso. I prefer the German way of meats and cheeses, need that morning protein.And here we see a nice neighborhood within the walls of Isengard.Something about it reminds me of the one scene in Inception.*sigh* Europe is so beautiful. [deleted]Would make a nice oil paintingI had the same view and the same breakfast some years ago.  
Thank you for sharing this picture which reminded me of simpler times. I would move to Belgium in a Minute, if I could stay there for the rest of my life, I love the whole country and everything in it.

If you are blind sorry you can't read this it is pretty funny.As a deaf person, I can only understand about half of what that drummer has to say.They have a heated rivalry with the nearby Arkansas School for the Blind Melons. The whole irony of this is brutally amazing. Meeting rock legends with the same name as their mascot, but not being able to hear what makes them legends. It's so fucked up that it's hilarious.

I put some catnip in there, in the hopes they'd leave the other stuff alone. Sadly, they weren't super attracted to it. Then one day I cut off a few bruised leaves. I threw the leaves at a cat and the lil bugger went crazy. It looked at me like ""WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY DIDN'T I KNOW ABOUT THIS?"" A bunch of other feral cats heard the commotion and came over. Obviously they wanted some too. Now whenever the cats see me, they run up and meow, begging for a little hit of the good stuff.

Fox did something similar.I was taking my dog for a walk the other day, and this is his first full summer so he really hasn't seen fireflies I don't think. Anyways, one flashed in front of him, so he did what he normally does and snapped it up and ate it. Well, it should be said that he is a pretty drooly little boy, and you could actually see bits of glowing firefly in his drool.

There was about 6 to 8 firelfies in the jar total. I am a little surprised myself at this final image.It blows my mind a little every time I'm reminded that fireflies/lightningbugs are a real thing that exists in the world. It's like finding out Santa is real.I sat out on the back porch this past weekend for a little bit and watched the lightning bugs flair in the dark. It was a lot more relaxing than I would have imagined. Also, that's a lot of fuggin' bugs in that jar, man. How did you collect them?3 minutes? What was your ISO at? It's so noisy it looks like the ISO would be jacked up which (let alone the 3 minute exposure) would blow everything out, right? How is this just not a white image?Not a streak or blur in 3 minutes? Are you sure you didn't just stack your timelapse exposures?When my grandfather was a kid, him and his friends would catch a bunch of fire flies in brown paper bags, then go to the local ""picture show"" and release them so there were fire flies all up in the movie theater.Very cool, wish we had fireflies in FloridaThe noise in the picture makes it look like a quick render in blender.Beautiful!!

but you can't take the sky from meI like that you mentioned that you let them go afterwards. Many (most?) people don't think that tiny lives are worth saving and it's nice to see you be like ""Don't worry, they're ok!""

Any idea how many were in the jar? I can't decide if that's a shitton of fireflies or if it was just a few who were moving around a whole lot.I feel terrible about the wiffle bat genocide I inflicted on these little guys when I was a kid.  I don't kill bugs anymore (on purpose), but somebody should have smacked the shit out of me for that.Anyone else think Alice in chains and their Jar of flies album?

It's cafeteria in TCS, an IT company. Many companies display such data in the cafeterias.We did this at my summer camp to make kids aware of food wastefulness and not taking more than they'd eat. Went from over 150 lbs of wasted food the first day down to 45 by the end of camp. Guess they're also serving up guilt there.Near me there are a few ""All You Can Eat Sushi"" spots.

They will not serve you more until you clear everything on your plate. If you don't eat everything that came out, you can't order more. You also can't take it home.

This actually pissed me off the one time I went there with some people a while back. They make you order as a table. I'm very specific with sushi, so I ordered 2 or 3 specific rolls for myself, but when I finished they wouldn't let me order more because the table wasn't finished.

You see, the other people at my table were ... well ... idiots. They thought, ""Hey, it's all you can eat! Lets just order everything, even the stuff that doesn't sound appealing!"". 

They ordered more food than anyone could eat, didn't end up finishing it, and as a result I couldn't order more. I even asked the waitress if I could go on my own separate bill, to which they said, ""One table, one bill"".

They wasted a ton of food that night, and I was probably the only person in the history of an ""all you can eat"" restaurant who went home hungry.250g doesn't sound like a particularly big meal for those 180 peopleTata Consultancy Services. Our motto: ""I'm not a doctor, but I'll take a look.""You sure this is a restaurant? Looks more like an office cafeteria [deleted]In general,  the solution would be to switch to smaller plates. People are lazy and they will avoid doing many trips to the bar. That is the ugliest number 5 I've ever seen. Fuck I'm tired. I originally saw wastage and thought that this was written in German or something However, that wouldnt have actually fed anyone. It instead saves the company money and gives them more profit. They are playing on your emotions for their gain.

Im a little cranky this morning apparently lol.[In other words: Don't do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCLXZmMQNs)i know some all you can eat places get around this by charging a fee if your plate isnt empty when you ask for the bill. which i think is perfectly acceptable, wasting food is a shame. 

edit: to the people whining, or saying what if i have 1 shrimp on my plate, use some common sense people. if you have a few small items, or stuff half eaten cause you didn't like it you wont be charged normally. it's the people who've had 3 plates are pretty full but think they can do one more round fill a plate and leave it half full. 

and to the people saying how do they charge you for it? well buffets are a set price, when your bill comes there will be a fee on top, it's not rocket science.. I wonder if this is 100% actual foods that you could have actually fed 180 people with or if they just weighed the waste bin... It's ironic this is a sign at Tata. Fuck this company and everything it stands for.But is it gonna feed 180 people, if it wasn't wasted? What are they gonna do with leftovers at the end of the day?A retaurant in my town makes you pay double if they see you wasting too much food. If you don't pay, they kick you out. Not like we would waste anything on the first place, but there will always be assholes.We did a similar thing when I went to school. The cafeteria had a clear tube that red balls were placed in for every x kilo thrown in the waste baskets. There was also a mark on the tube, and if we were lower than the mark by the end of the year, everyone would get ice cream.Do they weigh just the edible waste or are they including bones and shells?  If the former, who's separating these?  They should also post their profit for full transparencyTCS...   the sweatshop of the consultancy world...Buffet by definition is wasteful, they can take their side order of guilt and shove it. I wonder how effective this sign is...I love the ""do it for the environment"" or ""do it for starving people"" marketing...when it is really ""do it so that we can reduce our costs"".

So is it travertine or marble?how ""gripy"" is resin? like if you were to try to slide a glass across the table would it grip to the table?What kind of resin is that? 

I need to know. For reasons. Please.This is a lot like Greg Klassen's tables in wood and glass. I think Klassen's work is, overall, nicer looking though. It also involves more work to cut the glass to match the curves:

There are some other artists who do this too, whose names escape me at the moment, including at least one who does it with thicker pieces of glass, 3D shaped along the entire thickness of the table.Kindof ugly.

[Shore breaks](https://youtu.be/EUXOZAinUPk)  
Other interesting facts about shore breaks.  
EDIT: Being from Hawaii I've thankfully learned how to duck dive under any wave, especially shorebreaks. As the name of the wave suggests, a shore break is a wave that breaks obviously close to shore. In my years of living in Hawaii I've probably seen a dozen of deaths because they either don't duck dive and get slammed from the peak down towards the sand or worse, rocks and reef. Another reason people die is that they stand at the bottom of the peak and get slammed with pounds of water causing back injuries or worse paralysis. It is fun to bodyboard or bodysurf these types of waves, however do it at your own risk. Learn to duck dive, never be afraid of a wave again.YEEZY YEEZY WHAT'S GOODI made this video piece about Clark a couple years ago, if anyone's interested in knowing a little more.

https://localwiki.org/hsl/Camp_Topridge

Now that's what I'm Tolkien about.Honestly, I think that's just a boat house. Or a boat house with a guest cabin. Also known as the Adirondack Architectural style. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Architecture [I knew i'd seen this house somewhere before - Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yO6BgrnXcA&t=14m48s)House of Cirdan, the Shipwright.That woodwork is on pointde_lakeThat's a boathouse, not a ""private marina"".Looks like the Adirondacks.This definitely reminds me of the one of the inns in WoW. It's been years so I don't remember its name but it was in the level 10ish+ area near Darnassus.

Edit: I believe it is Auberdine that I am thinking of.But would you live there rent free if you had to give up Facebook? [Let me set the mood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yLjsWTNeE)If my hunt-and-seek games have taught me anything, there's a hidden microfiche in that house, and the boathouse has a spear, a starfish, a watering can, an umbrella, a mirror compact, a kitten, a  fish hook, three scarves, a TV remote, a flowered headband, a baby's rattle, and two pieces of a torn up photo in it.Honest question. What happens if the water level rose/dropped say 5-10 feet? I don't know about this area but around here thats pretty common throughout the year. Does the house float up to compensate? Is nothing kept on the lower level with the dock and they just let that flood? What if it rises over that level? Just curious if anyone knows.I work in this area often. This is Camp Topbridge on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondack Park of NY State. I turned in a quest there once where I had to kill 10 diseased boars.This is no mansion, it's a boathouse. Also a marina is a yacht mooring or harbor, this is probably suitable for a very small uncovered powerboat at most and, more likely, serves primarily to house paddle boats of various kinds.Oh to have money...I see the house in When Marnie Was There.

Concise and accurate. Excellent marketing.If anyone is wondering what patch he is wearing, it's the patch of the 3rd Armored Division(Tank Division)Interesting that Minnie has a hairstyle suited to the 20s and 30s. Kinda like our grandma's nowadays have hairstyles from the 50s and 60s. Man, Elvis was a damn stud.Elvis is the coolest motherfucker there ever was.

A box of... premiums.Pretty sure that's Ray Liotta Elvis guy here.

What strikes me is how modest the setting here is.  At this point Elvis was the biggest name in the world, with multiple #1 records and hit movies. He was already a pioneer in music (with several ""first"" concept albums already done) and basically the most famous entertainer in the world.

By 1959, Elvis beloved mama was dead and Vernon had already remarried (a woman who quickly asserted herself as the new matriarch of the family, much to Elvis' displeasure. She and Vernon lived in GRaceland with Elvis for a time but after she rearranged the furniture and changed the drapes, which Gladys had picked out, Elvis moved all her stuff out and sent her down the road to live with Vernon in a nearby house).


It's unclear to me where this picture was taken but it doesn't appear to be Graceland. The house changed a lot between 57-77 but this doesn't look anything I've seen. It may be Vernonshouse.

The point is, despite already having an obscene amount of money and a willingness to spend it freely on his loved ones, the  environment here is still so modest. It's partially because of the era and partially because. Elvis' family grew up so dirt poor that even this was considered a significant step up.Christ he's photogenic isn't he?Her head looks way too small for her body.

I bet a lot of people had a great deal of fun at that drive-in.First thing I thought looking at that is WiFi signal bars..I love seeing nature take back its land.I remember watching the movie Twister at the drive-in up north MI cherry bowl. So many memories going up there each summer.I wonder how many people were conceived there.I find it interesting that the only place the forest made inroads is right up by the screen.  My guess is that the fanned out area where cars used to park to see the movie is somewhat contaminated from oil and exhaust from cars, making that ground less fertile.  In fact, I see that bushes are growing in the car-park area, but in distinct lines, probably where cars didn't park or drive.
Where is this??The last movie I saw at a drive in was a double feature. Free Willy, and The Fugitive. Man I remember going to these :\

CEDAR FALLS (KWWL) -
The University of Northern Iowa Police Department are asking for your help for information regarding the whereabouts of Adam Sailor.

>Sailor was expected to participate in commencement ceremonies today but failed to attend.

>He is around 5 9 tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds.

>If you have information regarding Sailor or where he is located please call UNI Police Department immediately. 

>UNI Police Department: 319-273-2712Wait why was she flying in? Graduation is only a few days after finalsThanks for David Johnson!Fellow native Iowan here, glad to see my home state on the front page for some reason other than the primaries...This is why you can't say *all* of the education system in America is bad.ITT: Iowans getting stoked about finding other Iowans on Reddit.

Note: I too am from Iowa. I've been in the UNIdome many times. 
UNI is great - I just finished up my first year, and I love it. From the administration to students, it feels very tight-knit. I have the opportunity to work with administrators, and they genuinely care about students. Once in a while the president (Bill Ruud, at the left podium) will just wander around the union and talk to people, he invited student government to his house. A couple weeks ago the Provost (Jim Wohlpart, on the right podium) came to one of the student senate meetings, and we had a great discussion with him. 

And he signs his emails with an interesting signature, ""Awe & Wonder"".
Honestly that really considerate of them.

At my graduation the women's lacrosse team was away at some championship game and came two hours late, and the faculty tried to make everyone stay. People were getting restless and tried to leave but they would get up and tell the students that it was mandatory to stay. 

Eventually they got there, instead of lining up and getting their diplomas they wanted their names called one by one so they could make a grand entrance and high-five people. They got booed instantly.Is the ceremony so important? I mean... I'm in Europe, but when my graduation ceremony was organized I had already moved to another city and started working, so I just declined the invitation. 

It's just an event, as far as I know :3Was surprised seeing UNI on Reddit... I completed my Master's there. I never thought I'd end up in Iowa, but can't think of a bad thing to say about UNI or Cedar Falls.

Except the -40 degree wind chills. Fuck those.Isn't UNI the school that gave us The Interlude dance a few years back?  
God bless that campus. /r/iowa

Kamerick is my grand dad.I challenge *anyone* to name a group of people nicer than the god damn Iowans! UNI is a stand up university. Wow! The president of my school left as soon as she finished giving the opening address! Must be nice...As an Iowan, UNI (University of Norther Iowa) is used quite a bit.

I feel  like my Alma Mater would have found a way to charge me money or withhold my degree for missing mine.UNI Fight!Wow reading the title I thought maybe they delayed the graduation for 45 minutes and I was like wow that's very nice, but I feel the pain for the audience having sat through a lot of graduations myself. They are very long and grueling for the audience. Although they stayed 45 minutes AFTER the whole ceremony huge props to them. That's insane. Am I crazy or is 45 minutes not that long to wait?

This fucking guy layed down in the patchiest, dirtiest piece of land and pinned us down. 4 of us could not find him. We KNEW here was there because the goddamn grass kept shooting at us. But we couldn't figure out which patch of grass it was, or what part of that patch was him.

One time I was trying to sneak up on a small herd of deer that were hanging around in a field by the highway. I got really close, when suddenly this car pulls over, and the driver gets out. He slammed his door, which scared the deer away. :(

He also apparently pulled over to take a leak, and thought the small grassy outcropping was a good target to piss on. I was a good spy. I never compromised my position.I completely missed the other two snipers in the background.This reminds me of a time I had a sleepover with a friend who insisted to stay the night.

[This blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/) explains the whole story. 

Today (by co-incidence) there was a [follow-up post](http://digileaders.com/ok-think-loud-organisational-culture/) with some other thoughts.

To answer a few of the questions I've seen in the thread:

* I work at the UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) and yes, we are hiring
* yes this is real
* no, there was no input from Human Resources or from senior management
* we did it because we work in an organisation where doing things like this is ok
* it's not aspirational; this is a list of things newcomers need to know about how things already are
* yes that's our office building in central London, but we share the building with other organisations so it's not all ours
* the poster mentions Slack because Slack is one of the tools we use to get stuff done; we use many other tools too :)
* as others have pointed out, there's a print-your-own PDF linked from [the original blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/), so if you'd like to put a copy up on your wall, you can

> stay home when you feel ill

I wish more people did this. I work in a large building with a lot of employees. They'll cough, sniffle, sneeze, wipe their nose and just generally leak. 

It's gross, and you're not a 'trooper"" for working when you're sick, you're putting me at risk of catching whatever nasty-ass shit you've caught.

Stay home and rest - don't make the rest of us have what you have.

EDIT: of course this only applies to companies that give you sick time![Picture of the boss.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yHJVlf-SLgg/UjSxTIsZR6I/AAAAAAAAAPs/DbeAaLDZ18k/s1600/office-space-lazy-mode.png)This would only encourage me to work harder and be more loyal to the company. No, it's bloody well not okay to sing at work. Not everyone has a pleasant voice. This only works with people who *want* to work. The kind of people who want their work to always be top notch because they feel it's a reflection of them as a person. If you happen to find the rare office full of these people, then these kinds of policies provide the necessary freedom for the job to get done the most efficiently and at the highest quality.

In the countless offices and jobs where people are just there to collect a check, this absolutely does not work. And I'm not necessarily always blaming the employees. Some jobs are just shit and no one would ever *want* to work it. It just is what it is sometimes.Plot twist: This is an ad for Slack.Where I work the list would fit on a sticky note.

It's ok to......work, because that's what I'm paying you for. Now get back to work and stop wasting my money reading notes on the wall.Employees can be treated like people? I didn't know that was an option.I like the ""not check your email out of hours"" bit.

Nothing pisses me off more than getting hounded for not responding to emails, when I haven't had a chance to check them.

*walk into office*

""Hey, you never responded to my email.""

""When did you send it?""

""Last night, at around 7pm.""

""....correct, I didn't respond. I wasn't working at that time.""

*fast forward when someone complains about it*

""Part of your job expectation is that you check your email and respond promptly.""

""Okay, then show me that clause in my contract. Because I'm pretty sure my contract states that I'm supposed to do my job well, as instructed, and on time. Now if you want to add a 'must check email every few hours' clause to that contract, by all means, go for it; but, it better be accompanied by a higher wage.""

&nbsp;

Aaaaaaaand, while I'm on this rant:

""Hey, I'm still waiting on a response to that email I sent you.""

""You mean the email asking me <insert random question>?""

""Yes""

""Well, we had a one-on-one meeting about it. And *then,* the next day, you asked me about it in person again. I considered the question to be answered (twice) at that point. So no, I did not respond to the email (outside of work hours), because I considered it to be a waste of my time.""

""Well, I need written confirmation from you.""

""That's absolutely understandable, but if that's the case, DON'T FUCKING ASK ME ABOUT IT - *TWICE* - IN PERSON. Or at least have the forethought to say: ""hey, I know we already talked about this, but I'd just like written confirmation."" That's a little better - BIT EVEN SO: if you really need the written confirmation, then don't bother with the in-person questions. Send an email. Ask questions. Get answers. Boom - written confirmation, and we've both only had to address this issue one time. That means that we're not getting paid to waste time, and I'm not slowly hating you for asking the same question multiple times.

&nbsp;

Sorry guys - I could go on and on and on about this. Apparently I ""have a reputation for not responding to emails,"" and it just blows my mind. No one at my office seems to agree with my rules, which are as follows:

1) If you send an email during off-hours, expect a response during on-hours. 

2) If it is urgent, and cannot wait, call me. Even if it's to say ""hey, I know it's 8pm on a Saturday, but there's a serious situation that needs addressing. Are you available to check your email?""

3) If you ask me a question in person, do not ask me the same question in an email, unless you at least acknowledge that it is a follow up, and you just need confirmation.

Work hours are work hours. Off hours are off hours. I'm perfectly willing to spend some off-hours working from time to time, as it's something we all have to do now and then; however, do not expect me to be glued to my email, as if I have nothing better to do than to work for you while not getting paid.

&nbsp;

FUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKK

&nbsp; 

EDIT: Whoa! I don't know if this qualifies as ""RIP inbox,"" but I surely did not expect this many replies! A couple of responses that may put things into context:

&nbsp;

1) This is not a salaried position. I freelance (to an extent), so these are part-time office hours at this company. I *absolutely* agree that, if I were salaried here, then I should be less hostile about unnecessary emails, and way more appreciative of that fact that I'm pulling in a decent annual, completely stable and reliable income. 

2) Although I *do* believe in everything I said, and stand by it, I'm not really this hostile at the workplace. In comes Reddit, where I can enjoy writing up a fiery rant - the type that I would never actually display at the office (although I have made these opinions known, diplomatically)

3) Given that I really provided no information as to what I do, where I do it, or what my office situation is like, I totally sympathize with those of you who think I just hate my job, suck at it, don't put in any extra effort, and won't ""climb the ladder,"" (so to speak); however, it's probably worth noting that I have a fantastic relationship with my supervisors and coworkers, and though I have this reputation about emails, I also have a reputation for doing far more work than is required (and happily so, because I *do* believe in the company and its overall goals), as well as a reputation of going out of my way to help guide other workers in how to do their jobs more effectively. I love my job, but it is a small company, and because I believe in it, it sometimes feels like a full time gig - without the benefits. Perhaps that is why I get a little snarky about off-hours emails.

4) Lastly, the head of the company has almost always taken my side in this issue, and has complained to managers about sending six emails that could be consolidated into one, as well as trying to limit emails to office hours (when it's not an emergency). This was meant to be more of a Lewis Black style ""let me rant about this small thing!,"" rather than a ""my company is absolute shit for doing this to me."" (That being said, again, I stand by my reactions!)

&nbsp;

SECOND EDIT: and my gold cherry has been popped, it would seem. Obligatory thanks, kind strangerSeeing this makes me feel happy knowing that there are good employers out there, and simultaneously sad that I work in an exploitative hell-hole where most of the things on this list are *not* ok.Lots of people asking where this is, are they hiring, or saying it's made up...

It's from the team at the UK's Government Digital Service. 

https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/Judging by the comments here, inclusive workplaces aren't as common as I thought.  This is just basic respect for your employees, I'm bummed a lot of people think this is a weird idea.


Edit:  To clarify, I'm bummed that people are forced to work at places that reward presenteeism and conformity, as I was naiively under the impression that more workplaces understood that those aren't the best ways to get optimal results from your employees.  I wasn't saying that you're all fascists or a part of a major problem if this way of working is new to you.  There used to be a course on EdX by Catalyst about this kind of thing that is probably still available for audit if anyone is interested.Are they hiring?Irony - most people are reading this on Reddit at work.That looks like a cool building!The only explanation. They grow marijuana. Well this makes me sad about my job even more. Serious question. Am I the only one who wonders if I'm lazy, or just want more from my job than just a paycheck? Or am I alone in this one?file under: notes i'll never see at my jobit's ok to....

You'll notice that every small plane points opposite to the large excitation of the planar field; if you add up the planar vectors of all small individual planes, they will always be equal and opposite to the larger planar excitation.Some one call Nikon, they'll love this.

Turns out he was a dormant egg from the previous year and was in rough shape when we found him. His eye was all swollen shut. We actually put him in a small water hole the first time we saw him, then next weekend we found him in the same spot, that's when we brought him home. Named him ""One Eye'd Willie"", but he goes by Willie now, or sometimes Will dog.

Here he is climbing!
http://imgur.com/LwY5QfLhttp://i.imgur.com/WnyJ9u9.jpgWhat is that, a turtle for ants? I'm so sad today. I'm going to tell a horrible story.

I work as a mail carrier, and today I saw this HUGE turtle in the road, on a fairly busy road actually. So I put my mail in my bag and go to rescue him, all of the cars were changing lanes to avoid him (it was a two lane one way). I go in to grab him, and this white car comes up and isn't paying attention. He's texting and he doesn't change lanes.

I was one foot away from my turtle friend when he hits him going 45. Ruining my big little friend. He didn't die, but his body was torn in half and his shell was crushed. He lifted his head in agony and my heart broke. I'm a 25 year old man and I cried while I stood there. I couldn't save my friend from his fate.

Another car comes down within a minute or two and finishes him off. This time I was relieved he was no longer in pain.

I've seen it all, but today was a especially bad day.Definitely post that here too: https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyanimalsonfingersI LIKE ^^^TUTTLESThere were two at my work a while back!

May your future be rich in lanolin lotion.[deleted]PSA: When you find a turtle on the road always help it in the direction it's going even if there's a pond behind them. They're going in that direction for a reason. My boyfriend is obsessed with what he refers to as ""Wee turtles"" 

When he saw this, he made the most adorable noises, so thank you for that, OP. Awww! My boyfriend saw [this little guy](http://imgur.com/PnxuC9c) in the road a few weeks ago.

No really though this is the most impressive thing I've seen in forever.Senator Franken is sharp as anything, and actually an excellent senator.

Storytime: My mother was (recently retired) a teacher. She met the Senator about five, six years back when he came to her school to talk to the kids. He actually drew one of these in front of them as he talked. He then spent some time in the teacher's lounge talking to my mom. At the time, my father was in the process of dying of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, which they discussed.

He met her again a few years later, and asked after him (by name, mentioning the disease - didn't just file it away under ""random teacher - sick husband""), and gave his condolences. He remembered that shit the whole time, after one meeting. Didn't need to - he had her vote to begin with and he knew it - he's just got a memory like a freaking vice.

Their babies are lain in clutches and then promptly forgotten (though even to say that they are forgotten is incorrect, since forgetting requires some initial presence of mind: in truth this tortoise has perhaps never been truly aware [in the human sense] of what exactly its instincts force it to do). There is no plausible scenario in which those little tortoises would possibly find themselves on top of their mother: first because they are tiny and second because their mother is no more significant to them than a pile of dirt or a largish chunk of granite. In fact it is in the baby tortoises' best interest to stay away from their mother since (as I said before) the mother has no maternal instinct whatsoever and could easily and inadvertently crush them underfoot or knock them on their backs or harm them in some other way (the chance of this happening is admittedly pretty slim, but there is certainly a greater chance that the mother will hurt them rather then help them [which {I pray I have made abundantly clear} is exactly zero since tortoises have no maternal instincts whatsoever]). This is anthropomorphising at its worst and images like this that actively misinform people through implication are no different than any other kind of clickbait in that they convolute a genuinely interesting subject by (rather than putting forth the effort required to present something both interesting and informative) simply slapping an eye-catching title on a misleading image.

The play event in the middle, a spring rider, is classified as a ""sitting-rocking motion event"", and as such, has a 6' ""use zone"" around it, in which no other play events can be located. It looks to me like that's a 13'x15' space or so, so *just* big enough to accommodate this thing. Furthermore, they wanted accessible seating and trash disposal, meaning you need wheelchair-traversible surfacing all the way around both features (the bench and bin). Finally, at that point they probably live in a place that requires fencing around non-supervised play areas, so naturally to save money, they made it as small as possible. Honestly, you see shit like this all the time, where people don't understand the cost and rules of commercial play equipment.

So by law in that county or city or state, not sure which, registered sex offenders couldn't live within a certain area of the park. This also applied to schools, daycares or any other places kids meet. So any of the registered sex offenders had to move.

In summer 2013, Sparky was struck by lightning on his shoulder hump.

> While doing a survey of bison on the refuge in late July 2013, Wildlife Biologist Karen Viste-Sparkman noticed a bull standing by himself. On closer inspection, it was clear that he had been struck by lightning and burned over a large area of his body. Sparky was thin after the strike and wasn't expected to live long. Since a lightning strike is something that could happen to wild bison anywhere, the refuge let nature take its course. But two years later, Sparky is going strong!

> Sparky is just one of the bison that call[ Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge](http://www.fws.gov/refuge/neal_smith/) home. The refuge was established to protect, restore, reconstruct and manage the diverse native ecosystems of tallgrass prairie, oak savanna and sedge meadow. As part of that mission, Neal Smith has a small herd of bison.

Well done Sparky!

[""Negro tenant farmer, rehabilitation client. Jefferson County, Kansas"", 1938.](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/fsa1997003700/PP/)


From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration):


>Initially created as the Resettlement Administration (RA) in 1935 as part of the New Deal in the United States, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) was an effort during the Depression to combat American rural poverty.


>The FSA stressed ""rural rehabilitation"" efforts to improve the lifestyle of sharecroppers, tenants, very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture  that is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.

Can't help but think of Rainbow Six Siege.I did a Google Image search on the image and it took me to the MET and an exhibit on crime they're doing, but couldn't find exactly what this was from. My first thought, with the year 1975, was that it could be an image from a heist that the SLA did. They were famous for kidnapping and brainwashing Patty Hearst. Here's the famous image of that: http://foundsf.org/images/8/88/Polbhem1$patty-hearst-and-sla.jpg

They're a fun read on Wikipedia, but I'd love to know a source for this otherwise.I've seen this before. Shortly after the robbery he used this photo as the cover as his mix-vinyl. I love that even in 1973, the bank robbers were still trying to look good.He might be from the '70s, but that suit sure wasn't.Reminds me of Dog Day Afternoon pro tip; shooting out the lens doesn't make the camera inoperable.I've never understood this idea: in order to get the shot, you probably to have to look at the camera and give it a good shot of your face. Shooting the camera doesn't get rid of the footage, so what's the point?They still wore hats in the 70s?This website says it was ""shot"" in Cleveland in 1975, but I really think it might have been much earlier judging by the clothing.

The only thing was I thought cameras were not used widely in banks before the 70s, but then I found this:

Sure enough, the earliest robbers caught on camera were from a bank in Cleveland in 1957 although it looks like a different incident./r/oldschoolcoolMy new album cover for my band. Looks badass thoWhere is this from?Bill Murray looks different than I remember. I guess without the clown makeup...No way this is 1975. No one wore Fedoras in1975Not saying it's not 1975, but...those are not 1975 clothes.  More like 1955.

Also, not saying it's not a security camera, but...there's little reason to think so, and those aren't 1975 clothes.Okay, there's no way I can prove this, but in 1974 I was in a bank in Denver and a guy came in (oddly enough wearing a hat and plaid pants) and he started shooting out the cameras.  They got a photo like this and what it said in the newspaper was that the cameras sent a feed to a film reel somewhere else so while the camera gets shot up the images are kept.  They caught the guy based on a clear image of his face as he looked up to shoot the camera.  /r/oldschoolcoolDoes anyone know where I can get a print of this?Can anyone resize this as a phone background?Man, had he waited a few more decades to rob a bank, he would have made off with a lot more moneyAh I see you were at the Met recently?So gangsta!","{'Sadness': 0.141235, 'Emotional_Range': 0.78, 'Tentative': 0.657, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.574424, 'Analytical': 0.249, 'Conscientiousness': 0.138, 'Agreeableness': 0.632, 'Joy': 0.036025, 'Disgust': 0.386003, 'Extraversion': 0.599, 'Openness': 0.354, 'Anger': 0.930104}","{'large': 0.450166, 'family': 0.28905, 'old': 0.354344, 'vintage': 0.401312}"

Make no attempt to solve it.As someone who's spent time in an anechoic chamber, it's a....*unique* experience. Your brain literally does not know how to process a room without echo. Echolocation is an understated but essential part of how we establish our location in any given space, and when we're deprived of this, the brain sorta...makes it up. It feels like you're underwater, or part of your head has been switched off. In total darkness I had auditory hallucinations. Trippy and unpleasant, but a very unique experience. One thing that's amazing about these rooms is how quiet they are inside.  I used to work in one with a guy that had a mechanical heart valve.  When we'd be inside it, the ticking of that valve seemed incredibly loud.Woman in labcoat: 'Can you hear me now?'What you see on the walls is designed to absorb reflections of electromagnetic waves. It's called an [Anechoic chamber.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber)NeatLooks like a Portal test chamber.I have spent time in an anechoic chamber, trippy as hell.  The tech inside played a song on two speakers on opposite wave timing (sinx and -sinx) and you couldn't hear the music playing if you stood directly in front of the the speakers. If you leaned to one side you'd only hear the music in one ear and vice versa. It definitely was one the the strangest experiences I've had. Interesting thing  about working in those.....you can hear your voice echo in most, but you can also hear your blood rushing through your body if it is quiet enough. Also, the chambers are VERY DRY and it's hard to work long hours in them. 

At Ft Monmouth ours caught on fire, and the fire conpany came, chopped a hole in the roof and dumped water into it. The directors face was priceless.

Can't they just be flat? Could someone explain?You sure this isn't Event Horizon?Ok here goes:
I've worked in the r/f chamber installation side of the field for many years. Some of the chambers are very simple, some are very intriguing and odd looking. The system as a whole is a smooth process, lots of handling material before you actually start building. Once you actually get down to it, the preparation side consists of buffing and wiping the panels edges and rails down with a scotch bright pad and rag doused with denatured alcohol. Basically: panels, clips/rails, and sometimes ibeams and the occasional unistrut. Once the ""shield"" is built, seismic anchors are securely placed and all the penetrations are placed, there is a mandatory shield test that takes place to ensure the process of building was a success, you pretty much want the chamber to be isolated in and isolated out, then what's the point of testing in a chamber like this if you could get your products test results with ambient interference and noise, these chambers are designed to isolate the products test range to optimize said test results. The shield test yields a certificate. Once the building and certification is done(this also depends on the customers frequency requirements), the next step is to start placing all the mounted parts and place those depending on specs and chamber type, then the absorber goes on next only if the chamber requires no ferrite tiles(iron ore, kind of like glass when it breaks), the absorber gets installed with industrial grade adhesive(most likely super 94). Most of the rest of the process is finish work, not much different from working on someone's house. Lots of respect for the space you're occupying right along engineers and scientists. Lots of face time and organization with all types of people. Maintenance is a huge part after the build is over, either an issue with the door or anything else inside the chamber itself, and again it depends completely on the type of chamber you're dealing with.
All in all, it's good honest and hard work, non-union, occasionally you'll get someone that is just a complete asshole, other times you'll get people that are easy to work with and all around awesome, obvious life lesson stuff, for what the chambers are actually worth installers get paid shit, it's a damn shame.

Took the time to talk to each person, took pictures with every person who wanted one, took the time to thank people for being there, asked their names, asked questions about who they are and what they do.  It made me so happy to see the image I had of him as a kid live up to the reality.  Around this time, he had just finished treatments for cancer, which someone asked about during the public Q+A.  He seemed so touched that people were aware of what he was going through, and thanked the audience from the bottom of his heart for supporting him then and through the years to the point of tearing up. When it was my turn to meet him, I gave the guy a hug and we took a picture flexing.  What is so beautiful, is that to this day, when I see an image of him or hear about him, I smile big.  The impression he left on me some 15 years ago still brings me happiness today. http://i.imgur.com/8YAx9bl.gifIt was a private funeral with every detail spelled out by Nancy Reagan before her death.

We had to add some special formula to the diet of the foals because nursing two is a lot to ask one mare. It was a lot of fun to assist feeding the little ones. 

The boys are fully grown, American Warmblood (Oldenberg/TB) beauties now.Oh god my pregnant self cannot handle this. Excuse me while I bawl. Imagine the first argument...
Foal: ""YOU'RE NOT MY REAL MOM!""
Mom Horse: ""Neigh! But I made you the horse you are today!""**Clarification for those confused: ...the mare's biological foal died during birth. And this baby's mom passed away during foaling. This orphan was introduced to this grieving mother and they bonded instantly.**This is the only way that it's nice to wake up with a horse's head in your bed.
You can see how sad they are, hopefully they can fill each others void by being together....both now in a ""stable"" conditionDamn feels.If you want a sheep (who lost a lamb) to adopt a new lamb, you take the skin off the dead one and put it on the living one like pajamas. It fits easily and the mother will often accept the new lamb because she recognizes the smell.The longer I look at the mare's eyes, the stronger the feeling for crying myself. 

I was trying to describe it to my daughter, but I got choked up and couldn't continue because I was on the verge of crying. Maybe my hormones are out of whack, I dunno...Was the mare still producing milk after two days (as in, had someone been hand-milking her to keep up production)? Was the foal able to drink some colostrum within twelve hours of birth? 

I don't doubt that these two have had very good care though--those looks like Thoroughbreds, that stall has a nice deep bed of straw, and neither horse has a halter on. [I pity the foal.](http://www.eastfallslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mr-T.png)Cows do this too. Then a year later you eat the little one.Legit question, can someone explain those whole ""crazy horse chick"" thing I've heard about? IDGI.

I remember these and the giant penises engraved everywhere in the road. Beautiful place.
 Just quick history lesson here as lots of comments are getting this wrong, these are called ruts built into the road for carts not chariots that were usually pulled by hand, also shown is stepping stones built as a pedestrian crossing so that they didn't need to step in the dirt of the street.Pompeii is a truly amazing place. As you walk around you get this feeling like this place was lived in. One day it was a bustling town, the next it was filled with volcanic ash. Centuries later here I am wandering the streets, poking my head in the shops and food stalls, touching the well where everyone would come to get water. It just felt so alive, and so so old.

I was also amazed at how organized it was. It was obviously a fully functioning society. It made me feel like life then would have been similar to life today. We could all be there, taking water from the well, drawing our cart to the market, buying lunch at the food stalls, praying at the temple, and then heading home.

I felt a connection to an ancient way of life that I could never feel in any museum.Pompeii is so cool.  And massive.  Spent a full day in Italy wandering around the place, it's more like a small city than a town.I was there a couple of years ago and it's truly incredible. Plus, I ran into [Dr. Dre and his entourage](http://imgur.com/7x0sFPQ)!Damn. I just try to imagine how bumpy that shit was at first. At least over time the ride probably became a bit smoother once you got your groove on. [deleted]Those stepping stones are really handy when there is a torrential downpour, the whole street turns into a river like when we were there  http://imgur.com/d36FxENThe interesting thing to me about this is that it implies that all or most chariots at the time were manufactured to very specific standards, all having an identical wheelbase. What was it? How and why did this standard come about? What made all the chariot-makers agree to use this standard? Did they have manufacturing unions or societies where they discussed standards and practices? Fascinating. I'd be pretty pissed off if I lived in pompeii and was paying road tax with roads in a mess like that. 1900 years later and they've still not even attempted to fix the bloody potholes?! Wtf?!Emperor's Old Grooves. How am I going to be an optimist about this?I wonder what the days of quality construction were like when you didn't have cheap options? Look at how well all those stones fit together. That shit's not asphalt, the way they designed roads allowed for drainage instead of just being swept down the sides. Sure asphalt is really nice when it's brand new, but it does not hold up to the test of time like these roads do.damn i went here a few years ago.. I could've had so much karma ):Looks like they were trying to build a light rail.The cart and Carriage was designed around having 2 horses pulling the platform, so was generally designed around the width of 2 horses. The roads that were laid down and paved were designed to hold these horse and carriage arranges, so the width of the roads was the width of 2 horses. 

That was the unofficial width of roads *and tunnels* for a very long time. However eventually we developed trains and there was a discussion of what the width of train tracks should be, it was eventually agreed the same length of a road so the trains could fit through the tunnel infrastructure of Europe and else where. 

So that became the global standard and fast forward another hundred years and the engineers and the scientists were trying to work out the dimensions of the space shuttle they would soon be sending men to space with, and they realized that that the rockets would be transferred on rail for some of the journey, thus the width of the rocket would be a limiting factor as you can only put so much on a train.

[So the vehicles we used to launch into space was limited by the width of a horses ass.](http://www.astrodigital.org/space/stshorse.html)As others have mentioned, those are cart tracks. 

For those who do not know, they have lasted because a volcano called Mount Vasectomy erupted the ashes preserved everything. There are theories as to why the ash was able to preserve everything but it is still unknown. So many dicks carved into those blocks.

Oh my god. EVERYTHING IS ON A COB. https://i.imgur.com/YmbzezQ.mp4Threaten me with a good time.What happens if you smoke the devil's lettuce?So, there's these two hobos, right? And they've been hitching and rail-riding across the Midwest, and end up in the middle of nowhere. 2 days in, they're starving. So they decide to go to the nearest farmhouse and ask for some food.


One of the hobos, Franky, is better with people, so they decide he'll be the one to go ask for food, while the other guy, Chuck, waits behind the fence.

Franky knocks on the door, and an old woman opens it.

""Hello,"" he says ""I'm traveling through this wonderful farmland with some friends, and we were hoping that you might find it in yourself to give us something to eat for our travels. I'm no good with farming, but handy enough with a broom or shovel.""

The old lady thinks for a moment and says ""Well I could offer you some food. Always have plenty around, but I've no need for cleaning or farmhands. All I really am is lonely. Be nice for a gentleman to spend the night seeing to this kind woman's wants.""

Now Franky's not exactly up for this, but he's hungry. So after a few minutes of trying to talk her out of it, he comes up with a plan. He tells the old woman to go wait for him in her bedroom and turn the lights out. Once she's inside, Frankie grabs some dry ears of corn and brings them with him.

So he and the old lady start in, and once it's dark enough, Franky takes an ear of corn and starts fucking her with it. Pretty soon, it's sticky enough that he doesn't want to hold on, so he chucks it out the bedroom window and grabs another one.

After what seems to Franky like hours of this, and he's sure the old lady's asleep, he leaves the farmhouse and walks to the fence to talk to Chuck.

""My friend, we're set! Sorry it took so long, but the owner of the house says she'll give us some food!""

""Well that's great,"" says Chuck, ""but I got too hungry to wait for you and went out behind the house to check the garbage and guess what?

She was viewed as a feminist icon as she regularly held her own in fights with men and also boasted a formidable intellect in areas like chemistry and other sciences.

But for all that the character is probably best remembered for her outfits including the leather catsuit she wore in her first series.
Designer Alun Hughes created the *Emmapeeler catsuit*, made a of stretch jersey or crimpelene.

***I took the picture in the fall of 1983, at sunset at the old docks in New Jersey with a view towards the World Trade towers in New York City. I had heard that there was a traditional Lovers Lane, a meeting place of young people in their cars, bringing booze and sometimes drugs. The sun was setting and the towers across the river were glowing before it became too dark to take more pictures.  Thomas Hoepker***In '74 I was born in Jersey and we went to the city fairly often. I remember looking at the WTC and thinking they looked so out of place, so futuristic. I always thought I would live at the top of the towers one day. Boy I was wrongNative NY'er here, what I remember for the late 80's is crack vials.... Crack vials EVERYWHERE....Man, the 80's. Nothing was off the table back then. Could sack out and catch Porky's on laserdisc all day and there was no one to tell you otherwise. Now I just sit here and eat toast with grape jelly and drink milk until I fall asleep.The twin towers look so out of place, it's weird...yet beautiful...damn NYC looks so short Those losers don't even have snapchat.  Besides the obvious 2 towers gone, what has changed about the area today?  I'd love to see a photo of that exact area now. I always look at pictures like these and wonder what happened to the people. Mostly I hope life was kind and they found happiness.

I can't seem to find any links to a full image though. 

Edit:
I stand corrected. Ford Falcon. The Chevy would have the quad headlights. Cool. Unless you're the guy that has to detail that bad boyRad... need more pictures.Thats pretty awesome :DDoes it affect the way they work much?

I visited Kenya and Tanzania once in 1989 when I was 8 and my dad was stationed overseas.  We took a tour to a tiny village on a reservation, and I took a bunch of Crayola markers and some paper because I was sketching and doodling a lot at the time.

As we were leaving, all the villagers approached the ""tour bus"" (it was really a beat-up school bus to move people around) trying to give or sell stuff they had made to the tourists.  Bracelets, necklaces, trinkets, just a bunch of colorful hand-made items.  I remember showing them the markers at one point, and started trading markers for items.

My parents were laughing at me bouncing from one side of the bus to the other, leaning out the window and giving away all my markers and pencils.  I ended up trading all the swag for an arm-full of bracelets and a bunch of necklaces.  They were cool people.

Marine biologist here (well, sort of. I also study terrestrial species but mostly work on whales and sea turtles these days). The ""legs"" are actually a unusual feature of belugas called ventrolateral abdominal fat pads, two long ridges of firm blubber that can be tensed and raised slightly by the abdominal muscles so that they stick out a little from the rest of the body. Belugas tense and raise them during rolls and when swimming upsidedown. Belugas have no dorsal fins and so it seems they are using these fat ridges as temporary stabilizer fins, deploying them only when needed. (It's thought that they may have lost the dorsal fins so that they could surface to breathe in tiny holes in pack ice without a dorsal fin getting in the way - this may also be the reason that they have an unusually flexible neck.) Their cousins the narwhals, another pack-ice whale with no dorsal fin, also have these fat pads, though the ridges are not as large and obvious as in belugas.

Yes.True anarchy is often represented as pure chaos, but anarchy is really just an attempt to recognize individual autonomy in it's purest sense. This means that any and all human endeavors are done on a purely voluntary basis. It's coming to the realization that, at some point, we have to start getting outside of this notion that we always have to have someone at the top telling everyone what to do and have that sort of decision-making power be absolute.

Anarchy is a scary proposition and it's totally understandable whey people would be scared of it. It would necessitate our society having a much deeper level of tolerance towards variety in life and it would also mean that everyone would have to assume, at a core level, personal responsibility.

There were studies done in the late 1960's and early 70's where some more free-form individuals, swept up in Buckminster Fuller concepts, took volunteers and had them live in various micro-communities that were governed in an anarchistic sense. These groups eschewed formal hierarchies and attempted to live according to the concept of everyone being exactly equal. All of these communities failed and broke up within a few years. What occurred in each was much the same. The groups usually self-divided in to three main categories of individuals, with a distinct, if not overt, hierarchy. 

Group A represented roughly 20% of the total population and derived of the individuals with extremely strong opinions about how the community would run itself. They were the loudest and most agenda-driven sub-population. After a short period of time, this group started calling the shots and leading the communities.

Another 20%, we'll call Group B, was made up of individuals who represented the passive and extremely uncoordinated members of the community. This group often became the subject of Group A's ridicule and disdain and took the brunt of whatever hostilities arose.

Group C can be seen as the majority of the population, as their 60% ratio was the largest by more then double of the other two subsections. This group represented those that just went along and tried to make the best of whatever was decided. They largely abstained from the decision-making and didn't initiate hostilities with weaker members (but also would not try to prevent provocation from Group A), and generally just fit in to whatever mold the community took on.

This study went a long way in describing how human's are designed. If not presented with a class system, humans will cultivate one on their own freely. 

This is my main concern with anarchy. I feel like I can make proper decisions on my own without guidance. I'm sure everyone, deep down, feels that way, as well. But the fact is, if you eliminate the systems we have in place and don't have a plan for something else to take it's place, the strongest people and the ones with the most obsessive ideas about how everyone needs to get along, will fill the vacuum. It's what happened in Egypt after the Arab Spring movement and many other examples.""If men were angels, no government would be necessary.""I am OK with a four year reset. Nothing gets worse/better, we just get four years, to examine the situation. I know it is not possible,  but I am a dreamer.
What we should do, with 100% certainty, is just force Louie CK to be president.

>Discovered in a forest near the Bosnian town Zavidovici, the ball has a radius of between four and five feet, and an ""extremely high"" iron content.

>Dr Osmanagic believes the sphere proves the existence of an advanced lost civilisation dating back more than 1,500 years ago.

>According to his fellow researcher Dr. Sam Osmanagich, the region used to have many more of the spheres well into the 20th century. Many were apparently destroyed in the 1970s due to rumours there was gold hidden in the middle of them.

>In 2016, critics are once again lining up to poke holes in Dr Osmanagic's rather grand claims. Discussing the Zavidovici spehere, Mandy Edwards of the University of Manchester's School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences told MailOnline the rock may not be man-made at all, and have been formed by the ""precipitation of natural mineral cement within the spaces between sediment grains"" - a process known as concretion.

He went on to name them ""Bosnian pyramids of the Sun and the Moon"" and scam a whole lot of people into supporting his pseudo-scientific ""discoveries"". Still, it's really great for tourism. You wouldn't believe how many people go look at poorly executed excavations, vague evidence and pumped up stories about pyramids in the middle of the Balkans that are supposedly older than the ones in Egypt!
Just an old crapper tank!Cool! Let's create a whole religion based on its discovery.Isn't this how ""The Tommyknockers"" started?

That is stunning. I'm amazed at the talent some people have in them. how many servings per loaf?The words you are looking for are new breadI would love to see a video showing one piece at a time in stop motion so I could see how the image transforms through the whole murrine.Holy kitsch, Batman!You can't even make a whole sandwich with one slice? So how do they cut it? I guess with a hot enough knife maybe, but that would distort the image. Though I guess you'd just polish it back.

I have to worry about buying one though. You see from the top that the image isn't completely consistent throughout the loaf. It's duck to get a slice with Mary not having a face on one side.$5000 a slice still sounds a little underpriced to me considering the level of complexity of this art...They should slice it thinner to make more moneyWhat if a new bread starts in the middle?looks better than all the modern art crap hipsters loveI should buy one, slice it even thiner, and sell both of them for instant profit!""Murrines"" those are the frogmen of 'Murica, right?Does anyone remember Fimo?

If you use 28-count cross-stitch material, and set the size of one stitch to be 3,300 km (the diameter of Pluto)...

Then Pluto and Mercury are one stitch...

Venus and Earth are 4 stitches across...

Mars is 2.

Jupiter is 43.

Saturn is 37.

Uranus is 16.

Neptune is 15.

If you just use the Radius of the Sun, it's 211 stitches (about 7.5 inches).

And the distance from the center of the Sun to Pluto is...  drum roll please...  5,363 feet (about 1.02 miles)

(Oh, and Earth is 135 feet from the center of the Sun.)Why aren't they to scale???

However, observers have noted the memorial's resemblance to a cemetery.

What the memorial is supposed to represent per the architect.[Some more pictures that, in my opinion, give a more accurate impression of what this monument and the area around it look like.](http://imgur.com/a/P7pgK)It's really impressive in person.

I say ""yah, whatsup?"", and she hands me a note written in english. 


Being the dumbass 15 yr old that I was, I assume she can't speak English and needs me to read this note to her... 


I start reading her the letter....



I'm thinking that this letter is news to her... so i am explaining to her, in my shitty german translation, the perdicament that she is apparently just hearing about. **it is tragic...** Her Parents died in an auto accident, her siblings are in foster care, etc... 

I'm starting to feel pretty weird about breaking this to her (especially since she isn't really reacting to any of the sad news in it).  


Then she sticks out her hand and asks for money. 


The note was was just meant to get me to give money....

Weird storyI wanna say this is cool but I dunno if I shouldI really like this memorial actually, even though it took me some time to get used to it. But what gets me is that all our remembrance days or memorials we got in Germany about the holocaust arent't really about remembering anymore, they are becoming rituals.

People just don't know anymore how the nazis started, how small it started, what their stances on refugees (Ostjuden) were, that they didn't start with calling for death chambers (this only came up in 1941, 8 years after they took over the country and 2 years in WW2). That it started with treating jews like we treat muslims today - not as working, living individuals who visit some building once a week and then go back to be like everyone else.This is so weird. I was last month in Berlin and I thought like it doesnt affect me at all but when you are walking through those concrete blocks it gave me goosebumps. You get yelled at for climbing/walking on them.

The Crab Nebula spans about 10 light-years. In the nebula's very center lies a pulsar: a neutron star as massive as the Sun but with only the size of a small town. The Crab Pulsar rotates about 30 times each second.

Seriously, tho - the LLP is a citizen-science project run by Cornell University which is trying to discover the reason why many of the native North American ladybugs have been becoming more scarce in the last few decades.

What they are doing is forming what we call a ""rub nest"". A rub nest is when 2 or more LBs come together and ""lick"" each others faces (fun fact LBs have tongues almost 1/3 the length of their bodies!) and mouths to share nutrients and more importantly, build each other's immune systems by sharing antibodies with one another. They will stay like this for hours at a time, licking each others faces until their immunity are bolstered and they can no longer become sick and die.

He said that they were amazed by the plethora of stuff you could buy in a grocery store. If you had been caught taking photos illegally, what kind of punishment would be typical?

I'd expect your camera would be confiscated or you'd be forced to delete the photos, but was there any threat of being detained or anything?Looking at your full photo series, these are some amazing candid photos of life in North Korea that I have never seen anywhere else.  The one thing that struck me was that any picture that wasn't in a city had food growing in it, and the hills were almost denuded of trees.In North Korea, there are places you can visit and places you cannot visit, and the latter are far more numerous. Well, this is one of them. Usually, we were accompanied by our guides, one in the front, one in the back. But at one point they were both in the front, which allowed for a literally 15-second long detour into this ordinary shop for North Koreans. That gave me maybe 10 seconds to take this picture, before being kicked out by the ""bad cop"" guide, and the atmosphere became rather unpleasant. I'm not sure if he saw me taking these pictures.

Also, I've got a photo album with the photos of my journey into North Korea, if anyone is interested.Nicely done!  Would love to see more of those ""staged"" North Korean areas to see the parity.My Chinese girlfriend has been to North Korea and had these pics to share.

This is an example of a stellar piece of original content that is both interesting and informative.  I also appreciate the fact that /u/M1ckey took time out to answer other people's questions about his trip.

Thanks for taking the time out to post this to Reddit.  With all that said, I have a couple questions for you.  :)

First, did you ever have any experiences where you felt somewhat anxious or unnerved (guards acting threatening, eyeing you up, etc.)

Second, were there any Americans with your group?  I'm curious if they would allow Americans at all (I know they did in the past, but obviously they can change that at any time).  

Thanks again.  Love your pictures.  This is actually worthy of a publication like National Geographic picking up on this or maybe a story in the NYT.  Very cool.Staggering, beautiful, eerie and quite sad. Do you want to be thrown in a gulag? Because this is how you get thrown in a gulag.

https://www.flickr.com/photos/caseyrbrown[deleted][deleted]^^^^Some ^^^^assembly ^^^^requiredHave to wonder if there is a bunch of these sitting in the corner of some Army base warehouse because of long forgotten clerical error. I had a teacher back in high school who was in the Vietnam war.  His job was to blow up bridges so the VC couldn't follow them or use the bridges to resupply.   Well, this meant he pretty much spent most of his time hanging around ""bases"" which were no more than commandeered villages.  One day, he takes bricks that were just sitting around and made a gigantic barbecue pit.  A villager had given him a pig for some reason or another, so he decided to throw a gigantic party for everyone stationed in that village, as well as any villagers that wanted to come.  Not surprisingly, he got into huge trouble, and was removed from the village and stationed in the worst, most degrading job there was.  They made him guard a junk yard in the middle of the jungle.  It was mostly jeeps exactly like this one.

Well, as you can see from the picture, these Jeeps mostly just bolt together. So 12 hours a day with nothing to do, his boredom got the best of him, so he started bolting these pieces together from various junked Jeeps to see if he could make a functioning Jeep.   He said he got about 90% there. The only thing he couldn't do with the parts he had was functioning brakes.  So he did the best he could, he bolted a gigantic pole to the side of the jeep that he could shove into the tire and pull as hard as he could to slow the jeep down.

He ended up driving the jeep around that little area for his remaining time in Vietnam, sometimes even driving around officers and other dignitaries, no one even questioned whether he was supposed to have a Jeep or why he had to use a gigantic pole to stop.The ultimate example of ""its worth more in the box"". http://imgur.com/a/5ZgEX

Army vet here, I was stationed in South Korea back in the early 80's. I worked at the base HQ but was all enlisted were required to pull motor pool duty one week a month. I reported ""as ordered"" to the Motor pool non-com and was assigned the duty of tearing down and repacking two Korean War era jeeps. They looked very much like the picture. They crates had a jeep size fold-out cloth with actual sized spots for each individual parts with pictographs of where to find the part on a jeep and how to remove them. The entire process could be done without reading any words. It took me ten days to complete the job. It was a most satisfying task.
Fragiiiillllle.Does it include an allen wrench or what?Are these the ""jeep kits"" that where offered for sale for $450.00 in the back of old magazines? First thing I thought ""Some assembly required"" I kinda wish that I could get a modern car shipped to me like this.  It would be fun to have to put it together before you use it.  Like the adult version of Legos!

**Edit:** I completely forgot about kit cars!  So I guess this still is a thing.They did this with larger vehicles too, I have a M35A2 and they were designed to ship in crates as well.  The tops disassemble with simple tools, windshield folds town and the highest point on the vehicle is the top of the steering wheel.I believe they were a lot more effective after they replaced the square wooden wheels with round rubber onesJ.ust

I was able to speak with Friedhelm Thomas on the phone this morning. It was hard to communicate because of the language barrier, however I wrote them an email in English with a link to the image, asking if he took the photo and if he did, where it was taken. If they respond, I will post it here.


EDIT 2:

The photographer replied to my email, confirming that the photographer is Friedhelm Thomas and that they would respond on the weekend, when they have some help with responding to my email in English.


EDIT 3:

Friedhelm Thomas told me the photo is from 1985 and the steel and glass structure was dilapidated at that time. He does not know what happened to it since then.
The exact location of the photo was over the hotel Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo near Lake Como in northern Italy. The location of the wintergarden is Griante/Cadenabbia. The park belongs to Villa Maria, a variant of the world-renowned garden of Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo.

EDIT 4:

It looks like the Villa Maria has undergone a restoration since 1985.
Here is a [photo](http://www.mondolariano.it/GrianteCadenabbia/serrav.jpg) of it after
 restoration- [photo] (http://www.arteliberty.it/immaginiliberty/como/serra.jpg)

Another angle: [photo] (Here is a photo taken from abovhttp://www.alephcomo.com/Gallerie.aspx?gid=1&fid=1e:)
Here is what Google has to say about Villa Maria: ""Villa Marie is surrounded by a splendid public park, in the centre of the village. It was built between 1889 and 1892 for the will of Martin Clerc and was completed by a heir of his, called Josephine May. The project was realized by the famous architect Giacomo Mantegazza.""I'm always curious what would cause a place like this to become abandoned.

To get a mixture of the iron nickle alloy and olivine this meteorite came from a small protoplanet from the dawn of our solar system that melted from the original [chondrite](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/space/meteorites-dust/meteorite-types/stony/) material and separated into  an iron alloy and silicate phases (core and mantle). Towards the end of the protoplanet's life it experienced a very violent collision with another body and forced the contact between the core and the mantle to become perturbed via shockwaves from the impact- hence the mixing. 

Impacts like this lead to bigger and bigger bodies and eventually the terrestrial planets... so this is kind of an baby picture of the Earth.

I live in San Francisco and I don't remember it being too contentious of a subject, but the Bay Area in general is dealing with the effects of extreme income inequality and gentrification right now. 

Plus some feelings might have changed after the clusterfuck that was super bowl city. Very true.  My highschool burned down in 1998.  It took us almost six months to even get textbooks.  We had to eat in circus tent half the next year.  There was even a proposal of taking all our money, building a brand new school on the rich side of town, and then give us the old school they were currently using in the middle of town.  They didn't even start building the new school a month before I graduated in 2000 because the idea of building a modern school on the poorer side of town was so controversial.  Granted it did only take a year to build from that point.  But I only had a school for two out of four years because of politics.Because the type of company hired to build a stadium consists of proactive doers. The type of company hired to fix a school consists of lowest bidders.Levi Stadium: Field of Jeans Because you're in it(school) three quarters of the year.

Edited for those that needed help.> Why does it take a year to build a stadium

Because it doesn't. Taking a quick trip [over to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium), here are the key dates:

* 2007: Santa Clara starts working on project to build a stadium
* 2008: negotiations begin
* June 2009: agreement is made between 49ers team and city of Santa Clara
* December 2009: owners of Great America file lawsuit, which is dismissed
* June 2010: voters approve plan (Measure J).
* 2011: 49ers begin pre-sales of seats, boxes
* December 2011: Santa Clara secures funding
* February 2012: 49ers secure funding
* April 2012: groundbreaking at construction site
* July 2014: stadium opens

If you include everything, it basically took 7 years. Even if you forget all the planning and financing, construction itself took over 2 years, and obviously there would have been a lot of design work before that (probably going back to shortly after the Measure J approval).Maybe your school is full of vandals./r/ToMotivateYouBecause it took longer than 1 year to build Levis stadium.


>The official groundbreaking took place on April 19, 2012.

>The stadium opened on July 17, 2014.

So the graffiti is a lie.


Not to mention school renovations and repairs are often scheduled around school days, so that education isn't interrupted by construction work. So generally there are major pushes to have everything in place for stages to begin and end over the summer months when students are out of school.Money is part of it - but also harder work. A hard-working owner/manager is chasing down the  contractors for any delays of his stadium - as a delay will lose him money. He will double check plans, call suppliers to make sure all is running smoothly etc. Your local bureaucrat is not putting in that extra effort for your school fixing/building./r/im14andthisisdeepGood question.

I'm in the STL area and everyone is talking about the Rams leaving and getting an MLS stadium built in the area and I'm still sitting here like, ""What the fuck?  Why are we even considering spending money on a stadium when we've got school districts who have been unaccredited for more than a decade?""

We are pumping out entire generations of children who ""graduate"" from high school with a 2nd grade reading level, absolutely no marketable skills, no hope for the future, living in bad areas filled with violent crime, and we are worried about a stadium?

It's only a matter of time until things get much, much worse around here.  We've already let things go for FAR too long, but when the AP students in a school only have teachers in 3 of their 7 classes in a day, what hope do any of them have at having a real life?

We have got a lot of work to do and meanwhile the deeply, **DEEPLY** racist people around here are all scrambling to find another major league team to come and let us pay for a stadium for them.

It's obscene how passionate some people are for sports in this city versus how utterly ignorant or apathetic they are about these important issues.  A few miles of freeway isn't going to protect us all forever and eventually, ignoring a huge swath of our population and basically relegating them to a life of poverty with the white flight epidemic in this area is going to come back to bite us HARD.

And in the meantime, people are suffering.

If she hadn't been so amazing, we would have gotten our gifts weeks late - if we had gotten them at all. 

I've always had such huge respect for the postal service. They always do an incredible job. Sadly most people will not give a fuck, or understand.  They will just be mad they cannot send shit 2 hours before xmas, and have it delivered xmas.  - Signed someone working in an xmas gift store.Plot twist: The postal worker didn't post that, now has to cancel his plans to get this shit doneTwist: Steve Harvey was asked to write the note for the mailman. It was meant to say Friday.Thanks Cliffy.TIL that *my* postie lied about being the world's greatest...Good to see Papyrus found work on the surface.How do you reward this?  When mail carriers do their job right, it feels like civilization at its finest.

I hope I'm not alone in wondering how to properly appreciate the people who enable our online shopping addiction.Plot twist.. This is fake and the last pick up was at 1. On the flip side, I ordered something on amazon on the 16th, and as of midnight est it has yet to even be packaged. I'm slightly annoyed, although I realize amazon employs humans, not machines that must bend to my every will :/someone made a prank, now he has to work till 5 to avoid embarrassment. lolI want to drop a letter addressed to;

I sure as hell hope that wall was designed to take the load and the rocks are supported to the lathe well.  Otherwise that thing is going to last 5-10 years tops.What exactly is used to hold the rocks in place...a certain kind of cement?In the boy scouts, they would warn us against using river rocks for our fire pit. I was told they can explode.This is by [Michael Eckerman](http://www.eckermanstudios.com/), [Here](https://www.pinterest.com/stacycats36/michael-eckerman-stone/) is some more of his stone work.The idea and execution are both really great, but the scale isn't good. It really overwhelms the house instead of fitting in and seeming like a part of it. Same thing but smaller would have been perfect.ITT: People who know about river rocks but not about fireplace/chimney construction. River rock is often used for fireplace surrounds and is easily found at many local landscape and decor specialty stores. The stones are not used directly in the fireplace where the heat is the highest. In addition, many stones are properly dried before being sold. 

They aren't wrong saying you shouldn't use river rock when making a camping fire. But, in this application, river rocks are completely fine and make for an aesthetically pleasing fireplace. It doesn't really matter what kind of stone it is as far as resisting heat.

Unless this was built some place that is completely wild west as far as building codes, this isn't a chimney and fireplace that is solely stone. There is a fireplace made out of fire brick and a specific heat resistant mortar. 

That feeds up into a smoke shelf which will be masonary and on top of that will be clay liners, wrapped in four inch block all the way up. There will also be four inch block providing the rectangular shape to lay the stone up to.

To sum it up: There is a clay liner that's an inch or more thick, a four inch block, at least an inch or two of space, then the four inch block exterior shell, another inch or two between the shell and the stone.

These stone are at least almost a foot away (with close to nine inches of heat resistant material in between) from any of that heat being produced in the fireplace and moving up and out through the chimney.and now there is a river with no rocks I admire the amount of technical skill and time put into this, but I think it looks really tacky. Nice idea, but the design make nauseous. I need order, sorry.Former mason laborer here - by far the funnest job I worked on was a huge entire house of irregular stone like this.  Basically it was a 2-month-long scavenger hunt, running from skid to skid looking for the right stone for the right spot.  Took longer and the rocks were harder to lift, but man it was a nice break from the monotony of brick-work.  And looked awesome when we were done!Nope. Sorry but it reminds me of the picture of the ticks in a dog's ear. I can't unsee that picture when I look at this chimney. I saw a picture once of a deer with hundreds of ticks in a group stuck to it and it looks like this fire placelooks amazing but how long do these actually last? the mortar will give way to weather and the rocks will fall out of place eventuallyi wonder what there is to stop rain from just falling right down and into your house.Looks like a hidden environmental puzzle from The Witness.These curves bother me. I like things that are square. I would be climbing that, in my childhood.Goddamn that's beautiful.

Little known fact, if you feed elephants lots of cheese that slows down their metabolism slightly and can, in very extreme cases, lead to dwarfism. The cheese can do this due to the way the enzymes in the cheese react with the elephants special type of stomach acid.

That's because tourism visas don't exist in Saudi Arabia, and what's more you need a permit to travel up to this region to see the tombs, and the Saudis are not really willing to grant them because these tombs are pre-Islam.

If anyone wants to see the rest of the pictures of this National Geographic story shot by Wayne Lawrence.I used to live in Flint, and these are the most well-dressed kids I've ever seen in this town. Private school? 
As a quick aside, I'm begging you all not to forget about Flint. This town has been getting screwed for decades, and people are finally paying attention. Keep pressing the issue, because the people responsible for this need to be held accountable. No slaps on the wrist this time. ""Back in 2016 I had to carry bottled water 5 miles uphill in the snow!""As shitty as the situation is little man looks sharp in the uniform.Fun story. I lived in Detroit for a summer in a house with no pipes and no electricity. It had been completely gutted. So no water, no working toilets, etc. It was pretty crazy but I grew up poor so it didn't feel as bad to me as it would for other people.

Background: my dad bought this house for hella cheap and moved out there. He knew what he was getting himself into and had plans to just rough it while he saved up to have the pipes re-installed, toilets and sinks and faucets replaced and get everything in working order. That never happened though. Life throws curve balls at us all the time. 

The summer of 2010, I went to stay with him since it was summer vacation from college. 

There was a lot of craftiness involved in living there. Being on my period was the worst. 

My brother (also lived there) and I would walk to the local library and brush our teeth there. We would stay from open until about 3 or 4pm and read and charge our phones. We were also able to use flushing toilets there. At home, we shat in plastic bags and then threw them away outside (tmi?) 

We were also able to get gallons of water at the store to bathe with. We would put water in little tin things (like for cooking bbq and stuff) and then use bar soap. We weren't the cleanest people but we weren't hella funky either.

My dad did splurge once when I was on my period and got me a room in a hotel so I could clean up properly. I was also able to wash my hair at the hotel which was nice. 

We didn't have electricity either. My dad and I slept on the floor in his room (brother was upstairs) and one day we went to RadioShack and bought a crank radio. We would listen to our favorite radio show at night. It was really nice. The sun set pretty late so we had a good amount of daylight to get stuff done. Whenever I would get home from the library, I would usually write or draw.

We ate a lot of fruit and bread and random snacks because we couldn't cook. My dad and brother also ate canned meats. 

It was a summer I'll never forget. It was actually one of my favorite summers in spite of everything. I knew that when I went back to school, I was going to miss Detroit. It's not the friendliest city in the world but for some reason the part I was in (the east side) felt kind of like the country to me. Things felt slower, homier, more neighbohood-y. It's hard to explain. But as much shit as people have to say about Detroit, it will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Most people don't know I've lived like this and wouldn't expect it. I'm kind of prim and proper at times and I'm about to get a master's degree. People with master's degrees don't shit in plastic bags!Gm refused to use it because it was corroding car parts...people expect flint residents to bathe in it?

Hhmm make it black and white and we are back to 1940 Maybe this is why we think old pictures looks so different. Because these are the photos that make it to the future. People in 2060 are going to think the same thing we're thinking now!Is this for showers, dish washing etc. as well?Stop commenting how much water that is for drinking. 

You get up in the morning and brush your teeth. That's a quarter bottle, per person, at least. You make your coffee. Two bottles. You drink it and wash your cup. That's at least a bottle of water to do that. Of course if you ate breakfast and your family ate too, you have to wash those, so bet on 10 bottles to do your dishes. You can take a shower, but the water is sort of blue today, which means the copper hasn't cleared the lines, and you broke out yesterday, so you just wipe up with a washrag. That's half a bottle. Per person. Minimum. If you need to wash your hair, that's an an additional 2-5 bottles, if you have long hair. 

You need to wipe down the counters, but you don't want to wipe lead onto them, so you use bottled water to clean up with, that's a bottle or 2. You water the dog, 2 bottles. THroughout all this, you've probably been sipping on a water bottle. 

You make spaghetti for dinner, that means 4 bottles for water for cooking, plus 10-12 bottles to wash out that many greasy pots and pans and rinse them, and you still have to wash everyone up for bed and get their teeth brushed, which is at least another three quarters of a bottle per person. 

Stop thinking of it as the drinking water allowance for the day. It's the only clean, safe, usable water in your home that can be used for anything but flushing your toilet, for the next 24 hours. Is that just *their* allowance or for the whole family? And wouldn't it be more efficient to distribute the water in gallon jugs?[Source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160209-flint-michigan-portraits-photography-lead/)please credit the god damn photographer.

Pardon my language and this isn't meant personally toward anyone but as someone from Flint, MI I say this:  Fuck off with using us as ""the state of America"" and all that.  Every 10 years we end up in the news for some ""look how the system has failed"" story and every time people act like they finally realize something needs to change.  None of you care in the bigger picture of it all.  A year or more down the road and you will have forgotten all about this and Flint will still be decayed and run down and left a shell of a city.  As shitty as this current situation is, it's been within a hair of this for DECADES.  This is just an interesting headline to the rest of the nation until it isn't any more.I apologize if this is not the appropriate place to post this, but I feel it may be useful since it's a highly visible post right now.

We are a band from Flint, MI (I currently live right downtown) called Sprowt.

Several bands, some from Flint and some outside of Flint, have contributed music to a $5 compilation album organized by Jonathan Diener (of The Swellers). 

100% of the proceeds are being donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Flint's Flint Child Health & Development Fund (flintkids.org).

If you're a music fan, please feel free to donate by buying the Not Safe To Drink: Music For Flint Water Crisis Relief compilation album at:

https://notsafetodrink.bandcamp.com/

The compilation album will be available on February 20th, 2016.

Thank you to everyone taking notice and doing something to help.

Put quite frankly, this whole thing sucks.Where can I donate?I can't imagine what I'd do if my kids had been permanently poisoned with lead. I'd go on a rampage.Flint is a disaster.  There's literally no quick fix and one that won't cost a huge amount of money.  Flint needs to be condemned and the residents should have their homes bought out at a fair market price before the crisis occurred.  100,000 residents + a quick google search showing that the average house price ~$100k = $10bn to buy out Flint. Probably a bit more than that, but in the ball park.  Shit, we spend way more to drop bombs on people in foreign lands every year.  I'm sure we can help 100,000 Americans out.

http://i.imgur.com/fkel2zN.jpgReminds me of the black cat I had growing up. Parents got her a few days after I was born. She looked just like this and lived to be 24 years old. She was an odd cat, but wonderful. Cats in general still amaze me because their domesticated form is just so close in behavior to the larger breeds that it is amazing. 

There is still a part of me that wants to believe I could have a giant cat as a pet. I know it's not true, it's cruel. I'd never partake in such a thing *but still* I want one, dammit. 

I don't know, after growing up around cats it is so hard to believe the big cats are hunted outside of the realm of self-preservation if you are attacked.

I lived in one for 7 years.  It was heaven, especially with babies/toddlers.  A warm floor for baby to hang out on is fabulous.  Many people chose to rip out the boiler required to run the system and install central heat.  Those people regretted it.  Radiant Floor Heating. Yes, they are very effective. They usually use a small boiler and run a type of liquid through the piping. Along with good use of insulation in the walls/floor/ceiling - these can save a lot of money in the long-run. And bare feet in winter are great!

Edit: A few people are saying this system pictured is electric. Perfectly possible, I know electric systems are also available. I work for a building supply company and we are just getting into the Radiant Heat in the past month or two.I went to Iceland in December, and was pleasantly surprised to find that many buildings are heated this way. They basically get free heated water from wells, and pump it through the floors. They were even in the process of getting this outside of the airport in Reykjavik.I never knew this looked that cool. I'd just throw some plexi glass over it and have some led strips and go all tron on it. The whole floor is lava and thus off limitsThat was my one regret when I had my bathroom redone, that I didn't get heated floor. I'm still kicking myself.The Weltzheimer/Johnson House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright had a system similar to this design.  That was back in 1948.  The problem occurred when the contractor ignored the grade of the material specified on the architectural drawing, and the system never worked properly.I lived in Korea for 5 years and every apartment I lived in had it. I really miss it.Rich friend had underfloor heating in his basment. A blanket on his concert floor felt better than my bedThese are great for bathroom floors! I've been looking for some kind of warming bath mat that doesn't require an outlet (because most bathroom outlets are high up so a wire would have to run all the way up and look unsightly) but apparently those are more of a thing in Japan than in the states...when i was in korea i had those boy it was so great . i wish we had them back in the states.Is this form of heating uncommon in the states? In Denmark where I live, nearly all houses (especially the ones built within the last 20 or so years) have them.Any idea whether these are more efficient?Well driller here, although it may cost a good chunk of change for the average home owner, vertical or horizontal geothermal loops can be drilled to various depths, essentially sharing Earth's energy with your home. I live in South Korea and this is the best thing ever. It's in every apartment. Just don't leave trash or laundry on the floor for too long. Wow I didnt know you can get that attention with somthing simple as a floor heating.
I live in switzerland and am a HVAC engenieer and this systems are standard since the 70es for residential buildings. Nowadays we plan them with water temperatures of around 30°-35°C, so the floor doesent really feel warm at all, but with really well insulated homes you dont need higher temperatures to heat the home which is really good if you use heatpumps because the efficency of the heatpumps are way better if you use low temperature systems like that.
The most efficient systems are TABS (thermo active building systems) where you build the pipes inside the concrete itself and use the concerete as a heat reserve, also good for cooling.
Sorry for my bad english, if someone wants more information just contact me :)

First dogs, then cats, guinea pigs, miniature horses, 500 pound pot bellied pigs, and now a god damned turkey. 

Next it will be lizards and snakes and the government is going to shut it all down and limit it to dogs and miniature horses like they did for service animals. 

These hipsters are just shitting in the punch bowl because anyone can pay a shrink to say a fucking turkey is an emotional support animal.

So when all of this comes to a head in a perfect storm where someone's therapy python eats a therapy turkey 30,000 feet above Colorado I'll get to say I told you so. Looks like Sweet Dee in ""The Gang Beats Boggs""Adam Carolla has a whole bit about taking Giligan, his attack pelican, onto a flight as therapy pet.  

Life isn't much wackier than comedy.IF you are so unstable that you can't fly on a plane without a live turkey, you should not fly. Imagine if that bird died mid flight? Buddy could do anything. avian flu - the originDelta airlines requires a mental health professional to provide written documentation that the passenger is being treated for a diagnosed mental health disability and the animal is a necessary part of treatment. Further, the animal is required to be trained to behave. I'm guessing this passenger didn't follow those rules, and the crew and gate agents didn't know enough to deny passage.

From the website:

**Acceptance Guidelines**

May or may not be trained to perform observable functions. However, the animal must be trained to behave properly in public settings as service animals do. Emotional support animals travel free of charge and the animal is exempt from cabin allotment. Like service animals, emotional support animals can be transported in the cabin.

Delta requires documentation *(not more than one year old) on letterhead from a licensed mental health professional to be presented to an agent upon check in stating:

* Title, address, license number and jurisdiction (state/country it was issued), phone number, and signature of mental health professional.
* The passenger has a mental health related disability recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 4th Edition.
* That the passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the passenger's destination.
* That the person listed in the letter is under the care of the assessing physician or mental health professional.

*Passengers may use a signed or stamped digital letter on their mobile device as long as the information can be verified (i.e. phone numbers, email addresses etc.)I'd be doing this the entire flight to the bird 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zvgcOrTtwMy hopes of one day having a service Cassawary have been reignited!The only reason anyone would ever need a goddamn dumb dinosaur like a turkey for a therapy animal is if they needed absolute reassurance they weren't quite the stupidest organism in the room. And even then, itd be close.If their plane crashes in the mountains at least they won't need to start eating each other right away like those soccer players did.I hate these assholes, it makes it so much harder for those of us with legitimate, trained, vetted and certified service dogs.

I tried so hard to be nice about it for so long but I just can't any more. The day someone's glorified pet, with no public access training attacked my service dog was the day the minor annoyance of it became a real issue I'm pushed passed my limits on. You want to take your unleashed, uneutered mastiff with a piece of shit paper you bought online everywhere for the attention? Fuck you. 

When that dog bit someone on the bus now we all have to pay for photo ID of us and our dog, thankfully I already have that since one of countries I regularly travel to(in the EU) requires it.

--
**Remember business owners:** 
Even certified service dogs, let alone bullshit ESAs,  have a set of public access behaviour guidelines, you CAN remove an animal who is NOT behaving within those guidelines. 

The dog taking the initiative of greeting strangers approaching the animal should be a clue the dog is not properly public accessed trained. The dog should automatically ignore others because it is WORKING, as in focused on it's handler and it's job.


This even includes the handler responsibilities, like keeping the animal from being any kind of nuisance- via position on the floor or noise or general disruptiveness; and keeping the animal groomed, clean and non-offensive to the general public. Dogs will always smell somewhat like dogs but the dog should not be excessively smelly, should not be drooling excessively, should not be shedding excessively as the animal should be brushed daily by the handler or helper. Nails should be tidily cut and not damaging floors. 
Harness/ID vests should be clean and properly fitted. (in the US service dogs do not have to have badges or harnesses, but this is pretty ridiculous, almost everyone with a certified service dog will have it wearing it's identification vest/badge and harness because it makes life easier for the handler!! If the badges on the dog says 'do not seperate from handler' there is a reason for this- please respect this, yes even in an emergency. For example my dog traveled with me in the ambulance after a serious car accident until we absolutely had to be separated so he could receive medical treatment. During something like an MRI/X ray he is in the operator's hut in the same room as the machine but protected. )
 


And remember: ESAs do NOT have federal access rights. They have some housing and transport rights but they DO NOT have access rights to stores, theatres or restaurants!

(Also the Service Dog Foundation is now training ESA cats with proper certification and are vetted behaviour-wise, if you need a non service dog but do need an ESA get a properly trained and bred one. Get a prescription, apply to an accrediated organisation, preferable ADI certified,  and get on the waiting list like those of use with seizues/are blind and low vision have to do. Stop with this special snowflake pretend service animal bullshit. I'm sorry to sound so mean but in the past three years the rise of this ESA crap has been a real burden on those of us with real service dogs. The animal just existing is not  a job. Training a proper, bomb proof service dog starts *before the puppy's eyes are even open!!*)More like ""anxiety animal"" for me. I would constantly be worried that thing we attack others or myself hahaI'd need therapy if that thing was looking at me for 2 hours.[Gobbels!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeOeIwKJ67g)I thought turkeys can't fly.What I want to know is how do they keep the turkey from shitting everywhere?!

/sorrynotsorryWindow seat is awesome. I can't even fall asleep on the plane ride because I'm too concentrated on staring out the window. Still fascinating no matter how many times I fly. 

The best ones are if the plane has a window exit. Fun fact, a lot of wide body aircraft say ""window exit"" but that seat actually has the window like 2-3 feet in front of the seat and maybe a foot behind it. So, tall people of reddit, make sure to ask if the exit seat actually has a window. Especially if you fly on a 777-300ER.

I am a geologist so I try to get a window seat to look at the familiar features on the ground in California, the San Andreas fault and the various ranges and structures one can see, especially when the sun angle is low. So I could see things like the Kettleman Anticline and the strike ridges of the Great Valley Sequence on the west side of San Jouquin Valley as we flew north. When we got about 20 min. out of Oakland the plane started to descend into the clouds and I thought that the show was over, but then I noticed a white colored bow that appeared opposite the sun in the clouds with a white spot in its center that I judged to be exactly opposite the sun which was low in the sky. As looked, and this lasted only a minute or so, I could see the shadow of the aircraft appear in the spot. Then we got deeper into the clouds and the effect was lost. I was seeing a glory and it may be reasonably common. I may have seen one years ago when I flew to Europe.

- Can you control the thickness of the layer to a great degree?

- Does the hardened resin let you ""scrap off"" paint that you've laid down?  Either fresh or after it's dried? I've worked a bit with oil but I'm not sure how acrylic behaves exactly or how dense and hard the resin is for scraping.

- Please try [this!](http://i.imgur.com/M40mAQ0.gif) These stereographic images are easy as pie to make.

http://imgur.com/I3A3CC0,rm8HPW4#0Now all we need is someone from reddit to draw Lisa utilizing all of the no's.I just finished studying animation and even on our final student films the directors of each project were encouraged to make sheets like this. Our teams were really tiny, only 5 or 6 people a project, but when you have multiple people animating on a film, all with their own distinct styles and artistic background, it's pretty easy for inconsistencies to happen unless you really peg things down! 

Even in a small team like ours, the style guide basically became like our bible during the project, I can't imagine what it'd be like in larger teams, if style guides weren't there! I love seeing ones from other series though, some of the do's and don't's are really interesting, things you wouldn't notice/think about otherwise It takes a little while to hammer out all these kinks and standardize the art style across the animation team. If you want to see an example of some of these errors in play, check out the first season of Family Guy, there are a few errors, but one that immediately comes to mind is the cutaway where Peter thinks Philadelphia with Tom Hanks is a comedy. When the POV switches from zoomed out to closeup, someone didnt scale the eyes correctly, so for a part of the scene Peter's eyes are huge As an animator, seeing everyone's reaction to something that is super common in the industry is cool. It's like ""oh ya, what I do is pretty cool""I played around with the image to see what was written on the back. Here are my results (someone more skilled would do better):

http://imgur.com/CgtqHamNaw look! He was smiling in the first photo, and now he has his mouth open.

I remember him being elected as if it were yesterday... 8 years.. Goddamn.I would bang. Being president ages a person. Look at before and after pics of any of them. Looks the same. George Ws hair actually got darker for a bit after he left office.You may notice the vein on the side on his temples has become much more pronounced. Along with the obvious graying of the hair.

It's was like a before and after infomercial where they have terrible lighting on the beforeEven this picture is giving a false impression, albeit the opposite one in so far as it tries to make him look older in the before picture. The picture of him when he was younger has him smiling widely which of course creates wrinkles and lines as the muscles of his face contract. This lessons the impact of any permanent lines on his older picture. 
  
TL;DR A better comparison would have the same facial expression in both and no wide smiles. TIL people ageHe was greying a bit in the first, and then 8 years later he is even more grey. Hmmmmm. How the hell?Wasn't your mole on the other side...?

Where in California is this again?Nice mosquito trench.It looks a bit like a rain garden. The function of a rain garden is to increase infiltration rates and prevent runoff. They can also act to filter out pollutants. It's hard to tell by this angle but it looks like the intent is not to just run water from the downspouts to the pavement. 

Overall I like it. It probably helps reduce runoff and increase water infiltration. We should all build these in our yards to improve the water quality of our streams and rivers. Could use more deep rooted plants in it to make it better. 

Also as a side note, the city I live in will reimburse half the costs of a rain garden up to a certain amount. I bet many other towns do the same and few people know it.

Edit: added name and location of the placeThe sea stack known as 'Dún Briste' was part of the mainland until 1393 when heavy seas severed it from the mainland and the people were taken from it by means of ship's ropes.

According to one legend, a pagan chieftain, named Crom Dubh, lived there. He refused to listen to St. Patrick who tried to convert him to Christianity. St. Patrick hit the ground with his crozier and the stack was separated from the mainland, leaving Crom Dubh to die there.

On July 31st 1980, Dr. Seamus Caulfield, his father Patrick Caulfield and Martin Downes, Professor of Biology at Maynooth College, landed by helicopter on Dún Briste and spent two hours there examining the remains of the building and plant life. They discovered that the building across the centre of the headland was a structure 30 ft by 13 ft inside built up against the south of a long continuous wall which runs through from the edge across the headland. The doorway in the centre of the south wall still stands over three feet high on one side. The remains of the west gable of the house had narrow divis - which may be a drainage channel - perhaps the building was a byre rather than a dwelling house. On the other hand it could have been a dwelling with the animals being kept at the west end of the building.

On the western side of the stack another building over 20 ft. long and at least 10ft wide partly survives but its west wall has now disappeared as that side of the building has eroded into the sea. In the building the door was in the North gable but of course there may have been a second doorway in the West wall which has now gone. Towards the mainland a long slab set upright may mark a grave. In a few places along the Western edge, remains of a wall survive and in this wall was the most fascinating feature of all. There was nothing more than a low opening about 2 ft. square. It is exactly like the sheep runs, which can be found in many places, which allow sheep to pass from one field to another but restricts cattle.

The size and shape of the buildings suggest that they were medieval. The area on top of the stack measures about 50 yards long and 15 yards across the centre. On the stack there was no trace of sea pink, a plant that is so common on the headland; instead the most common plant was a red fescue which, because it is ungrazed, grows very long each year and has built up into high tufts over 1 ft tall.You must mean 6000 years old.Reminds me a little of Azkaban I'm imagining a pterodactyl perching on it.

That's probably how he liked it.Sat the row in front of Lewis Black on the way to Vegas once. He was doing some talk show in LA and going home afterward I think. None of my friends recognized him or knew who he was so I assumed I was mistaken. Turns out they were fucking morons cuz I heard him talking as I exited the flight and it was definitely him. Well doesn't matter I don't need to harass him on a flight anyway.Just ran into Lewis Black in NYC over the holidays. Awesome guy in person.  Only mildly embarrassed myself when I started to wish him a merry Christmas.On one corner there was Lewis Black.

is the end of the universeI once saw Lewis Black, Dave Attell and Mitch Hedberg do a show all in 1 night. It was a Great NightShout out to Biloxi!Lewis Black came to my campus last year, and did his stand up routine. Was not as funny as I'd hoped; his opener was fucking hilarious. But Lewis was just meh. cant_trust_hillary strikes again>Are you shitting me!You mean Angry Al Franken?I know he's well respected and sells out large venues, but somehow it still seems like he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. He is and always will be in my personal top 5 comedians. I love Lewis Black. He's one of my favourite people in the universe. What a spirit.Saw him in a crosswalk, just he and I, and he stared me down like I was the one who was famous. It rattled me hard.In early 2000's I was living in Chicago. I was walking somewhere during the winter on Rush St and saw him pop out of a building with a trench coat on and lighting a cigar while hailing a taxi. I am not one to bother people so I just let him be but it was my only run in with a celebrity that I enjoyed. Meet him in SC after one of his sets. Incredibly nice man. Very quiet and well spoken.Saw Lewis Black in Kansas City last year. Waited in line about 30 minutes and asked him if I could get a picture with him. He obliged and I met my favorite comedian. Very friendly guy I hope to meet him again in the future. TBH you don't want to bother celebs everywhere they go, its really annoying, let them have their space too. They are flattering him very nicely, it gives him the opportunity to approach or watch momentarily and chuckle before getting back to his mall food. I'm right over here!!!  DAMN!  If you would...<stutters a bit>...just put down down those fucking phones for a second and look with the peripheral vision that kept our ancestors alive!

You know what?!  You know what?  You know what fucking amazes me?  You know what amazes me...<shakes finger>...is that these kids today will have be able to give better finger jobs than I ever could, as a kid.

""71 Years ago today I had just turned 9 years old, and was in the 4th grade.. The president had previously issued an ultimatum to the Japanese to get out of Burma and this was the deadline day. (China was our friend then) Hitler was raising all kinds of hell in Europe and England. (Germany was our enemy then)(Japan was our enemy then)
 
Joe Louis was heavy weight champ of the world, and as far as I knew always had been.
 
Roosevelt was President of the United States and as far as I know always had been.
 
Jesse Owens was still a national hero after the 36 olympics, and Jim Thorpe had not had his medals returned.
 
June of 1940 I was put on the USS Mariposa to go live with my dad in Honolulu. He worked for the government at Hickam Field and lived in Hickam housing.
 
On the day of Dec. 6 he worked from 4:00 till midnight as the Army Air force had decided to move all the instruments from one hanger to another. I rode my bicycle from the housing to the field about 8:00pm and took him his dinner.
 
The next morning I was playing out in the front yard, when all of a sudden these small airplanes with brilliant suns painted under their wings and on their tails flew over our house about 50 feet above ground.
They proceeded over the housing and I could hear the bombs and the guns when smoke erupted from the field. The planes would then turn right over Pearl Harbor and soon there was heavy black smoke everywhere.
 
I went to wake up my dad, and told him what I saw. He said it was just military maneuvers and not to bother him. ""About that time another zero passed over and he jumped out of bed.
He put me and my step mother into a 1939 Pontiac after gathering a few clothes and we were off to the mountains where he had friends. Our car was strafed by a lone
 plane and had about 6 holes in it, but we were not hurt.
 
After dropping us off in the mountains my dad returned to Hickam and we did not see or hear from him for 4 days. He related that the Hanger they had emptied the night before was totally destroyed, and the one they moved to was untouched.
 
I remember lying on the floor in front of a big radio with a big green eye in it telling us what had happened and that the government was fearful that there might be an invasion.
In June of 1942 I was placed on the USS Lurline and returned to the US to live with my mom where I lived happily ever after. (Through both democrat and Republican Presidents)""

When I asked my grandfather more about it, he said:

""A few days after returning to Hickam housing, I rode my bike to the main gate of Hickam field. The guards were armed with sub machine guns. A 1934 ford with 4 Japanese men approached the gate and were told to halt. They accelerated instead and the guards opened fire killing all 4, the car swerved out of control and rolled over. I can still see that in my mind""

I asked if my grandfather would have ever come back to the mainland if that hadn't happened. He said:

""Not sure. Even tho my dad had remarried, my mom was trying to get to Hawaii , but the only way was by boat which was hard to do on $4.00 a week""

[Edit: a comma really changes the meaning.]  
[Edit II: yo halt = to halt]  
[Edit III: Thank you for the gold! I'm overwhelmed with the support and love from the community over this. You rock!]
[Edit IV: I'm holding a toast to both of you who gilded me! Cheers for all!]Thank god for spellcheck otherwise he would have went down in history as the guy who couldn't spell drell[Same message from CINCPAC](http://40.media.tumblr.com/9fd925c53329ea9cfd45844caa296446/tumblr_ng6n2amUfw1qz6f9yo1_1280.jpg), changing the ""not"" to ""no"" makes it that much more terse.Not really the most appropriate time to add a little kiss ""x"".Back in 1941, the US used DD MMM YYYY? Or does US military always use this format even today?The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor hoping to knock the US out of the Pacific. Yet they failed to destroy the main objective as the Carriers and then missed two other major areas the fuel depot and the submarine base on the other side of the island.My grandfather was a ten-year-old first-generation Japanese American kid living in a plantation village in Maui on December 7th, 1941. He told me that he had gotten up early that morning to play marbles with his friends when he saw the planes flying overhead. In the years that followed, he and all of his brothers joined the US military to fight on behalf of the nation of their birth.Man they really managed to milk this for the movie.

He is still alive but doesn't like to reminisce to much about this. He was on the captains skiff tied to the dock on ford island waiting for their captain to return from a meeting when they started dropping bombs. Him and the few guys with him immediately took off and started picking up guys out of the water who had jumped off their ships. They would take a load to shore and then go out for more all while the bombs were dropping around them. After the attack was over he was ordered to man one of the buoys at the entrance  to the harbor. He was literally dropped off on the buoy to sit there and act as a lookout. They forgot about him in the craziness and he ended up sitting on that buoy all night long before being picked up in the morning. He has some heartbreaking stories of having to collect bodies in the aftermath. Completely crazy to imagine having lived through. He was/is a brave man who put his life on the line when it mattered most. I really look up to him. Probably too late for this but what the heck.

My wife's grandfather turned 19 on December 7, 1941.  He had graduated high school six months earlier and was working in the Bethlehem Steel Mill (Aka ""The Steel""). The guys at work had thrown him a party over dinner and they were joking around when someone came into the lunch room and told them all the news. They went from ""party"" to livid in a moment in time. 

""Pop"" was so pissed at the ""Japs"" (he called them that until he died) that he got up the next morning and enlisted. But he didn't just want to fight in SOME theatre, he wanted to (he said to the recruiter) ""kill every last Jap"". Pop was an amateur radio enthusiast, and was a hunter. And he worked in a steel mill, so he was no wimp. The Navy put him on a boat and sent him to the Pacific fleet. 

By 1945, he was fighting as one of MacArthur's men to liberate the Philippines. One building in Manila, the Manila Hotel, was special to MacArthur: he owned the Penthouse Suite. The Japanese military had taken the hotel as a barracks and command center, and MacArthur had enough. He ordered an artillery attack on the building. Pop, being a radio operator, went with a group of machine gunners to cover the building and call in artillery ranging. Basically, he would tell the gunners to shell left, right, forward, back, etc. 

Before the shelling began, the machine gunners took up positions covering the exits of the building. When the first shells started hitting the building, Japanese soldiers would try to flee the building. But as soon as they came into view of a door or window, they were riddled with machine gun fire. Shells would fall, Japanese men would try to get out, U.S. Soldiers would cut them down at the door. This went on for hours. Eventually, the piles of soldiers who had been shot were blocking the doors and windows. More shelling and more shelling happened and eventually Japanese men were jumping from windows, and being shot to pieces as they fell. 

Eventually the U.S. force stopped shelling and Pop and his fellow soldiers were told to go in and finish off the Japanese troops who were still hiding out (it was very common for the Japanese soldiers to dig in and fight to the last man). 

Years later, a decade after Pop recounted this story to me and my wife, he died. When we were helping my mother in law go through his things, we found a box marked ""Manila"". Inside were Japanese patches cut from their uniforms, pins and insignias, and ammunition casings with Japanese writing on them (all of this went to Pop's nephew who knew how to get the effects back to Japanese officials). 

Edit: Manila with one LI met the late Pearl Harbor veteran and survivor, Richard Fiske.....who lost many buddies December 7th.  He said for decades after the war, he had a tremendous hatred for the Japanese.  But, he said he finally had to let go of that hatred because it was eating him up inside.  He later befriended an old Japanese man who was one of the surviving Japanese Zero pilots who attacked Pearl Harbor and they would reuinite on Oahu on December 7th.I don't understand the priority and classification system on this. Are they supposed to cross off the relevant one and just didn't? It can't be all of the ones mentioned. 

Maybe they were just too busy at the time to bother with it and the message implies that it would be a priority message, but you'd think they would at least throw a confidental at it, if not secret.Just imagine if it actually was a drellI knew a guy who was on a ship that day.  If he is telling the story truly, he may have been one of the first people to see what was going to happen.

He said they were at sea, and he was looking West.  He saw planes approaching, and as they flew over he saw they were Japanese planes.  He ran to the deck and alerted the officers, who approved him to radio it in.  

Here's a transcript of an interview he gave:  http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.85495/transcript?ID=sr0001great story /u/psycholepzy

Heres my Grandpa's story:
December 7, 1941 my Grandfather was 17 years old and had just got a job on base at Pearl Harbor as a civilian. Not sure what he did just that he was an apprentice working on the oil tanks that refueledd the ships

He lived in Aiea, at the time a small neighborhood near Pearl Harbor. He woke up to the sounds of explosions. He said a friend came over to his house with his car and they drove up to Aiea heights to get a better view of the harbor.

By the time they got up to the top he recalls seeing the USS Arizona exploding. After awhile of watching there was a message that went out on the radio that said for all workers of pearl harbor to report to duty/work. He asked his friend with the car to take him to the harbor.  His friend was terrified and refused, instead his friend dropped him off back home and my grandfather walked the few miles to Pearl Harbor.  By this time the attack had already completed but my grandfather had no way of knowing that and was terrified.  

He never really told me of what happened once he got to the harbor, or what he did the rest of the day, except he remembers seeing a a pile of dead bodies piled up in the back of one of those big army trucks. 

He later was drafted into the Army in 1943 and served with the 25th infantry, fighting in the Philippines in 1944.

My grandfather is 91 years old and has dementia but still remembers that day.A date which will live in infamyThis awesome story of a Japanese kamikaze pilot who survived his crash and washed up on the most isolated Hawaiian island, and tried to hide what had really happened from the residents there, who were cut off from communication (since the attacks destroyed the radios at the Naval base).

Mine are always dirty or cloudy.And folks are constantly saying how it's Australia that's deadly.What's interesting about this is that Australia is the biggest coal supplier to China.

Australia isn't alone in the ""exporting problems"" world of course. Lots of resource rich countries export to countries with lower environmental or safety regulations. Recently Canada was trying to restart it's asbestos industry to export to countries with no asbestos handling regulations, a classic ""not my problem"" approach to making money.

Stephen King's: THE MIST 2 
I honestly would not visit these parts of China or take a job there for fear of breathing that air. [This](http://i.imgur.com/H4XCRPh.jpg) is what I had landing in Beijing. This was in December of 2013 so I'm not sure what it is like two years later, but that was one of the better shots I had of the smog.

For other shots, this was [November 4th](http://i.imgur.com/VNlrE7k.jpg) compared to [two days later.](http://i.imgur.com/W8fKNpi.jpg) And a [particularly bad December day.](http://i.imgur.com/IEmxRum.jpg). These last shots are in Tianjin which is an hour train ride south of Beijing.Air is to China as Waste Management is to India.wow, you picked a good day to land in china! you can see through the smog!Left looks like isle delphino, right looks like dystopia[deleted]And here everyone is worried about Canada's emissions. Hope you stocked up on Rad-X.China is Mordor.Makes me wonder how much more maintenance is needed to keep the planes flying (particularly on engines) in China compared to significantly cleaner air elsewhere.Usually when I encounter a post that relates to anything about China, it's a shitstorm of misinformed opinions, mostly anti-China but also pro, but not as much this time. Good on you reddit.Eeew.YuckSo it appears life in China hadn't become colour yet.

EBAYI had the Super Soaker 200.  Left it in my closet for a bit while I was at university.  She sold it for a dollar while I was away.

I'm not bitter...I had that EXACT one.  Thanks for the reminder that I am old.My brother and I each got Super Soakers for Christmas one year. We were *very* excited to use them, of course... but given that it was the middle of winter and the ground around our house was covered in snow, it seemed like we'd have to wait a little bit. 

Not wanting us to be disappointed, my father suggested that we fill the guns with hot water from the kitchen faucet. ""Just be careful,"" he told us, ""to keep from shooting each other in the eyes.""

""I'm a really good shot!"" my brother replied, eagerly hefting his weapon.

My father smiled mischievously. ""Oh, I'm sure... but maybe you should practice first."" He cocked his head to one side, apparently considering something. ""You know, I bet there are some icicles hanging off the house. Those would make good targets!""

Not long after that, my brother and I found ourselves outside, trying to suppress shivers as we fired at transparent stalactites wherever we found them. We made up an improvised game in which every accurate shot would count as a single point, and every successfully eliminated icicle would count for two. It eventually occurred to me that our game *almost* seemed like we were doing a chore of some kind... but since it involved guns and Christmas presents, I figured I had to be mistaken.

Besides, I had a better score than my brother.

**TL;DR: Super Soakers start seasonal scutwork.**Just think how different your life could've been if you actually got that for Xmas. Possibly made new friends through a water fight that you didn't take part in. Through that friend you started hanging with a different social circle. Through that social circle you met a beautiful girl that you ended up in a relationship with. She was an adventurous type, and you moved across country or possibly emigrated...

All because they forgot where that super soaker was.That reminds me: I was snooping in my parents' closet one year looking for presents and there was one  on the floor with my name on it, wrapped. It was a small thing, jewelry. I carefully opened it and closed it again, leaving it on the floor, because if I put it back on the shelf I'd be caught.

I didn't get it for Christmas. I never got it. It stayed right there on the floor, in the same spot, mixed in with the shoes, the rest of the year. Until I finally asked what it was and they yelled at me for knowing damn well what it was because I had obviously dropped it on the floor when I was snooping. That my friend is quite the find. I remember getting the one with the plastic backpack with the double tubes. Your parents should be ashamed for keeping that from you.100 was the best! I had the 200 and it held so much water it would break under it's own weight.The 100 was far and away the best ss ever madeI never understood the need for that extra bulb of water. I was an SS50 man. Sometimes I would dual wield.You sure showed them!Someone was a bad boy 20 years ago.So...

What did you do to not deserve it in the end?Well la de da! Look at the rich kid that got the 100 everybody! All I ever had was a 50.You would have shot your eye out.What ever happened to GOOD super soakers? I bought my little brother one a few years ago and it looked AMAZING, but it was garbage. It didnt get any distance at all.What'd they even say about it? I have bad memory, but to forget I stashed a present in the attic for 20 years is even beyond me. I feel like I'd get reminded somehow randomly. Like at a dinner 3 years later and be like ""shit Barb, we left that super soaker in the attic!"".I had a 200, which was a lot like this model except with double tanks, for twice the water (and twice the weight unfortunately). You could cause some serious soaking with one of these. 

One year I was on vacation at Hilton Head with my family. Just hanging out on the balcony of the condo, and there were a couple of boys about my age on a lower level, screaming and causing all kinds of ruckus. I yelled down at them to shut the fuck up, and of course they responded with a string of expletives and various taunts.

I was 11, and they looked to be a bit younger. Young enough that I would have felt bad for just beating them up. Luckily, I had my trusty Super Soaker 200. I topped it off and headed downstairs. The boys were on the level just above the parking lot, and as I approached I could hear them still taunting me, assuming I had merely gone back inside my room.

With my gun fully pumped, I crept silently towards them. The condo was built on pylons above the parking lot, so I had ample cover as I approached. They couldn't see me at all until the last minute, when I stepped out, raised my gun and unloaded on their position. The look of shock on their faces was priceless. They scrambled to get back inside, but it was too late. Both kids got blasted, and I even got to spray a bit inside the condo for good measure before they could close the sliding door. It was fucking beautiful. Didn't hear shit from those bastards for the rest of the week.Back when squirt guns were worth a shit.I remember the first time I put gasoline in my super soaker with a lot piece of wood at the end. 

I ended up setting our yard on fire, so our lawn was pitch black for a summer. Mom was angry, brother and dad thought it was fucking hilarious. I thought it was the best fun with a super soaker ever. Pro Tip: your standard waterhose fitting will screw right into the bottle connection. My brother and I found this out and were able to set up a mounted gun position at the water hoses.YES!
I too had one of these beauties! Actually I was the only one with a super soaker 100 on my block. Everyone else had Super soaker30's and 50's, water balloons or basic water guns. Everyone except Justin. He had the one that had the tank on the back. He was the shit when we were 12. He had all the best toys back then. RC cars, Video games ect. He always had the best stuff. Water guns were no different. 

I remember we were in the middle of one of our summer water fights. About 20 or so kids all having a blast. Justin was soaking everyone like always. During one of our many battles, while replenishing my ammo (water) I noticed something. The end of the water hose had threads and they looked very similar to the air tank on the back of my super soaker. Being the curious 12 year old I was, I decided to see if it would screw in, in place of the tank. It did!

So I screwed the hose in and turned the water on. AND BOOM! I had a friggen cannon! Did not need to pump it. Just pull the trigger and the thing UNLEASHED! Justin was taken down a notch that day. And I still remember that day, almost 25 years later.They were a beast of a home base cannon if you screwed it to a garden where the round ball was (we had a rule; no hoses, and that was our work around.  Two ss 50's and a grenades were better on the move than that was anyday.You rich kids and your SuperSoaker 100s.

OK, maybe not just these.

My wife is a serious WTP fan, but didn't know the originals still existed. We went to NY for our 25th anniversary and I managed to persuade her there was something she really needed to see at the New York Public Library Children's section. It gained me huge amounts of Brownie points.

I disagree about the setting, what better place than a Children's library?

Apparently the real Christopher Robin resented his father using his name in Winnie the pooThat donkey does look incredibly depressed.Owl and Rabbit were based on real animals they saw in the forest, so it would be a little more morbid to have them stuffed and on display.http://i.imgur.com/YGEbRDI.gifvWhere did you find this? This is awesome. I didn't even know.there was a real Christopher RobinRoo has seen some shit. I'm confuzzled, where are any of the heffuleumps or woozles?Ever seen the Russian version?

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bEwE4wyz00o[This](http://img.allw.mn/content/pf/ok/tphcj4a4.jpg) is the bridge that the real-life Christopher Robin would play pooh-sticks on. It's in the UK [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Pooh+Corner/@51.1003291,0.1084524,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x15e02718a9bf3acc?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiordvu8KbJAhUG0hoKHQ_GBZgQ_BIIigEwDg) and is free to visit. I visited it about a month ago. There is a [whole route](http://www.theaa.com/images/travel/maps/walks/Sussex_Walks_Map21.gif) you can walk visiting a number of sites from the books including a memorial for author A.A.Milne. I was a bit torn by it all for a number of reasons.

Firstly it's prettyhard to find. There is a [lovely cottage](http://www.pooh-country.co.uk/) on Pooh Corner right in the middle of the local tiny town where you can stop to get tea. It's beautiful. The walls are decorated by stunning hand-drawn pictures done by Milne. Some just hanging in the toilet as if they aren't worth a lot of money.

But the route itself is poorly signposted and the bridge is surprisingly under-cared for. People have scratched their names into it. A [little 'house'](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/4/5/1302026640537/Winnie-the-Poohs-House-As-007.jpg) made into a tree nearby had been vandalized since that picture was taken (where someone has ripped the door off with a crowbar). A plaque commemorating the bridge shown in the first picture has also been pryed off also and stolen away. It was heart breaking to see the bridge was pretty badly cared for.

It made me think how this bridge and path should be a tourist attraction with people visiting from all around the world. But then I became torn because the lovely forest and local tiny village surrounding this bridge would likely be destroyed by the influx of visitors. A.A.Milne would hate to have seen that happen.

So it tore me a bit. The bridge deserves to be cared for and kept to a condition worthy of it's history, but at the same time cannot be over-exploited by commercial tourism for risk of damaging the surrounding area. I'm not sure of the fair trade-of that can be met.

What I would say is that if any master craftsmen here on Reddit fancies making a new plaque for the bridge to recognise it's importance, I would happily drive down there again and attach it up.[And this is why he's called ""Winnie the Pooh""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVhxrgMcZm8&list=PL1848FF9428CA9A4A&index=39)Yes! These were at the New York Library when I visited last year as part of a children's books exhibit. It was a great setup and I took lots of photos, some of which I've uploaded here http://imgur.com/a/DjvB2That's kinda sad... especially in that bleak setting.Damn, I don't know what my deal is.  I'm a 29 year old dude, and everytime I see anything with Winnie the Pooh, I get really emotional.  Watching the theme to the movie or the TV show, or whatever, I just can't help it.

Winnie the Pooh always has this crazy ability to get me to cry, even when it's not trying to be emotional.  [Seriously, this shit right here makes me cry every time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiVXYs6VLWw)

I refuse to watch the 2011 movie because I'm sure I'll bawl like a baby through most of it.  Even playing the Pooh stages on Kingdom Hearts can get me sometimes.Winnie was probably the biggest let down in that picture.   Not even as plump as you would think, nevermind the color.LOVE this!I can see why Eeyore was depressed all the time.Muh tigga.I'll give you ten bucks for the lot.Pooh was actually based on a real bear at the London Zoo, named Winnie.  A lady just released a book about it, since her grandfather gave the bear to them.

Really interesting storyhttp://i.imgur.com/YObHCCu.jpgPiglet's seen better days...You think that's crazy, you should ask him to show you his 100 acre wood.Eyore is proof that depression can be there from the beginning.

I'd always apologize and try to get a smile from them by comparing the footprint to the bottom of my own shoes to prove that it wasn't mine.When this happens and you saw the package, you don't sign for it. You tell the delivery guy I do not accept this package. They will return it to sender. Of course you will need to contact the sender yourself afterwards and explain. Once they recieve the dammaged package, they will clearly understand.Looks like my UPS guy was delivering for FedEx for some reason.I work for FedEx Express. Seeing this really irks me because the end line deliverer will ultimately take the blame no matter what. If I were you, I would contact your local FedEx Express and see how they intend to handle this. More than likely they'll try to take care of this because I doubt that our guys did this (We actually fire people on the spot that mishandle packages). Remember, that just because FedEx Express handles and delivers it doesn't mean that the local person near the Dell warehouse or other shipper doesn't touch it as well. FedEx has contracts to move packages with USPS, UPS, and other large and small competitors. Good luck and sorry that it was delivered to you like that.I'm not surprised. I work at a FedEx facility.

If the public saw the shit I saw on a daily basis, nobody would use them anymore.Was it in one piece?I worked in a FedEx warehouse before and this doesn't surprise me. The packages often got treated like shit because the working conditions were abysmal and people would get pissed off. Also, there were times I was told to kick a package in order to get the work done faster. Granted I don't how it is in any of their other warehouses but I've seen this many times. They rebooted it for you.All the major carriers do this.Not going to make something Dell made any worse... I used to work in shipping and receiving. Chances are that box was laying flat on the ground and was stepped on before anything was ever in it. Shipping & Stepping service, only at FedEx. could be from the box factory. i work at a box factory and i step on boxes and shit all the time and leave black footprints from the ink.Fuck yo mobo, mofo!I used to manage a fedex terminal. You guys wouldn't believe how your packages were handled. I fought my ass off everyday to try and stop this shit. People who have to wake up that early and work that hard just don't give a fuck.

The book is about the cultural history of barns and farms in Norway, and contains a lot of information about the different styles of barns found all around the country. It's a really interesting book if you're at all into agricultural history, and there's really great pictures like this all over it.

This particular barn is from a farm in Valldal, an area in the county of Møre og Romsdal in Western Norway.Just a regular second floor ramp in the World of Warcraft.It's called a [bank barn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_barn). They're really common here in Ontario, though typically it is just a straight ramp or an actual hill that it is built into. 

Traditionally the upper level would be the hay loft, so you use the ramp to get the hay up there via truck/tractor. People still use the upper level for hay, but some people are starting to move away from that and keeping their hay in a separate building as it can spontaneously combust and start fires. 1.  Search for ""Norway"" on reddit.

2. Select high scoring picture of your choosing. 

3. Post again with general title + ""norway""

4. Reap karma.That definitely would have been better than my family's strategy for getting hay into the loft, which consisted of backing the truck up to the barn and then tossing every bale up by hand.  That's one thing I absolutely don't miss about farm life... no more hay days for me.Why do horses and cows need wheelchair access?Looks like the house from that game [Brothers.](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Brothers-A-Tale-of-Two-Sons.jpg)I see a lot of WoW comments, but all I see is Zelda.[removed]""With the most 4G LTE coverage...""Reddit loves Norway Looks right out of an RPG like Fable.Straight out of fable!

I see an employed person with earbuds hooked presumably to a device that plays music. That means this person has disposable income. While it might seem gross to say, people need to and _want_ to work. It's super easy for us to sit in our first world lives and shit all over people working in conditions that our climate-controlled sensibilities find outrageous, but I think that's mostly because people haven't seen inside a factory for a good, long time.

I'm not saying conditions can't be constantly improved, but in every single interview I've seen of employees for companies from Foxcon to lumber mills, people are happy to have jobs so they can afford the lifestyle they want. These people support families, they have friends and can have a social life with them. They have the money it takes to participate in society. Are they rich? No, but as a whole China's working population is doing better every year. And that's a whole hell of a lot more than I can say for the average American worker whose wages stopped competing with the cost of living about three decades ago.

EDIT: *the paved paths!!** phew, finally out ran that damn goose! I have a huge Great Dane and I was walking him one time through a Walmart parking lot.  I had to cross a road and a few cars stopped to let me cross with my dog.

I hurried across and gave a quick courtesy wave and was instantly attacked by 2 geese, they were sitting in a bush somewhat like this picture, they hissed at me and slapped me with their wings for a bit.

My dog was terrified and tried to run while leashed,  which luckily pulled me away from the geese. When I looked back to the road those cars were still stopped and everyone was laughing at me.

 it was pretty funny. I assure you that goose is just fine. The tape is to protect the shoppers. Geese are psychotic.

Why do you think Canadians are so nice? Because our geese took all the anger.I may wander over to Costco and take a gander. I work at that specific Costco pictured, in North Carolina. This inevitably happens every single year. Tomorrow's news will feature the headline, ""Goose dies after shoppers pass it around for selfies.""At my college one of these birds has recently been hanging around. It's really chill and it's gotten used to people so it will actually approach you and just sort of follow you around, you can even pet it. Most students here love it and there's even a facebook page dedicated to the goose.[deleted]Just so you know, there is a migratory nesting law in the US that protects nesting birds from being disturbed. Sure Costco could have tried to shoo the bird away at night or something but if they had been found out they would have received a large fine.

But good for them for obeying the law. Not all businesses do.The golf course I play has a german sheppard they use to chase the geese away. Those birds are some vicious fuckers if you get near them.

I wonder how the employee that put up the caution tape is doing in the hospital? 24 hours later the parking lot is covered in shit and there are 30 people with goose bite marks.

The city even puts no-leash easements in place over winters so dogs can chase them the fuck away.

And this is what happens when you think you're holding a moth but really, it's a wasp. http://imgur.com/Ik5bA9fThis appropriation of wasp culture makes me sick!Last spring, my 4 year old daughter came running downstairs, terrified of the bee in her room. I went up to take care of it and was confronted with this hairy, hornet monstrosity. Emergency procedures were initiated and within 5 minutes I returned to her room armored in full snow gear and adorning a variety of club and racquet-like weapons. Fortunately, I was able to dispatch the monster swiftly while sustaining no injuries of my own. Proud of my accomplishments as a protector, I posted a picture of my trophy to social media, where I was informed that hornet moths are completely harmless. 

My daughter still believes me to be a hero and I plan on keeping it that way. Sorry moth, I'd still swat the shit out of you.Another incarnation of MothraELI how to fuck can this happen in nature? I understand looking similar but not looking like a copy. How does something evolve into this?? That thing must go through a life of identity crisisThis is a Hornet Moth. A harmless moth which... ouch! Okay, turns out that was actually a hornet. Damn.I hate killing things but with wasps and hornets I have no compunction. Does it buzz? Buzzing initiates my killing instinct but I would feel bad knowing I killed an innocent moth that got some awesome adapting skills.http://i.imgur.com/eOK8Sow.jpgOw! Ow! Fuck!

Okay, I guess this one's just a hornet. I remember an episode of *Maya The Bee* about these fuckers. 

Hornets were the bullies of the insect world, so when one showed up everyone treated him like a king so they wouldn't kill them - being fed grapes, fanned with palm fronds,  the whole setup, then come to find out he didn't even have a stinger and the whole thing was a con. 

I think they forgave him,  but my 6 year old self hungered for justice. This is a repost.

Here's the tweet.Byron hit the nail on the head when he wrote his Epitaph to a Dog:

Near this Spot are deposited the Remains of one who possessed Beauty without Vanity, Strength without Insolence, Courage without Ferocity, and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.


This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery if inscribed over human Ashes, is but a just tribute to the Memory of Boatswain, a Dog who was born in Newfoundland May 1803 and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808


When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,

Unknown to Glory, but upheld by Birth,

The sculptors art exhausts the pomp of woe,

And storied urns record who rests below.

When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen,

Not what he was, but what he should have been.

But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,

The first to welcome, foremost to defend,

Whose honest heart is still his Masters own,

Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,

Unhonoured falls, unnoticed all his worth,

Denied in heaven the Soul he held on earth 

While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,

And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.

Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,

Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power 

Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,

Degraded mass of animated dust!

Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,

Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!

By nature vile, ennobled but by name,

Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.

Ye, who behold perchance this simple urn,

Pass on  it honours none you wish to mourn.

To mark a friends remains these stones arise;

I never knew but one -- and here he lies.RIP Diesel, his life was worth more than all of the scum inside that apartment[deleted]I wish dogs could live forever. so sad to hear. Rip buddy.

The flight plan comic was the one from Calvin and hobbies when Calvin goes to the wrong lady in the super market.Man, he really Fouled Up. What really sucks is that some poor enlisted guy had to clean up the aircraft because of the pilot's screw up.My grandfather was in the Navy, and was on the USS Wasp (carrier where this picture was taken) in the early 50's.  He didn't get to partake in the prank, but did get to see the aftermath.  Some higher-ups in the Army were not pleased, but there wasn't much they could say because they were clearly in the wrong. Granddad's superiors found it amusing, but couldn't do much more than smirk and lightly scold the people responsible.  Anyways my granddad was able to get a [picture](http://imgur.com/jrHZyVS.jpg) from a different angle.  Thought you guys might be interested.TIL: Ubangi can be used as an insult.

In the Persian Gulf in 2002, our 'birdies' (helicopter crews) would tag any helo's that landed on our deck for whatever reason. Most helo crews did the same, tagging either the deck, or the aircraft. At that point, he should just eject.Lmao the Air Force still got trashed back then*Do any of you assholes have the money to reimburse the United State Navy for that aircraft?!* My grandfather served on the Coral Sea in the Korean war.

I can honestly say it was the most fun I can remember having in at least ten years. The culture was like nothing I'd ever seen at festival before, no fights, no people being shitty, just people having fun and being cool (and also consuming an inordinate amount of drugs).

Coming from a total skeptic, I cannot recommend EDC highly enough. It's one of those things you need to do at least once in your lifetime. I guarantee you'll have a good time.

That being said, be prepared to bay $9 for a 12 ounce can of either Bud Light, Tecate, or Shock Top.[Heading into day 3](http://i.imgur.com/PzdwNNI.gifv)Thats insane. There are like 5 ferris wheels!Holy fuck that is a lot of people. I almost just thought that was the ground.Man how much MDMA does it take to power a place like that?EDC is amazing but the most important thing you can do is wear earplugs. Get musician types so the quality isn't hammered. Seriously, everyone's tolerance levels and genetics are different to noise exposure and the noise level IS damaging your ears at EDC. Hundreds will come out with tinnitus and hearing problems. All it takes is one exposure without plugs and you're fucked for the rest of your life.

Don't fuck around and safeguard your hearing.

Edit - Since this has got up-voted a lot, I want to point out earplugs, good ones, won't make the music sound shitty. There's stuff for any budget. From $199 to $20 ety music plugs. Anything is better than nothing, and fitting them PROPERLY is important. You will not get the full protection if they're not fitted properly so make sure you're lifting your ear up and out a bit (use the opposite hand for each ear) then slide it in slowly for a deep secure fit.

Also, be warned that even a 20db reduction might not even be enough for some places. Some places are well over 115db. That means in less than 30 seconds you're going to have damage without plugs. That's louder than a giant 747 taking off and you're standing right near by. I've had friends come out with temporary threshold shifts, one which didn't go away fully even after steroid injection to save his hearing. What's that you ask? Imagine that everything you normally hear clear and nicely became extremely muffled...and it can be permanent. Don't fuck around if it's too loud. Step back, switch your musicians for foam (which give you around 30db reduction) and take breaks.

Just because you go to 10 concerts or venues, have some ringing and it goes away overnight or in a few days, doesn't mean it will do that the next time. That's your ears already in trauma and one time, sometimes just your FIRST exposure, will be the last time and yours won't recover. Tinnitus isn't the only thing you can get. Hyperacusis (sensitivity to sounds) and loads of other issues can occur from the damage.

Be safe guys/gals.The amount of energy required here must be incredible Looks like fun but I cant imagine comfortably rolling and tripping in such a crowded space. Give me a few acres of woods with neon ferris wheels. Thats my jam.I'm going to this years EDCLV and will be taking my mom with me. This is going to be her first rave ever and I'm so freaking excited for this experience! Man EDC and all it's attendees are awesome!! I remember in 2012 when the 2nd day was [shut down due to high wind](https://vimeo.com/70294612), yet everybody kept their spirits and energy super high. People were drumming on trash cans and dancing to it. There wasn't any music for a few hours but people still had the best attitude! Anyone have a 4K picture of this?Never been to EDC but I'm a big fan of Electric Forest, it's not as big but still great Been going to EDC for a few years, still fun but so damn crowded now.I WAS THERE! FLUME WAS AWESOME!I had the pleasure of going to the first EDC in Las Vegas and while it wasn't as crazy as the one in this photo, I can safely say those three days were easily some of the best of my life.I CAN'T WAIT!! This year is the TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY!! Awh fuck I completely forgot about this stuff... This time of year is such a damn nightmare for hotel security in Vegas... We literally get about 30 overdose reports, like 10 rape reports, a shit load of property damage, and so many damn fights or people doing incredibly dumb stuff in the hotel. :/I worked EDC last year. The amount of work that goes into this event is absolutely insane. Definitely a once in a life time experience. I probably will attend one more soon though. Before the event and even during the event in Vegas, everyone you pass by always chants ""EDC, EDC, EDC"". It's childish yet pretty cool at the same time.

When a Monocled Cobra opens it's hood in self defense (like it is in the picture) it is flattening it's body. The combination of this, lighting, background & albinism is what makes it translucent. There are also potentially other genes at play because I know there is Trans genes in other snake species.  Normal baby Monocled's are not translucent.That snake's got a wicked pump.

It's literally not possible to be parked there longer than that during those hours.
[deleted][Meanwhile in the UK...](http://images4.moneysavingexpert.com/images/permitsign.jpg)What do the green blocks (ones without P) represent?That sign is great is you're walking down the street and have the time to leisurely stop and interpret it. 

But really shitty if you're driving by and need to understand it quickly, from one lane over, without holding up traffic.

Unfortunately, most people who need to park aren't walking on the sidewalk.It annoys me more than it should that the 2 hours between 7am and 9am is twice as big as the 2 hours between 4pm and 6pm.

I guess the 8am had to be there because someone would argue that it wasn't clear on Saturday what half way between 7am and 9am was, but it still annoys me.That's brilliant.  I was about to ask ""Where is this"", but looked at the image again and felt silly.
 
It's in LA, says so on the sign.

Apparently they will be installed on Spring and Main Streets between 2nd and 9th Streets in Downtown Los Angeles.  It's a pilot program, lasts six months.  More installed if people like them.

Here's a [screenshot of the page](http://i.imgur.com/RfL1mtK.png), since I have no idea if reddit will hug it.

Also here's a picture of [Mattel Football 2](http://i.imgur.com/pk8wRln.png) because it's my post and I can do that.  I'd rather an electronic one that just tells me if I can park there or not, and how long before it changes.This was done by an amateur designer who just printed out a sign and posted it on her street: http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/01/designing-less-confusing-parking-sign/8190/ and now is getting picked up by actual city governments

Check out http://toparkornottopark.com/

But then the city will lose revenue! I was walking in Philly yesterday and a couple had parked their car on the street during the two hour time period parking was not allowed (in tiny and confusing language, of course). 

I walked by and saw how confused they looked, and directed them a few blocks away to parking that was free and legal (but a 2 hour limit) because otherwise they would have been towed. In that section of the city, the garages are roughly $40 for 90 minutes! 

I live in the suburbs, and people always ask why I take the train into the city instead of driving... PPA are running a legal racket with those indecipherable signs. Than how would you close budget gaps in places like NYC if people were to understand the signs? P should be $what's the point of having 2 hour parking from 6-8pm if you're allowed to park after 8? Nice but it will take too long to interpret while driving past in a car.

Edit: poor spelling, even worse grammarWhoever coined ""If you're cold, they're cold"" never met a husky.Interesting that your dog specifically bred to live in a snowy environment would make this choice.Meanwhile at your neighbors house...

http://imgur.com/alKzSwl.gifBred for the snow. This dog would be fine in the Arctic. Should I subscribe them to Husky Facts?

Welcome to Husky Facts! Did you know that Huskies can work and live in temperatures as low as 75 degrees below zero? Neat!My parents live next to a pair of huskies that have never slept inside since they were roughly a year old. They live in central Alberta, where it gets as cold as -45C. 

In fact, if you bring the dogs inside in the winter, they start to overheat after about 30 minutes. 

When I stay over, I will take them out for walks, when you open the gate and see them curled up on the deck, covered in 6"" of snow, they wake up shake the snow off and come bounding down the stairs. Couldn't be happier.When my mother came to stay with me after she lost her home she brought our family German Shepard with her (he was 9 at the time). This dog LOVED being outside, all the time. Didnt matter the temperature. He loved the cold, loved laying in the snow would roll in it, and play like a puppy.

Well I had a big caged area installed professionally for him so that he would have a big area to run in, which I also had a chain on him when he was outside (only because he was such a big dog and the people next door had little kids I wanted to make sure they weren't afraid even though my sheperd loved kids). 

We had a rule that if the temperature hit 40 or below we brought him in, didnt matter how much he wanted to be outside. He had shade, was given water 3 times a day (fresh water) and was fed like a king. He was use to the country so when he moved to the city he would bark a lot. It took use a few weeks but soon he wouldnt bark as much but everytime he heard loud noises and things like that he would (big trucks, fire trucks, police cars, etc since I live in the city).

Well one day I get a knock at my front door and its this woman who lives a few houses down. She tells me to bring the dog in the house because its cruel to have him outside. (I check the temperature as she is talking to me and its 43 degress out). I explain to her that he is a German Shepard and that he loves being outside. She tells me its animal abuse and that if I dont bring the dog in, she is calling the police and animal control. I laugh in her face, tell her to by all means do it but when they show up and prove her wrong that I will make sure to press charges against her for false accusations (I dislike animal abuse, treat animals better than I treat myself).

So fast forward two days later I get a knock at the door, its the local Animal Control officer. She was very nice and asked me about the dog. I take her back there and the first words out of her mouth are ""Why did this woman call me? This dog is beautiful and happy!"". I show her the paper work (I keep my animals up to date on shots, visits, etc) as well as his license that is required by city law. My dog is rolling around demanding belly rubs and being a goofy beast as usual. She apologizes and tells me that the person that called said I was leaving my dog outside, treating him like crap, not giving him water, etc etc. I point out where the woman who calls lived and she goes over. Then a huge argument breaks out between them with the animal control officer telling her that she isnt allowed to do this, and that the dog is fine blah blah.

Fast forward a week and a cop is on my door step.....I open the door and hes asking about the dog and the altercation the woman had with animal control. I take him back to the dog and he shakes in his head. He asks where she lives and slowly walked off.....

They never bothered me again, and the cops and animal control apologized to me. I flip that woman off every single time I see her. >Siberian Huskies can work and live in temperatures as low as 75 degrees below zero Fahrenheit .

Your neighbors are morons. Huskies have warm hearts. But the rest of them are made of ice. They are one with the snow. Yeah, the whole ""If you're cold, they're cold"" campaign has its heart in the right place, but it's definitely only applicable to most breeds, not all.

Huskies, Pyrenees, and Bernese Mountain Dogs will sit in the snow for hours and not even blink.

I housesit for one family that has a massive, gorgeous Bernese Mountain Dog.  They have a permanently unlocked doggie door, so the dog is totally capable of choosing whether or not he wants to be in or out.  Even on cold winter nights, he'll go out there when I go to bed and sleep in the backyard.

It's just comfortable for him.Animals' ancestors lived outside, all the time...Ha ha, I remember your dog from last winter. Amazing last year's picture didn't convince your dense neighbors. That one he really went out of his way to find the snow. Maybe the presence of the dog bed in this one will get it through their thick skulls. If not maybe send along some Jack London stories.My cousin made the mistake of building a swimming pool and buying a Newfie at the same time.  The dog wouldnt let them use the pool.  Newfies are water rescue dogs.  It would pull them out every time they went in.  God forbid the dog was locked in the house when someone is in the water.  I've got two huskies. The younger female won't even touch snow if she can avoid it. The male utterly refuses to come inside when it's snowing. Granted I'm in the mountains in Australia so we don't get blizzard level storms but at the slightest sign of snow he starts to kick up a stink so he can go outside to play.Do your neighbors know that sled dogs sleep outside in antarctica?I had two huskies and they had a way into our house from their pen in our backyard. After a night of snow, I'd look out back and see the snow drifts had buried that pen in at least a foot of snow. I knock on the window and you'd see my two huskies raise their head out of the snow. And then go back to sleep because fuck you, that's why.And my Doberman wants under the blanket if it's below 75So this is really stupid but my boyfriend and I have been having a heated debate about whether your dog is in an igloo or not. He's just sitting on top of snow that slopes gradually upwards, right?I called to complain about a neighbor who left their husky outside all day... in the 90 deg heat of August in Cincinnati with no water available to the poor thing.  

I dont understand how its not common sense that they were bred for the cold and cant take the heat.  Sorry your neighbors are idiots OP. Back when I was a kid, I built an external dog house for one of my first hunting dogs, according to a pamphlet that I got from a vet.  I put in straw, made the opening a certain size/ratio, and made a little porch so she could always be off the ground.  The base of the house had insulation as well.  I crawled in side to test it one cold evening, and got hot as hell in there.  With a winter coat, dogs do just fine outside, and need cooler air to regulate their heat.I have a Newfie and she loves the snow. She scratches when she wants back in, but she'll be out there for hours. My one idiot neighbour, who owns a Bichon, said it was abusive that I don't put a dog coat on her in the winter........my dog IS the coat.

In all seriousness, those are awesome!These are great!  
Should definitely display them in /r/CrossStitch as well! :)Will you cross stitch a belt made out of asteroids? I can't wait to see Uranus!

Edit: My first gold, from a comment about Uranus. Who'd have thought.. Thanks!Since they're not to scale but are made uniform size in order to enjoy the details of each one, I'm curious - are you going to make Saturn have a extra-large canvas to accommodate the rings, so that the planet itself will match the size of the others? If you took a little more artistic license and did the rings horizontally rather than at their tilt, it looks like it could reasonably fit on a canvas the same height as the others, but exactly twice the width, which might make grouping tidy when you display them... I love this. I used to cross stitch with my grandmother. I am a male and I got tons of shit for it, but I had a natural ability to do it well for some reason and liked doing it. I was fairly young so the people who gave me shit for it eventually won and I stopped doing it but love seeing stuff like this as it reminds me of my grandmother. These are awesome!!! I only recently got into stitching and absolutely love space and all things in it. Did you make the patterns yourself or purchase them somewhere? I would love to give it a shot! If a stitch in time saves nine what does a stitch in space do?

BTW, Well done OP.Do....Do the death star...I was about to come in here like ""No you didn't..."" because I've seen these elsewhere. It was your etsy page lol You should sell those... To me. Awesome!

Impressive!This kind of stuff blows my mind. 1800 years ago a blacksmith was probably churning these out for the legionaries, not making a bidets about it and was completely unaware that his handiwork would not only survive the battle, but survive all the time in between. 

Amazing. I'm guessing they must have had some Roman document containing specifications of army helmets. Must have had to be standardized right? Plus, I wonder how they ensured steady supply of helmet being manufactured. Did the Roman government have ""public sector"" blacksmiths? or did the orders get contracted out?

It looks like it would've taken many weeks to make just one of those helmets. Must have been really expensive.I'd love to know the backstory of where this was found, and how it stayed in such great shapeYou know what amazes me? At some point in time this was just a helmet. Some quarter master probably shuffled it through his inventory without a second thought, some soldier probably casually cast it aside when he got home from drills or whatever, maybe he even thought it was a piece of crap because it didn't fit just right. What was simply a protective hunk of metal to them is a priceless artifact to us. It makes me wonder what objects we handle casually every day that people will look at with wonder and amazement a thousand years from now.PULLO! Formation! Someone actually wore that. Someone wore that, with all sorts of emotions going through his head. Excitement, fear, friendship, love, hate, anger, lust, rage.

And it could be the one you're using right now without your ever knowing. Just like that helmet was (presumably) worn by some legionaire who's buddies had no clue that thousands of years later the dude's helmet would be enshrined.

- How's this size? Good! 890 points

- How's the pose? Hmm. It's so so. 340 points

- How's the technique? It's alright.  620 points.

Eaglie is in the middle of the frame! I'll double your points for you!  1850 pointsNice photo.  Lots of chroma noise though.  Should be easy to get rid of.Hate to break it to you OP, but you'll probably be disqualified. You see, that's not actually an eagle. If you look closely, you'll see this is actually a fish in an eagle suit. Easy mistake to make.Is it just me or did you do something to the edges in post processing?Gorgeous photo. 

[This] (http://i.imgur.com/i7mbJnr.jpg) was my entry. You've got a great starting point. Sharp picture of the bird in flight with lunch. Pose is very strong, even if the angle isn't as good for showing the fish as it is for showing the power of the wings. Head is very crisp. You weren't blessed by great light, but the even light has enabled you to capture all the detail you need to work with. 

The processing is letting you down a bit, with the mild but visible large halo, and with the color noise that has been brought out. By reducing that noise and perhaps with selective contrast work to make the whites pop just a bit more, the shot could show at its best. 

Good luck in your contest. Professor Oak would be proud. Centered and the pose is great.Birds of prey are so fucking sweethttp://i.imgur.com/OfWhLMm.pngThis is a great photo man! If I could make a quick professional suggestion. Im a Digitech and retoucher and you were a touch heavy handed on the localized contrast adjustment (sometimes referred to as clairity). That tool is fantastic for bringing out details and enhancing the richness of the blacks but youre starting to get a halo around your subject which is kind of a game killer, which would be a shame for such a beautiful photo.

Edit: This technique is also known as/done as a high pass layer on softlight.You should post this to /r/Murica and make a patriotic title for extra Karma.Nice eagle shot [Hello darkness, my old friend](https://youtu.be/PorLYbXDVJw)Wait wait - you rented it? Holy hell what have I been missing - who rented it to you? Is this a service type thing that does all kinds of lenses??!Was this at Conowingo?What kind of eagle are you?It looks like you noise reduced and sharpened the eagle itself, while masking out the background.  Maybe a cheaper body that pushed the ISO a little too far?  Maybe a little too much recovery of RAW data to get that fish to appear?

Yep, that's an Eagle.  1st prize.  When I was a kid, my dad ran a fishing charter in Ketchikan, Alaska. He had this trick for getting great eagle photos for his clients. It turns out bait fish float when you pump them full of air, so if an eagle was circling nearby he would toss a herring balloon overboard and tell everyone to get their cameras ready. I cannot remember an instance of him doing this where the bird didn't immediately spot the bait and dive down for a quick snack. 

The tricky part of all of this is to time your photo for when the eagle's talons are outstretched and skimming the water's surface. My parents have two or three such photos framed in their living room. Bad focus.

A favorite stand-up from George Carlin: 

""The planet will be here for a long, long, LONG time after were gone, and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself, cause thats what it does. Its a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed. And if its true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesnt share our prejudice toward plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted plastic for itself. Didnt know how to make it. Needed us. Could be the answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question, 'Why are we here?' Plastic asshole.Anyone else reminded of CoD 4 ""all ghillied up"" campaign mission?

It wasn't a giant house.  Normal 3 bedroom.  Older.  Just, it had originally been built on a lot of land and at some point the previous homeowner had built a 6 car garage.  Functional, but not fancy.  Maybe a car collector or something.

The house was nice, but there was the question of what the hell a 1 car family does with a spare 6 car garage.   Then we got the idea ""wait, we could put a bowling lane in there!""  This turned into a multi day escapade, searching craiglist nationwide trying to figure out how much getting the equipment used would cost, pricing out labor... eventually we were looking at pool tables, arcade games, pinball machines and dance machines... bar equipment.  We had floorplans, mockups, etc.  It was going to be so awesome.

We ended up buying a different house closer to work.  It was the right decision at the time.  Commuting sucks.

*Luuuuuuuuuuuucky.*I agree waffle house is truly amazing.If you start getting chased by dinosaurs I guess you could say you were in the wrong place, at the wrong time. I think this might be my friends' vehicles.  He has both a DeLorean and that JP jeep.

His DeLorean has a Corvette engine in it.How many gas station sightings did you have to choose from tho?No matter where they go, neither needs roads.I have seen both these vehicles in Universal Studios, coincidence perhaps.....And here I was looking forward to a photo of a really awesome gas station.  Nope!  Just some cars.Probably going to or from the Dezer Collection in Miami, dudes private collection. I used to do dispatch for him to transport vehicles to shows and shit. Hardest move was the original 007 car, helicopter, and fucking submarine to and from Chicago. My boss would always meet the owner, Dmitri, on one of the top floors of the Trump towers in Hollywood for payment, I so wish he needed me to make that run at least once. Interesting job, sometimes the drivers would collect payment in our office and stop by with the cars, like the old ass batmobile, and that DeLorean there.

Edit: I'm sorry, is anecdotal reminiscence not allowed?Being towed by Optimus Prime, with a Batmobile escort.

Was this in Arizona?! 
There is a guy who has both of these cars plus the hummer from Zombieland These are being transported to a comic book convention or toy show I'm sure. These cars tour the con circuit. It's nbd. Oh my god, is that the trailer the Duke boys used to jump the General over that dry creed bed?
/r/spotted would liked this :-)I was working in a furniture store in Burbank. It was super hot out. Like Africa hot. Anyway, Newman comes in. Newman, whatever his name is, from Seinfeld, who was also in Jurassic Park. 

Anyway, we had a rule that we couldn't bother celebrities, so I didn't talk to him, I just hovered near him in that really annoying furniture-salesman way. 

I was pretty close to him and caught this perfect view of him, sweat all over his face, as he looked closely at a price tag which was hanging under a bright spot light. It was just like the movie when he was in the rain and the headlight was shining on him. 

That's it. End of the story. Please tell me why you cropped Optimus Prime out of the picture.

No Billy is not a bully because he cut in line.  Billy is just an asshole. 

I'm not a bully because I asked you for your homework and you didn't have it. That's my job (and maybe an asshole).

Every slight, every dirty look, an unflushed toilet... all bullying. 

A girl went and reported her entire table she sits at because she had her arm in a sling and one girl asked what happened and they all stopped to listen to her answer and she felt like that was bullying because she didn't want them to ask about it or know what happened. Like bawling, counselors office, filled out these I've been bullied pages for each kid at the table... I can't even make this up. What is it if someone does something unintentional hurtful over and over?TIL I bully the printer at work.I know some mods from some other subs that could benefit from this!Except that's not rude. Rude is doing something you know to be wrong or disrespectful but doing it anyway because you don't care. Cutting in line. Taking the last piece of cake instead of cutting it in half and sharing. Saying something off color in front of someone you know doesn't appreciate off color comments or possibly shouldn't be spoken in front of like that. (Children) That's rude. Unintentionally hurting someone is an ACCIDENT or a MISTAKE...those happen. When they do we apologize to those we hurt, try to make amends, and tell ourselves to pay attention in the future. The person offended says thank you, no problem, and forgives you because it was an accident. yes we all know reddit just hates bullying, unless it's someone they don't like of courseThere was a very athletic girl in my geometry class in 10th grade high school. Very popular. Her and her twin sister have very high metabolisms, so they never gain hardly any weight over the years. You can call them willowy if you like. I am fat, and I know it now as I knew it then. People just have to remind you. Well, periodically our teacher would reassign our seating and for a time I was right next to her. One day, class was winding down even though we were suppose to be working, and for some reason she decide to entertain herself by tapping me on my thigh. I was wearing shorts, so she had access. She would press her in finger in to make an impression, and then release, and continue. The first time I asked her what she was doing. She wanted to see how soft fat was. Well, I asked her stop several times.  Instead she increased the rate and pressure of the taping until she loudly declared, ""Look! I'm making waves!"" I was mortified, because most the people around me were in some way her friend and wanted to see. I pushed her hand away. And I'll never forget how ridiculous her reaction was. She jumped back with her hands up in a ""calming"" gesture and cried out so the whole class could hear, ""WHOA! Jesus, emh1389! What's with all the hostility?!"" If I could've only sunk into the floor... Everyone stopped what they were doing and turned to us, even the teacher.  ""What's going on?"" Mrs. Geometry asked. ""[AthleticGirl] keeps touching me."" It seemed so ridiculous. You could see their incredulity. ""I only tapped her arm!"" AthleticGirl said, ""She didn't need to hit me."" I told the teacher I only smacked her hand away after I asked her to stop. But apparently my reaction was unwarranted considering that AthleticGirl wasnt actually harming me. I almost got a detention and AthleticGirl was told not to touch me. She never touched me again that I recall, but she departed with:

""Why do you got to ruin all the fun?"" She snickered with her friends any time I made eye contact with her during the remainder of class that day. She made a point of it, and she made fun of me for a few weeks afterwards. She was very dramatic. 

It boggled and hurt me that someone could turn the whole situation on its head, making it my fault. If only she respected others bubbles like she cherished her own. :(This is basically what is taught to the rookies at retail jobs. 

""Tell them to stop and if they don't, talk to the manager"". 

Some people need to know the difference.When someone inflates a rubber container with air and then ties it into a shape of an animal that's *ballooning*.[deleted]Oh Bully! Could we get some of these for sexism and racism.You know what happens when you raise a certain age group to believe that anything that happens to them that doesn't make them feel awesome is some sort of intentional, malicious act that needs reporting?

You get protests and outrage about how everything they don't agree with is unfair and unjust.

""I don't agree with this email a college professor sent. I'm going to protest until they get fired because it's unfair for me to feel this way.""

""I can't believe how much in student loans I have to pay back, I'm starting a petition that says the government should forgive them because they're unfair.""

""The people who helped make David Bowie's music is taking his albums off YouTube, in hopes people will actually buy them. These people are petty because I want his music for free.""

""I'm so rich, I've never had to take responsibility for my actions, so when I got drunk and drove and killed someone, it's unfair that I be held responsible. I'll use that as my defense.""

I've met a lot of dudes who peaked in high school and still have the mentality of a 17 year old alpha male trapped in a 30-50 year old body. Living in a halfway house on a conditional sentence order from jail, banging a different ratchet ho from PoF every night and manipulating them into lending him smokes and money. Meanwhile he is still convinced he is king shit and dresses and talks the same as he did in high school. Always reminiscing about the glory days. You might think I'm talking about a specific person, but having previously lived in sober living facilities I've met dozens (if not hundreds) of guys like this. I almost feel sorry for them but eh, fuck em.[removed]When bullying means being an asshole.Pass this on to tumblrBullying has become a buzz word.  It has lost all meaning.

As someone with experience, the Kevlar helmet is designed to deflect or reduce the kinetic energy of ...... Shrapnel and spall, NOT bullets.   The same way we line our combat vests with Kevlar to absorb the shrapnel from the ceramic plate. It stops the now broken shards of razor sharp ceramic plate from becoming deadly spall.

Who is the artist?AZIZ! LIGHT!I just thought about my eyes, this can't be good for your sight. Is he using welding goggles?He drew it out in pencil, and then the dark pencil lines absorb the sunlight more than the white wood; the pencil lines burn while the white wood doesn't (unless he falls asleep).I wonder if the artist will be able to see the finished product once it is finished after all that glare.I wonder how he likes being blind?  That focal point is about as bright as a welding arc - just not quite as much UV.The picture is neat but I don't understand the point of using a magnifying glass considering a wood burning kit would make an identical result and take a fraction of the time.

Balding and sickly and anemic is he!

*Spongebob Leukemia Pants!* 

I have some health issues going on and have had quite a few mri's this past year.  I'm 25 and terrified, they give me something to relax, I close my eyes. And count along with the sounds.  I don't open my eyes until I'm out.  Seriously terrifying for me. My cousin designs these for a living!  He maps out the shape of the machine in a CAD program and then designs the decals around different themes. It's awesome. But...what about adults? Nobody cares about our stress?

I had an MRI when I was about 13. (I'd been fainting and my mom freaked out, turns out it was just anemia.) I wasn't afraid, more like mildly interested, since I apparently wasn't quite old enough to understand how scary medical procedures are. It was just like ""Oh, this is a thing that's happening. Ok then.""

Flash forward to my second MRI last year, when I was 31. I was fucking terrified. It seemed to be louder, take a lot longer, and was generally more traumatizing. I never want to be in one of those things again.

They should really be making the process more comfortable for everyone, not just the kids.I would take a CT scan over an MRI any day.

Check out his ted talk http://youtu.be/16p9YRF0l-g

Or his book ""Creative Confidence""Or a CT scanner, because that is not an MRII would like one for adults too, pleaseThere's a brilliant TED talk all about this! 

http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSanJoseCA-2012-Doug-Dietz-T

Basically, taking a scan requires patients to be absolutely still while inside. With kids, an giant narrow tube like this can be a very terrifying thing and could make a calm kid restless pretty quickly.So they created different ""experience"" rooms that transformed an otherwise scary procedure into an adventure! Doctors and parents would also dress as pirates and were encouraged to play along, making the kid think they're going to search for mermaids together and they had to stay still to not scare the mermaids.You know, in children's hospitals and maternity wards near my university all the halls and rooms are decorated whimsically like this. Why can't we do this in all the parts of a hospital? Adults get scared and nervous too :( ARE YOU READY KIDS?

I was in Cairo about 5 1/2 years ago and remember this road, but thought for a while ""maybe they were blocked by the haze,"" so I went through old pictures and dug up proof.

This road is in the hills to the east by the Citadel, about 9 miles from the Pyramids. You can totally see the Pyramids from there, [here's a pic](http://imgur.com/X4M9ahZ.jpg) with a pyramid circled (I had to really mess with the levels to make it noticeable).

For anyone saying that's an image artifact and not a pyramid, [here's Cairo Tower from roughly the same vantage point](http://imgur.com/g3C89Tq.jpg). It's 159 ft taller than the Great Pyramid and 6 miles closer to the Citadel.

I know Isis are shitheads but why do they destroy ancient buildings and antiques?R.I.P. man of ethics and morality.Perhaps some of the powerful sovereigns in regions **SHOULD STEP THE FUCK UP** and save their culture and history before it's wiped out by these assholes.


It's hard for me to be upset about this anymore.

I'm absolutely shocked at the loss of priceless history and the barbarism to kill this man over this, but if no one in the Middle East wants to stop ISIS, then I say the West should pull out, and let them have their cake.

There's no way we, with a foreign modern military, can go into a region like the Middle East and solve these problems by killing people.

Our foreign military can support and assist in a force led by a local sovereign, but we cannot lead a war over there and come out the winner, nor accomplish anything effective.

People have the right to self determination. If those people in the territory now controlled by ISIS, and those sovereigns around them want to allow ISIS sovereign control, so be it.**NEW GAME:** No more need to hunt and kill secondary game like lions and rhinos.  It's time to drop all of the poachers into ISIS territory armed to the teeth and wearing GoPros with instructions to bring back their heads as trophies.  Poach for your life baby!Fuck You ISIS!Wow.

RIP.As a historian I am really feeling that it is time for us to organize and begin seriously defending these sites. This man died with honor. I hope he finds peace. Will somebody plz take out those piece of shit fucktards? I hope if I ever face my own death like that I can have half the balls this guy did and tell them fuck right off. This guy is a hero and died as honorable a death as any man could hope for, die protecting and defending what you love and lived for.I was talking with a lot of redditors yesterday trying to understand how ISIS is able to recruit and hold so much control if seemingly no one supports them. 

The common answer from Muslims was that ""more Muslims support ISIS than are willing to admit it publicly"".  And that ""even if they don't actively support them, they tacitly support them by secretly agreeing with their actions"". 

That was concerning to me, and as much as I hate to agree with GW Bush, I can kind of start to see the logic of his ""If you aren't with us, you're against us"" comment. 

Seeing people like this man, get beheaded for such a noble cause kind of highlights for me how terribly evil this group is.  If you even *remotely* support what these people are doing, fuck you. 

This truly is a point in time where everyone needs to clearly pick a side. This is the kind of shit that we as a society can't tolerate. I guess real life is not like a movie. I wonder if he spent his last seconds wondering if someone would come to save him. I hate when good people have to die like this. fucking savages

RIP, real manAlpha as Fuck. ISIS - Tell us where you have the shit hid. Kahled - Fuck You.
I hope that I would have the Balls to protect my life's work.It's tragic that it often takes such villains to show us who the heroes are.

Was it posted?  We occasionally get deaths from people entering the glacial ice caves here in Washington.[deleted]Kinda depressing story ...

When I was 16 I went on an Alaskan cruise.  I got food poisoning and was in bed or throwing up through most of the trip, but I was well enough to watch the cruise through and past a whole bunch of glaciers next to each other.  One after the other.  It was amazing.  It felt like they were SO close to me and the ship.  Totally amazing seeing them all dead end into a big body of water.

So this year I went on the same kind of cruise again.  I'm 31 now and decided it was time to go and not get deathly ill.  It was a great cruise this time, but when it came to cruise past those VERY SAME glaciers ... they were almost gone.  They had receded SO FAR back up the mountains that we were hardly able to get close to them at all.  I had to use my binoculars just to see the detail I was able to see just looking out a window last cruise.  

The amount of melting, just in the short 15 years I had been there last, was SO fucking depressing to me.

tl;dr:  Went to Alaska 15 years apart.  Glaciers are disappearing.  We're fucked as a species.In the years to come when this is reposted kids will ask ""what's a glacier?""This image reminds me of a documentary of Inuit mussel-gatherers waiting for the sea ice to drop so they can break through the ice and harvest mussels before the sea rises again. Here's the documentary by BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMZYDQ6v24How thick is the ice above you? Seems like sunlight can get throughI now realize if Superman had his ice fortress it would have melted by now.

They're huge!How dangerous is that? I went camping at some ice caves a few years back (not inside, just near them) and there were signs everywhere saying to not go in them and if you do to not make any noise in them. In fact, a few months back a person was killed and some injured due to back to back collapses in a matter of days.

Here's an excellent explanation from NASA:

http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/30may_solareclipse2/

> ""Solar images formed by pinholes, crossed fingers, patches between leaves, all occur because of diffraction--a wave property of light. In the case of a pinhole, the light rays do not shoot straight by the rim of the hole, but bend around the edge. This wave effect creates a diffraction pattern of rings on the screen which resembles a bull's eye. That's for a flat wave single light source. If the aperture is illuminated by a scene, it acts as a lens to image the scene on a screen. With the right size hole relative to the right distance to a screen, a clear image is formed. That's the general principle of a pinhole camera.""
> 
> ""Applying this to an eclipse observation, the sun becomes the object to view. Point the pinhole camera at the sun and you see a solar image (projected on a screen) dim enough your eyes can enjoy.""
> 
> ""But the pinhole effect doesn't need a designed aperture. The solar image can be formed by any aperture if the shadow is the right distance away. The sunrays though tree leaves work to make a solar image on the ground below. Blinds on the window will covert a square opening into a round sun on the wall.""
> 
> ""The marvel is that diffraction doesn't need a round hole to form an image. A square pinhole will also work if its area is the same. Even for a random edged shape, the wave bending will average out to form an image of the scene contained in the incident light. That's why the spots of light through the trees are round; the gaps in the foliage are imaging the sun. ""I... Don't understand how the sun being partially blocked would change the shadows that a tree casts.Who's the dipshit building attack-speed Soraka?That's an amazing shot! The tree leaves act similar to how pinhole cameras work, [leaving these little eclipse casts](http://i.imgur.com/Y20dSSJ.png)Go see for yourself during the [next eclipse](http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/list.html) near you.For those doubting, it [works like this.](http://c.tadst.com/gfx/600x400/pinholeprojectionpaper.jpg)This guy. Think about all of the cameras pointed up at the moon when this was taken, and this smart guy is facing the opposite way.The last time a total eclipse happened in my area, I was 7 or 8. We were in school and we all went out with our two pieces of paper to see the pinhole effect. I was a hyper kid and my teacher hated me so as soon I started to get the least bit out of hand she sent me to sit on the curb in the shade and miss the eclipse. I was super bummed seeing as how I really liked science stuff. As I sat there I started to notice all the shadows changing around me. It was like millions of little pinhole eclipses all around me. All of the rest of the class was out in the parking lot with their shitty paper pinholes but I had my own personal light show. It was cool as shit. Thanks for bringing back that memory OP. It happensh here in Shcotland, too. My ash looksh like a shilver-birch! 
http://imgur.com/ZSbxkuLI know what's happening here! My physics teacher showed us an extremely similar photo. It's called a pinhole camera. The leaves in the tree have tiny little holes in them that the sunshine is passing through. This causes the image to be projected upside down on to the house like that. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera

Fun fact! If you wear glasses get a piece of paper and poke a tiny hole in it. Look through it without your glasses with one eye and you should be able to see clearly through the hole.Pretty sure if you had a staff with a gem on it you could stick it in the ground and use mirrors to uncover ancient secretsi saw this once in...1993 I think?

Luckily I was going to the engineering building and they has all kinds of stuff to look at it.  the best was looking through a compact disc.toenail clippings...everywhere.Looks like Porom and Palom just cast FlareAlso, during near-totality, overhead power and communication lines will throw sharp shadows. Normally they don't throw a shadow at all because they are much thinner than the sun's disk.Photographer and light enthusiast here. What you're looking at here is the camera obscura effect.

Basically a strongly emitting source of radiation is kept in a chamber with tubes leading through the chamber. Vials of samples get pushed into the chamber with an air shuttle kind of arrangement so they can get irradiated for analysis.

While the core of the reactor is housed in a heavy lead vessel, the rest of the reactor is made of cement with iron slugs used as aggregate instead of gravel. The iron chunks don't stop gamma emission as well as lead, but they do a better job than gravel.

One day, several trucks of cement were scheduled to begin casting of the walls of the core. The prof strenuously advised the construction foreman to only fill the trucks 1/3 full because the iron slugs would be considerably more dense than the aggregate they usually use. The foreman ignored the warnings, chalking them up as being the prattlings of an old naggy man and didn't give any orders to short fill the trucks. 

The trucks departed the cement plant charged with cement and iron aggregate and suffered eventual failure of all of their tires on the highway. They got stuck there loaded up with their massive overburdens of iron aggregate cement until their drum motors and bearings failed and the cement set inside the drums. They had to cut the drums apart off of the trucks  with plasma torches and jackhammers to clear up the heavy mess.Got any more details on location?

From where I was standing, I could see directly into the eye of the great fish. 

Mammal. 
Interesting. Though I'm a tad concerned that ""banana for scale"" will be replaced with ""bear for scale"". That could get dangerous.Why do the seagulls look so big?

Walk of shameThis reminds me of my old 'triever, Ben. Like most of 'em he loved water, even when he was reeeally old.

We went to house sit for some friends in Dorset (UK) when he was about 12 and cracking on a bit (actually lasted till 16 bless him). One day I took him and my much younger german shepherd Sadie for a walk, and we came across this sort of drainage ditch/ stream that was about as deep as I am tall and about the same distance across, so pretty deep and steep. Ben smells the water and, with a speed I didn't realise he was still capable of, decides to clamber down to it. He sank up to his belly in mud. I went in after him and tried to haul him out but the sides were too high - the best I could do was hold him in my arms against the side of the ditch so he didn't sink any deeper. We were good and stuck.

The antics of my frantic younger dog and my panicked shouts eventually attracted the attention of another dog walker, and I begged her to go back to where we were staying, about half a mile away, and get my mum. She headed off after tying Sadie to the bridge over the ditch for me.

I waited for what seemed like hours, probably about half an hour, up to my calves in pretty cold mud, covered in more mud and a copious amount of hair, holding an exhausted dog. I was wearing a sundress, so my arms and legs were covered in scratches as well. 

Suddenly, firemen! My mum had called them after hearing the description of the ditch. I have never been so happy to see firemen. In minutes they had placed Ben into a large tarp and hauled him out of there and pulled me out. Mum and Ben got a lift back in the fire engine but they couldn't fit me and Sadie, and I was pretty much a mud person by then. I didn't want to ruin my shoes so I ended up walking back barefoot with a frantic germen shepherd stepping all over my feet on a gravel road with no pavement.

By the time I got back my mum had made the firemen (must have been about 8 of them at least) cups of tea. She then got the hose out to start hosing Ben down and the bastard started running around the garden to get away from the water with all the energy of a dog half his age.

The firemen did offer to pressure hose me but I declined.

**TLDR - elderly dog tried to swim in a 6ft deep, steep sided ditch full of mud, I got stuck trying to get him out, got covered in mud, hot firemen rescued me looking like a cavewoman, dog regained enough energy to run away from the hosepipe afterwards.**How hard did you laugh?[deleted]I thought this was a honey badger from the thumbnailThat's the difference from a Lab and a Golden.

This is a sculpted rocking chair made in the fashion of famous furniture designer Sam Maloof, but with modifications to the design.
This modified version is designed and made by Hal Taylor (@HalTaylor_Rocks on IG).  
If you visit Hal's web page, this chair actually holds a very special and highly hypocritical back story.  You see, one of Hal's former apprentices once asked if he could use this design to make for himself, to which Hal said ""fuck no"".  The apprentice made one anyway and Hal was all ""argggghhhhh"".  Then Hal went on making reproduction Sam Maloof chairs for a living, just as he had before.
Edit:  Hal's web address.  http://www.haltaylor.com The store I'm referring to is at the bottom of the home page.  I'm not really trying to shit talk him, as Hal Taylor is easily one of the best chair makers in the country of this fashion (Maloof reproductions).  But if you build near reproductions for a living I think things can get a little funny.

Best work distraction since Reddit...Amazing job. Finally a good post. Quality and genius. Such cool birds. They're so fast and mechanical in their movements, like little flying robots. PROTIP: Throw a pack of red bee balm seeds in a corner of your yard by your windows. They absolutely go apeshit for red bee balm. We've been enjoying them for the last 3 summers in a row, as bee balm is a perennial.

Zero maintenance.Very cool pic. I love the stitched time lapse type of photos.

However, I am now irrationally afraid of being ventilated by tiny bug-birds.Hummingbirds mostly look at our feeder and then fly away. I realized tonight it's at least partly because we look intently at them whenever they come by. What can we do for more hummingbird action?!That's a beautiful image.
It reminds me of the work of Mike Kelley.

>From Wednesday, August 19, through to Sunday, August 23, the ninth Sail Amsterdam event will be held in Amsterdam. The popular opening parade runs for 12 kilometers and will consist of 50 tall sailing ships. Many of the vessels will have sailed there directly from Bremerhaven in Germany where another tall ships event ended last Sunday.

>In total, more than 1,000 vessels are expected to participate in the sailing extravaganza in IJ bay. Organizers expect up to two million visitors to attend the free event. According to them, Sail Amsterdam is the largest public event in the Netherlands - and the largest event of its kind in the world.

90% of dogs would be okay with a pet in that situation. 10% would not. Don't risk it. Sadly this is probably for insurance purposes.

This keeps your premiums from going up much higher than if you didn't have a sign or fence. Some municipalities also require it as well.

It was a miniature dachshund, I think her breed were known for being particularly nasty but this dog was the sweetest thing. 

She loved everything and everyone except one thing: The doorbell, her dreaded enemy. 

The doorbell going off was one of the few times we heard her bark. This dog was about 6-7 pounds at most but when she barked she sounded like she was the size of a husky.

It was the funniest thing, watching canvassers ring the bell and get this look of complete horror when the heard the barking. The look on their faces when they saw it was coming from a mini-dachshund was priceless.Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!I had a Siberian Husky that looked like a wolf. He was built like a machine, and looked ferocious, which was nice because I lived in a place kind of sketchy at night.

Twice my house was broken into with my giant direwolf downstairs & both times my dog barked & scared off the intruders.   
Instead of going to attack them, he was just saying ""Look at me"" then prancing towards him like a bubbly giant puppy hoping for head scratches.

People would cross the street to not have to walk near him, and he would bark trying to say ""Hey, I'm friendly please pat me on the head"" but everyone was scared of the love bug.

* siding is horizontal now instead of vertical. 

i wouldn't be surprised if your dad tripled the value of the house, if not more. when was the picture taken? Almost doesn't even look like the same house, your dad does great work!Is the house in the back a guest host or someone else's? [removed]Your house grew a new wing!Coming from a house built by my father, after 15 years of living here, we finally got the last room of the house finished a few weeks ago.... Kinda...
Anyway, your dad did a great job on your house, looks great!That looks extremely norwegian. Great on him for fixing up the house .At first I was like, *why didn't you take this from the same angle*, but then I realized the entire part on the right is essentially new. That's some serious renovation work. Very sharp lookingI love how the additions actually fit the architectural style of the house. So many shitty additions look like shitty additions.My uncle was only a carpenter as a hobby but his and my aunt's house is the same way.  It started out as a 1 bedroom house about as big a as a double wide trailer.  They've added 2 bedrooms, a den with a second story master bedroom above it, and a 2 car garage.  He's probably tripled the square footage.  Not to mention the couple of big storage sheds and deck he's also built in the back yard.That's a great looking house.I honestly really like the second window he added on the face of the house facing the camera You've got to be more than a carpenter to pull that off! Did he hire expertise for concrete, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or anything?In all seriousness it would be amazing to have those kind of skills. I'm in the process of having a home built by a builder and constantly think man it must be amazing to be able to build your own home or do your own major repairs because you already have all of the tools and the skills to do it. Plus he probably know all kinds of people in the trade that can take care of other trades like electrical or plumbing.Wow. Jeg så deg poste dette på Face. Interessant.Sons of construction workers can relate.

My dad extended the house by one room, and the top of that room became the balcony for the 2nd floor. Built 3 toolsheds that outlasted him.

Cal. Dept. of Water Resources is letting out so much water from the lake in order to keep salinity levels of the delta in check. When they dropped the flow down too far, salt water from the San Francisco Bay started to creep in. There are multiple reasons for this, one being environmental (the Delta Smelt...) and irrigation purposes. Although it's part of it, California, or rather, Folsom and Sacramento, are NOT drinking this lake dry.

Except now there's not even water to joke about.

Conserve water, drink beer.I thought kids floated?Never thought I would see Folsom, CA on the front page. /r/californiaswaterMeanwhile in south Florida, there hasn't been a single day in months where we haven't had at least six inches of rain. It's been torrential the world is ending rain every single day since at least April. As someone who grew up on Folsom lake this is a horrifying shot.. I used to go here as a kid and always saw the water go down but this is terrifying. Guess I won't be going back to Sacramento anytime soonThe kids can still play on the beach, just without the splashing around in water part...Looks like New VegasI'd be metal detecting the hell out of that place""No lifeguard on duty...*forever*""It's worth pointing out that people only used to swim there because some people dug a reservoir and dammed a river. It's not a natural lake. California has been living on borrowed water for a long time. No one should be surprised when the bill comes due.Drought is part of the natural water cycle in California. Yes, people expanded to where they shouldn't have, without better backup systems in place. Yes, we are have a particularly bad drought right now.

I don't exactly know how this cultural attitude changed, but people scoff at big projects these days. Covering the CA aquaduct with solar panels, for instance. Or William Shatner's proposed super-long pipeline. Folks should also look up NAWAPA, a plan in the 50's to do man-made water distribution throughout the western US. Hell, even William Shatner proposed a super-long pipeline of a similar nature.

Astonishingly, the notion of long pipelines immediately invokes visions of science fiction in people's minds. Then when you point out that the petrochem industry makes *colossal* pipelines all the time, that is somehow considered irrelevant.

I will immediately betray what I said above, though: this isn't a usual cycle, and we are seeing something change. The Salton Sea was left to die, and it is have a ripple effect in the ecosystem all along the coast. The desertification of the LA region was essentially halted with the creation of the Salton Sea 100 years ago. The existence of the sea sustained weather systems that made the LA region much more livable. Now that the sea is essentially gone, the greater LA area is undergoing a drastic desertification, with soaring temperatures and exposure.

The sea could be saved, too, but again, people scoff at it. A 90 mile seawater pipeline could be built from the Gulf of California to refill the Salton Sea. Cost estimates are somewhere in the $500m-1b range. Scoffing ensues, but you can look at school districts that issues bonds in the hundreds-of-millions range that are just absorbed into people's pockets. If you listen to Eisenhower and compare to military spending, $1b is a small investment compare to military build-up.

... and seawater is actually less salty than the Sea is now! The Sea is 200 feet below sea level, and the pipeline could be passive, if designed correctly. There is a huge dry lake bed in Mexico that could be refilled to an artificial sea, too, if the pipeline was properly built. A little tricky, since it is 80 feet above seal level, but by coupling it to to the -200ft Salton Sea siphon could also make this a passive benefit.

Even if pumping was added, solar or thermal collectors could be added along the length of the pipe, thus making it zero net energy. The economic benefit alone to both countries would likely offset the cost within a decade. The biggest problem would be dealing with Mexico, now that they are a essentially a failed nation.Kids these days have no imagination.

It's seriously fucking beautiful. I hiked up one of the mountains. Hiking up the mountain it felt like I died and was in heaven. Fresh cool air, sea breeze, the midnight sun, the clouds breaking over the mountain peaks, the wildflowers, the ferns, I could go on and on. It was basically an arctic rainforest because everything was so wet and overgrown with vegetation. There was fresh water everywhere, I did not have to worry about my water supply. Camped in a random clearing. Probably the best day of my life.

2nd best day would be the 8 hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo. Every minute of that 8 hour train ride has an /r/earthporn front page worthy view, for real. Listened to some Sigur Ros and it was just perfect.

http://i.imgur.com/k4ldvcU.jpgFormer bookstore employee, can confirm. Not sure what it's like now, but back then (20+ years ago... jeez I'm old) 90% of the time it was the book Oprah had talked about that day/week/month (I don't recall if she had her ""book club"" at the time or not, because I was a teenage male who did not own a television so 3 strikes against giving a shit about her show). 

If I recall correctly the ""green cover book"" was the Celestine Prophecy, the ""outside party after dark"" book was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Why do I recall these things... because I was asked the same question (more or less) a hundred times. 

This was before everyone had a cell phone, much less a smartphone, so there wasn't an easy way to ""look it up"" (this was when you still had to buy Netscape).

We would be ecstatic if you could add a caption or comment to this post mentioning our name and our website bluewillowbookshop.com!!The Fault in Our Stars isn't  in there.One time I was at a fairly large Indigo book store looking for a book I'd seen before online.  Of course I couldn't remember the name of it or the author, so I was just skimming through the section I thought it would be in.  A lady that worked there asked me if I needed help, and I was almost going to just tell her I was fine because I thought there's no way she can help me find this book.  But, i thought what the hell, let's give it a shot.  So i told what I remembered about the book, which was basically that it was 'kinda sciency' and 'had a red triangle on the front'.  She took a second to think about it, then ""Oh yeah, it's over here""  and then she took me a couple rows over, reaches down to the bottom shelf and pulls out the book I was looking for.

Did she just know where every book was?

Was she magic?Twist, all those covers are just dust jackets for other booksOh hell no. This actually happened. Couldn't tell me the name, what it was about our who wrote it but they had seen their friend's copy and it was (kid you not) blue. 

45 minutes of talking about the types of books the friend liked and narrowing it down slowly I found the fucking book. 

They looked at it, said ""oh, yeah. That's what it was called. Thanks"" and walked out of the store without buying a damn thing. 

Fuck that person. If it's have had a weapon, I'd have gone to jail. As a former B&N employee I can concur. This happened way too often, or they would have oddly specific irrelevant information. ""I'm looking for a book. It's got a tree on the cover and is 357 pages long."" 

My other favorite thing was when they would just say ""I'm looking for a book."" I would then grab the nearest book to me, hand it to them, and walk off. Pretty sure this is a reference to an old Vasquez comic called ""I Feel Sick""Missing the Blue Man Group bio.Forgot Catch-22I worked as a merchandiser of CDs for many years (until ipods tanked our sales).

It appears closer in the photograph than it does in streetview due to the perspective distortion of the telephoto lens used by the original photographer. However, if you look very closely, you can see many of the same landmarks. You can also see the changes/construction made between 2006 (when this photo was uploaded to [Wikipedia](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phuentsholing_Bhutan_Indien.jpg)) and 2013. Keep in mind this is an extremely humid climate.

This photograph just happens to be taken under the face of some construction that caused debris to fall into the as-yet-uncovered sewer. The sewer is now covered with concrete slabs, which now serves as a walkway with fencing and doesn't look that bad.

A further exercise would be to examine the nearby streetview on either side of the border. Then you'll see there is not such a disparity as is attempted to be portrayed whenever this photo is posted.They need to do the needful on the India side there. Couple things I noticed, learned, and saw when in India for business. I was in a city, so I can't speak for the rest of the country nor can I speak about rural areas. I did not live there, I only did work and left. And before anybody thinks I'm disrespecting India, I loved my trip and I'd go back.

1) Trash was thrown on street sides. Often people gathered it up and tossed it in large piles in more centralized areas. People rummage through the trash looking for food. Then animals do the same. Whatever is left either stays there or is taken by the poorest of the poor. During the rainy season, this trash often ends up in drainage systems which end up clogged so the streets flood. Then someone is sent in to clean the drains and that person often removes lots of trash and puts it back into the large pile. The cycle continues. While I was there for just under two weeks, three people died cleaning drains.

2) The most wealthy parts of the city look like most ""first world"" cities. They have very new high rise buildings which are well maintained, cleaned, and they employ lots of people doing lots of small jobs. When you have so many people to employ, things that are taken for granted in other places become a job for someone.

3) Everybody knows someone that can be paid to get something done. Here in the US you need licensed contractors to build buildings and you need licensed electricians and plumbers. You need to have a contractor or your utility company come hook up power, phone, sewer, etc. I experienced more pay-offs in my short time in India than I can even believe. Right down to my driver paying off the guards at my hotel to just let us through instead of stopping us every day for bomb checks. While this social system employs lots of people that take a small cut at every level, it's obviously rife with abuse.

4) The resources required to run a single unified nation with over a billion people in it is unfathomable. And since India is what many would consider a developing country, those resources are scarce and badly needed. Imagine trying to provide medical care for a BILLION people, many of whom make the equivalent of a few US dollars a year. Imagine the public works project that would be required to collect, sort, recycle, and properly dispose of trash for a city that has 20-20k people per square kilometer! Just the amount of trash produced is staggering and now you have to pay people to collect it and properly handle it?!


Again, I loved my trip to India and I'd go again in an instant. It really taught me a lot about the world and how I looked at it through the lens of my own daily experience. I saw human beings eating plastic bags for food. I also saw the Taj hotel. I saw things that made me uncomfortable like the tourist traps set up around the Mumbai terror attacks, and I saw beautiful city streets with big box stores and the nicest McDonalds I've ever seen. I think that extreme contrast changed me a bit for the better, but I can say that not every part of India looks like this, but I suspect a lot of the areas not chock full of rich people do.[deleted][California | Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Border_Mexico_USA.jpg)I wish we can see more left side tho but thats quite disturbingLooks like my gfs side of the bed vs mine. Seriously, Bhutan is the shit.

They have a law that says 60 percent of their country must remain forest.

The king is called the Dragon King. 

They are a country with less than a million people that sits on the border between China and India, and they have never been invaded by either one.

[deleted]Late to this and is probably going to be buried, but I have lived in Bhutan for approximately 3 years (2002, 2003, various summers) because my father was posted there (Indian Army has many projects in Bhutan). The Bhutanese are very clean, neat and organized people. They are warm and welcoming, but this is the border with West Bengal (Which is a shitty Indian state that other Indians hate too). While a lot of India is dirty, this specific state is known to be the absolute fucking worst. Also what you're looking at is just one aspect.

It feels like Pluto is taking a bunch of extreme selfies of itself all made up and doing unexpected things in an attempt to make its ex ND Tyson super jealousGreat post of picture...and not to wax too scientific in /r/pics, but this isn't really a ""sunset"", because Pluto basically rolls along its orbit with the axis tilted on its side (120° specifically) with regard to the plane of its orbit.  This means the ""north"" end of Pluto is constantly rotisserieing in sunlight, and the ""south"" end away from the Sun is in constant darkness.

So think of these as the mountains lining the way into Modor, constantly in twilight.Interesting to note the lack of crater activity. what are those layers in the atmosphere, and what's causing these mountain ranges to crop up? why does pluto have mountains but, say, the moon doesn't?for scale:

What are the causes of such enormous mountains? Plate techtonics? Impacts? I would love to know how tall those mountains are.Absolutely amazing.

You should see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion.  Now that's something.The title of this picture in /r/space is simply Close-up of sunset on Pluto.

It really shows how sensationalist /r/pics has become.If that doesn't convince the Flat-Plutoists nothing will.Do we have any idea how tall those mountains are? How do they take such wonderful pictures with so little light? How big are these mountains? Ballpark it or something i just need an answer.Earth is prettier...I officially call Dibs on Pluto.

There aren't enough activities on the planet to get me back on a cruise ship.  I've never been so bored on a vacation in my life.  Getting to the destination was amazing but everything in between was entirely forgettable.  Next time I'll just fly to Bermuda and stay at a nice hotel so I can get to know the place instead of trying to cram a week of exploration into three days.Aaaand they look like dildos[deleted]","{'Sadness': 0.163162, 'Emotional_Range': 0.752, 'Tentative': 0.71, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.121913, 'Analytical': 0.195, 'Conscientiousness': 0.394, 'Agreeableness': 0.443, 'Joy': 0.895942, 'Disgust': 0.045212, 'Extraversion': 0.359, 'Openness': 0.332, 'Anger': 0.539631}","{'window': 0.574443, 'church': 0.937027, 'stained': 0.995033, 'glass': 0.998167, 'stained glass': 0.975873, 'cathedral': 0.425557}"

Really fucking weird movie. Lonely dude pays random actors to pretend to be his family for his birthday. I recommend a watch, if you're fluent in Spanish.Hardly a new idea. Spanish painter Diego Velázquez did something similar on his famous painting 'Las Meninas', in the 17th Century.

The painting depicts the Royal Spanish infanta Margarita Teresa with her maids and other aids, taken from the point of view of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana who are at the same time posing for a portrait that Velázquez himself is depicted painting (left side).

The only clue we have about who is Velázquez painting in this scene is a mirror hanging at the back of the room, where the reflection of the king and queen can be seen.

Some guys had me trapped inside the engineering building (the game was only played outdoors), so I let Brian borrow my shirt and beanie. He ran out the front door and drew their fire. He continued running across campus and everyone who had been staking me out ran after him.  
&nbsp;  
I waited two minutes and then walked quietly back to my dorm.I was in a dorm where there was a girl who looked just like me, dressed like me, and even had the same major. 

She even walked and talked like me. It was rather unreal. Our names sounded similar, just one letter off, so people would call out to her and I'd respond, and vice versa.

My mother was visiting me once and I went to take a shower. At around the same time, my doppelganger got done with hers and began walking to her room. My mother saw what she thought was me going somewhere not my room and called out to me and she answered. I came out to see both of them talking and my first reaction was 'mom, that's not me!'

We've stayed in touch and she's now a researcher in the same area as I am. When I was quitting my earlier job, I referred her to that team and she got hired. My old colleagues say it's like I never left.

Edit: I saw her parents at graduation. They look nothing like mine, though the resemblance to her is clear. I'm also the spitting image of my mom except for my father's jawline, so I'm not adopted either. That made it genuinely cool for me.I read ""10 years ago I went off to college"" and thought, man, you must be old.

Then I realized that I started college 11 years ago. 

:lI am a neuroscientist. In biology/medicine, we use [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) to find articles, and authors are listed as ""LastName, FirstInitial SecondInitial"". I'm listed as Thompson CK. And since Thompson is such a common name, I'm not the only Thompson CK. In fact, there is another Thompson CK publishing in neuroscience, and occasionally I get emails for him, because his name is Christopher K Thompson, my exact name. 

Every year, there is one big neuroscience conference with 35,000+ attendees, and last year I emailed him to see if we can meet up. He comes to my poster, and I am just shocked at how similar her looks to me! I have two brothers, and he looks a lot more like me than either of them! Even more, he also happened to grow up in a town about 8 miles from my hometown. We both have degrees from the University of Illinois. We both really like pizza and beer. I mean, what are the chances...

Here is a [pic.](http://i.imgur.com/yoLulp0.jpg) I'm on the left. Funny enough, I had shaved my beard about 3 months prior to this pic being taken. If I'd left it on, we'd almost be twins. 
If Brian is Brian... And Josh is Brian.... Then where is Josh? Why is no one missing Josh? Brian looks like a guy I went to SPU with.

I was living in Barcelona and I was hanging out at a very popular youth hostel and I kept meeting people who would say ""Yeah, we've met, your Sean.""

And I never forget faces. Eventually I was like ""No, I never met you!""

And the response was ""Yeah, we met earlier, you are Sean from Baltimore"". And I was from Baltimore.

Turns out, there was another Sean from Baltimore staying at the hostel and meeting loads of people. 

Yeah, and he looked *exactly* like me. When we ran into each other in the hallway I instantly knew this was the dude. He looked at me the exact same way since he had been dealing with the same issue since we were both very outgoing people.

We talked for about 3 seconds and then both ran in different directions. I guess we were both freaked the fuck out that we were both Sean from Baltimore, short hair, same facial structure, same clothing style, same height, same build, same social personality...

I see Mr. Bean.This was the cause of my British moment ever: Today I was held up in traffic due to a bobby on a motorbike who was escorting Mr Bean. I swear I levelled up. Mr. Bean came out in 1990? Weird, I always think of it as being an 80's show. By far the greatest Electrical Engineer to graduate from Oxford. ([not joking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson#Early_life_and_education))Best episode, in my opinion.The first time I ever saw Mr. Bean was when a short episode played in a movie theater before Tim Allen's *The Santa Clause* in 1994. 

It was [the one where he meets the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JizFAhEpiEc), and at that point in all my 11 years, it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.[new whip](http://imgur.com/zfQ3xOx.jpg)I have always loved mr bean. Both my parents are deaf, and would always watch this show. Not only do I love it cos its a super funny show, and Rowan is amazing, but I always loved the fact my parents could watch it and understand everything! 

I wish I could let Rowan and everyone involved know just how important this show is to me.Better put a padlock on my car just to make sure no one steals it. Oh I'm going shopping, I better try everything in the store before I buy it. Man I have party guest over my house but no food, wait I got it chocolate covered twigs..... Teddy This scene is one of my earliest memories in life. I remember staying up late watching tv with my parents when this came on. I was so excited when he was going down that hill losing control of the brake pedal with his broomstick. The second he drove into the madras van, causing the HUGE feather explosion, I had my first case of laughter cramps! I laughed so hard i fell down the from the couch onto our coir rug. Thinking about fact that I fell down due to uncontrollable laughing multiplied the laughing with a factor 10 and made me lose track of time and pain from the fall. My dad had to pick me up to make sure I could breath. I like to believe that this is what shaped me into being the guy I am today, always trying to make people laugh and have fun.
PS. Screw Rupert and Hubert!So who is really controlling the car? That's so Bean... at least he's buckled and using a mop responsibly.Rowan, you beautiful bastard...Mr. Bean was awesome. English wasn't my first language but that wasn't necessary to enjoy it as a kid. I LIVE, I BEAN, AND I LIVE AGAINI googled him and I cant take any picture of him seriously.

On the red carpet, news, in a suit, in a tux even on the mans goddamn wedding day. It just looks wrong.

He will always be the hilariously retarded Mr. Bean to me.Can't we just turn this into a Black Adder quote-fest.  I'll start:

""Oh dear, it's Richard III"".The PBS Chicago affiliate used to show Me Bean episodes every Sunday night when I was a kid. I loved that show.He celebrates his own show?

Looks like the art for the ABUR dual land underground sea, which enters the battlefield untapped, and can be tapped for one blue or one black mana. It also has the basic land types, swamp and island.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/vanished.shtmlFour years ago I spent a couple days in the Dolomites at Passo Brocon in northern Italy. I took a long day hike up the mountains above the hotel and found a WW1 gunnery nest. It was mid-September and already pretty damn cool up there. I jumped inside the nest and looked around. The soldiers had a nice view of the area, but they were also totally exposed. The wind whipped over the little hilltop. Then came a sudden thunderstorm. I had nowhere to hide and got completely soaked. As I high-tailed it down the mountain to my hotel, I thought about those soldiers who were stuck in that nest in winter. Holy shit, that would have SUCKED. 

I got hot coffee and drove the 17 miles to town to get new shoes (mine were muddy and filthy). Those soldiers couldn't. They were stuck in the frozen mud for weeks at a time. And now some of them are unearthing. >the remains of two Austrian soldiers found on the Presena Glacier in 2012. Photo: Office for Archaeological Finds, Autonomous Province of Trento

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/10562017/Melting-glaciers-in-northern-Italy-reveal-corpses-of-WW1-soldiers.htmlI'm starting to believe nothing in [Encino Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xkTN1Z1rTQ) was scientifically accurate! So... Can these corpses be viral carriers?Imagine that being you. Just dead, nobody knowing for sure whether you died or just never returned, nobody knowing how you died or where you were; and when your body *is* finally discovered, anybody who would've cared is dead now too.It's kind of crazy that when that guy woke up that morning he had no idea he would be killed and begin a 100 year journey through a glacier that would end in 2015 where his picture would be posted across the world for people to look at on their phones, computers, at the bus station, a restaurant, or even sitting on the toilet. I bet he would have stayed in bed had he known that. Captain Italia looks like he needs a little time to readjust They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead, the most fearsome and terrifying of the whole Dead Army. Since the line of Otto von Bismarck had ""ended"" (after a hundred years), no one could call upon the Dead Army to aid them in their hours of need, as they would only answer to an Heir of Bismarck. And my hunt for Captain America has just made a little bit more progress. Just imagine that was probably some poor woman's husband that she never heard from again...Grim? Check. 
Frost bitten? Check.
Death? Absolutely.

This content is black metal certified. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.If they were frozen in glaciers, why are they not better preserved?Now that's what I call Italian ice.Draugr de Italiana.If anyone is interested in WWI, there's an awesome channel on YouTube that has been doing videos on what happened that week 100 years ago. I highly recommend it.

I'm sure there are a few bad ones, but from experience the ones I've met have always been friendly, helpful and kind. Never have I seen one going on a power trip. They spend a lot of time actually serving the public.Netherlands mentioned?

KARMATREINI was in Amsterdam one night smoking a big joint on the street - blazed out of my mind - when two cops walked towards me. For a moment I freaked the fuck out and was about to toss my joint. Then I remembered that I was in Amsterdam. The cops just laughed at me and kept walking. Good times.Grime fighters. I think everyone is missing the point here. There are two hot cops in her house cooking and doing dishes. I don't think I've ever been more turned on. Lol. there really are good cops everywhere, just the bad cops make more headlines. 

the night my grandma passed away. she called the police because she was scared. the cops came  and sat with her for 3 hours. they didn't need to do that, but they were comforting her. those were the last two people who saw her alive unfortunately, but i'm glad there were some nice people looking out for her. 

she passed away later that night, no one could have known that was going to happen.The one on the left is a total babe. He can wash my dishes, if you know what I mean.

Goede actie.Just an FYI to the folks who are confused about hypoglycemia...most likely this woman has diabetes, probably Type I which is insulin dependent. Anyone who has this knows what a royal pain in the rear it is...constantly checking your blood sugar, adjusting your food intake, insulin intake, activity level to attempt to simulate a non-diabetic's blood sugar. Even with constant vigilance, your blood sugars can dip low or go high, for sometimes unknown reasons (is this infusion set on my insulin pump blocked? I worked a little harder raking the leaves and didn't eat enough...I have a cold, maybe that's why my glucose is high? Etc). Managing the disease is a total balancing act. This mom prob went into hypoglycemia because it was dinner time and she was going to eat soon but her blood sugar dropped too low before she got a chance to eat,and she got confused or was behaving abnormally or became unresponsive. Scary stuff. I am glad the police helped her out like they did. Serious respect for these guys. They're the model that all policeman should follow.

Also I hope at least one of them is single.And these are the guys that had to fight and go on strike to get a better CAO (collective agreement), incomprehensible. Goeie jongens.Most of redditors are from Netherlands.I was reading this thinking ""Woah! This is totally unheard of!   ... Oh, Netherlands, well then it makes sense""

Edit: I was just expressing my initial reaction to reading this. You're all right of course, that there are plenty of American police with good intentions, and it gets drowned out by either bad cops or just that it's hard to be nice when you're surrounded by gang violence...  FTP - Fix The Police ... And also inner-city/organized crimeIf this had happened in the United States the woman would have hired a lawyer and sued the cops, their department, and the city.  Well when the crime rate is so low you don't have a couple dozen report/complaint calls stacked up to go to after the current one (not to mention whenever high priority calls come in in-between) you've got time to cook dinner and do dishes. 

 Personally, I think the good cops (not the minority haring trigger happy ones) would have a much better time at ""community relations"" if they were better staffed or crime was lower.  This is probably why old people remember friendly cops who they got to know and such. Those cops has fewer calls and more time to reach out.Tijd om 112 te bellen! Ik ruik m'n afwas vanaf hier...Not gunna lie, hypoglycemia is a bitch. I lived in Eindhoven for a while and can honestly say it's one of my favourite places, if only because everyone seemed so nice and welcoming.

Dafoe has a certain kind of crazy look that befits Two Face's identity crisis a lot better. He pulled it off well with Green Goblin and a more comic-version of Two Face (who acts a bit different from movies and games) would suit Dafoe really well, I think.

He could probably do Joker crazy just fine too, but I think Two Face would end up coming out better.Simple, his dick is too big.Already been the Green Goblin.Easy - he doesn't want his ass kicked.

He'd be waaay too convincing and the next thing you know, the real Batman is showing up at his place throwing elbows and grunting all throatily. How about for a Batman Beyond movie?He can't be.

It was one of the most surreal moments of my youth. the second photo captures just about everyone's reaction they would have if they just finished a tough climb and the skyline fucking exploded. I live in Washington and remember that day well. I was 13 years old. Myself and a friend had ridden our bikes a couple miles from home to go shoot our BB guns. We had gotten to our destination, taken a few shots, and saw some big dark clouds in the distance. Really big. Really dark. It looked like rain clouds so we started racing home trying to beat the downpour that we thought was coming. A couple minutes later the clouds caught up to us and it started snowing. Well, it looked like snow, but it was ash.  We couldn't really see very well by this point and it was getting pretty uncomfortable to breathe. We saw some headlights coming down the road and it was basically pitch dark at this point. The headlights stopped revealing a truck and the driver yelled at us to throw our bikes in the back and he would take us home. I remember we had been reading in school about Hiroshima and nuclear bombs, and I was pretty sure we had been nuked. The driver told us that ""Mount St. Helen's just blew up"" and I had no idea what the hell he was talking about but hearing the words ""blew up"" reinforced in my head that this was a nuclear war...or the start of one. Got home and saw the news.

That is how I found out that we have volcanoes in Washington and that I wasn't witnessing the start of World War 3.""Well, it's a good thing we didn't climb that one today.""I would just like to point out that in these pictures, Mt. St. Helens is 34 miles away. There had to have been some type of sonic boom that was out of this world seconds after they noticed the eruptionEven more intense are the [last photos from Robert Landsburg](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/234721-robert-landsburgs-brave-final-shots). 

""When the mountain exploded, he already had his camera on a tripod, aimed and cocked. As the all-engulfing cloud of ash climbed the sky toward him, four miles from the summit, he desperately cranked frames by frames across his lens, then rewound the film into its cassette inside the camera, wrenched the camera from its tripod, and stowed it in his backpack. His wallet was in the backpack too  perhaps to assure future identification.

Seventeen days later, his body was found in the ash, together with the film that cost him his life. It contained not only telling images of the killing edge of the blast but also the scratches, bubbles, warping, and light leaks caused by heat and ash, the very thumbprint of the holocaust.""I lived about 120 miles north, up in Snohomish, when it blew. Most of the ash ended up in Eastern Washington. [It turned day into night over there.](http://ecologicalsociology.blogspot.com/2010/05/it-was-30-years-ago-today.html)

edit: link My aunt and uncle struggled through the Great Depression then worked hard their entire lives. Finally they retired and built their dream retirement house on the banks of a river than flows from Mt. Saint Helens. Only a couple of months after moving in the mountain blew and they made it out with their lives with minutes to spare. Lost everything they owned except what they were wearing. Luckily their daughter had married a very rich guy and could take them in. But they never really recovered from the shock and died within a year or two after. I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time, and all I remember is that shit just about knocked me out of bed. Incredible BANG that shook the whole house, particularly my bedroom window. I hiked around Mt. Saint Helens in 1996, the side of the mountain that exploded was nuts.  There were areas where we were walking across fields of 1/2-inch round pumice that was deeper than you could dig, and then you would walk around a corner and be back in the forest for another few hundred yards, and then you would hit a line and back to the pumice field.  It was probably as close to walking on the moon as you can get without actually walking on the moon.  One of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.I watched it from our garage door about 30 miles to the upper left of this picture (meadow glade WA). Could never wrap my head around people selling the pens with ash in them...we could have made millions!Found this guy when reading up about this picture, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Randall_TrumanAny time I see Mt. Saint Helens photos I'm always reminded of Crater Lake (for obvious reasons). The crazy part is that native tribes were in the region when Mt. Mazama blew up to eventually become what we know as [Crater Lake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Crater_lake_oregon.jpg). Mt. Saint Helens was a huge deal even with the geology and volcano knowledge we have today. I can't imagine what had to be racing through their minds when Mt. Mazama erupted.

""Prior to its climactic eruption Mount Mazama had a summit elevation of about 3,700 m (12,000 ft). The present high point is Mount Scott at 2,721 m (8929 ft), 3 km (about 2 mi) east of the caldera rim. Today, the caldera rim ranges in elevation from approximately 2,040 m (6,700 ft) to 2,484 m (8,150 ft)""
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/crater_lake/crater_lake_geo_hist_133.htmlwhoa. thats terrifying. As a climber, theres always this thought in the back of your mind when you climb a volcano (even a dormant one) that it *could* erupt regardless of how incredibly unlikely that event is. Seeing this must have been a mix of emotions, awe, terror, dread, wonder, and concern for any one effected. 

Also, i'm 100% certain that those climbers were now facing extreme difficulty in returning to Seattle or Portland and were likely in danger from transportation/ash related problems. This is incredible. I don't think there's anything else to do at a moment like that except watch in awe.I was in Seattle when it blew and we all heard it. My dad and I flew from Seattle to California a couple hours later, and they changed our flight plan to go around it. I was a kid and didn't quite get the significance of what I was seeing, but my dad was jumping around in excitement climbing over people to get photos. He was a medical dr but his hobbies were geology and mineral collecting. (the mineral collection he spent his life collecting was donated to the Geology Department at UCLA and is in display cases lining the hallways of the geology building , if anyone is interested. Anyway, I think the guy in the window seat thought my dad was going to climb in his lap Would you stand and watch or run like heckDid they survive?If you're ever in the area be sure to visit Mt.

[From another angle](http://i.imgur.com/WO3Np9e.jpg)One of the reasons why Canada built CANDU reactors is because we don't have steel forges the built giant reactors like this.  CANDU reactors are stacked in smaller modular sections.  It was important to the people in charge at the time we build the reactor ourselves to have something to be proud of.  Footage of forging at a similar scale. Pretty mind blowing.

I already have a random deep fear of butterflies and moths but holy shit these things are fearless and fly at your face and because it's fucking illegal to kill them and they know it they're just smug little shits. Hello fellow Iron Ranger brother!I guess you should talk to your doctor to see of Lunesta is right for youThat would be a male Actias luna, often mistakenly referred to as the lunar (rather than luna - see epithet) moth. Though fairly commonly, they're somewhat rarely seen because of their relatively short week-long adulthood. During this period of their lifespan, they do not have mouths, as a result do not eat, and exist solely to procreate.This obviously was staged by the moths for the sake of bankrupting the butterflies. We used to have a shitload of these around when I lived in South Carolina. One night, I was just outside with some friends and one landed on my hand. I might have loudly shouted and flailed around like I was on fire.[deleted]Ah!  Just saw one of these in a painting called [Flight Pattern by Rob Evans](http://www.robevansart.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/FlightPattern1.jpg), I thought it was the artist's creation./r/goodyearweltMaybe i should try posting my lunar moth again....it got downvoted last time but today seems to be a good day for lunar mothsIt looks hungry.

This just goes to show that you should never not respond to bad service because you think ""they won't do anything""What kind of car do you drive? Replacing a cabin air filter is not worth anything a dealership will make you pay. One of the easiest things to maintain in your carAt my oil change place they charged $20 for the filter and did a free install.You've made a nice return on that written complaint.Luther Bloomington? Damn I went to Walser.

Also, wheres the Minnesota karma train?It's not *price gouging*. I think you should probably look that phrase up. It's just a price that was out of touch with the market, and then corrected. /r/HAILLocalbusiness?As someone who works at a car dealership: WowMy sister recently bought a 2007 Honda CRV, took it in for an oil change and they suggested replacing the cabin air filter because it was ""extremely dirty."" She was surprised and asked the mechanic if they replaced it yet. He said they hadn't but they could do it for 55 bucks. She asked if he could show her the dirty air filter that's in her car first. He was hesitant but she insisted on seeing the filter. They walk over to the car and from behind the glove box the mechanic removes a pristine air filter. To which my sister says, ""Will you look at that, that air filter that I replaced last week still looks new."" The mechanic apologized and said someone must have marked the paper work incorrectly or was thinking of a different car.  Sure they did...[deleted]>indicated that *are* price point...

This glaring error upsets me more than it should. My car wouldn't start. So I took it to my Ford dealership because I had 150$ credit. They said it was my battery. I paid 100$ for it because it had a long ass warranty and I was like fuck it. Next day it didn't start again. They said it was my alternator and it would cost 700$. I told them that is insane and hung up. They called back and said they talked to their manager and took 5% off. I laughed and hung up.

I installed the alternator myself for total of 120$ and 30Min to an hour of work. This being my first time looking at youtube videos.

Turns out that wasn't it.

I took it to a mom and pop shop and they fixed it in 4ish hours (dropped it off before work)for 100$ total and said the air condition was drawing power.

The Ford dealership makes money on commission. My theory was they were going to claim it was the alternator and charge me 200-300% overcharge and then fix the air conditioning problem and claim it was the alternator.

Fuck those crooks.Not bad. At the dealership I get my car serviced at they tried to hit me up for $1,900 in bullshit. All I needed was a 25k mile service. I thought out loud and asked him ""are you fucking serious?"". I could see the terror in his eyes and that's worth more than any gift card.Now come get your air filter so we can sell you something else and charge you up on labor to make up for the gift cards.Wow!  That's a pretty great decision on their end.  I'd do business with them.  Cabin air filters are like $10 and can be changed in like 5 minutes.  Save $40-60 and do it yourself.Kia is kinda getting their shit together over the past few years Nice try Luther Automotive Group!Wow, grammar is *not* that dude's strong point.Of course this is from a Minnesota dealership, we pride ourselves on being too nice.Omg, the typos...That are price point.And...?

- Peacock, probablywhen i was growing up my neighbours had a massive iguana (7 foot long), it was basically a vegetarian alligator. 

He was actually really chill, loved to sit on the back of their couch and sun himself.. until one day in February when I walked into their house wearing my favorite red toque with a huge pom-pom on top.. now King (yea.. they called it King) decided the big red head was a serious threat and needed to be promptly dealt with. From his usual position on the back of the couch he was right at the door and at just the right height to bat me in the head with his tail (that probably made up 4 of his 7 feet and was at least 2 inches across at the base). 

Fucker knocked me out cold.. I woke up to the parents leaning over me and freaking out / appologizing, saying he'd never done anything like that before etc. etc... I was fine.. but I still don't like lizards..

I didn't have any destination I wanted to explore. It is a big city, but it is also not big.

The thing that amazed me is that architecture and history you can find that are off the main tourist areas. You can walk and see a building 400 plus years old with old historic doors. Inside a courtyard with cobble stones and people living their lives in buildings that would be historic in America.

You can walk by and go inside many churches hundreds of years old that people still use. See one of the small Museums that dot the city. Walking you can find the most amazing restaurants, grab a quick drink and see the city move around you.

Maybe I should feel bad, but when walking Paris I couldn't help to think to myself I am glad the French left the war early and it was spared destruction in the war. I get weird Devil May Cry vibes from it.Pretty sure that's also the door from Casper... or at least very close to it. An amazing example of art nouveau.First stop after retirement: Paris. Any takers?  I speak French. Must see it before it's detroyed in some dumb money/oil war.Belle Epoque was the epitome of that kind of design. It died with WW1 and the end of the European empires. I wish Art Nouveau would return. It was very labour intensive but perhaps CNC, CAD and 3D printing will see it return in a updated fashion. Its so florid and strikes me as 'human'. ""Arts Craft"" in many ways is a distilled version of this, boiling designs to their bare, hand made essentials.

It must have seemed like the end of the era of Legend, to those who born in this period, grew up and then served in WW1.We not talking about the massive cock  on the door? Reminds me of a pun in French/English. 

""Je t'adore""

I agree. Natural photos always look so much better. Maybe that's just because we normally don't see people ""trying"" to look a certain way for a picture and we just see them how they normally are.

I used Internet memes as the inspiration for a lot of them, because they are our physical Internet connections - chances are images like AstroSloth and Awkward Seal, etc, had already been transmitted through these boxes before I painted them.

Although it makes me realize just how inadequate I am when it comes to producing any type of piece that could be considered art :/""I-guana feel pretty!"". Hahaha, no? Okay...Is it okay if I submit some pictures to a Dutch weblog? I think they would like it. Hmm...

And how long before you think these will need a touch up or new image? Thanks for posting! BETAAAA!!!Please tell me I'm not the only one who thought that was Patrick in the background? I was convinced until I noticed a few oddities..

I can't be the only crazy one.. *impossible*I like how the eye is realistic looking, like there's a lizard inside of the painted lizard.  Just waiting to get out.  Also, is your username pronounced PaulFuckinWalsh?This is going to sound really weird, and probably out of place, but I had a really good friend named Paul Walsh who died 2 years ago. I keep seeing his name everywhere around the world, whether it be through other people who had the same name, or just the name ""Paul"" I see popping up on TV or the internet. I almost feel as if he's still here with me. Anywho, keep up the good paintings Paul!Quality! Some will see this as graffiti but this is far from that, put this on canvas and I believe it will sell, do you have more to share?I drove past as you were painting this in Mt Albert yesterday Paul!

Such a rare pepeThat's a telephone cross-connect box.I absolutely love the painted utility boxes! I'm starting to see them everywhere where I live and work ( Ca bay area and santa cruz), all done by local artists. I think it's a great way to brighten up the city a little bitCome to my neighborhood please.As a utility locator, my job would be a lot more entertaining if all the cross boxes looked like that!  Great job!  Portal is live folks! Prepare your submissions!Every single utility box in San Jose, CA is painted extremely well.

The five individuals, hunched over in downcast isolation, await their rations of food, playing out an all-too-familiar scene from the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s.

As /u/and_what_army said then:

> This family has already been through hell. A child with seizures is hard enough, but by the time they go on a Keto diet it usually means traditional treatments have been exhausted and all the normal medicines (Banzel, Klonopin, Depakote, Diastat, Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, and probably others) don't work. Keto as a medical treatment is much harder than Keto for weight control. Fletcher probably had to go into the hospital for 2-3 days while he adjusted to being on the diet, and now everything that passes his lips must be weighed to the 1/10th gram. He probably can't even wear the wrong kind of sunscreen, because anything on the skin could affect the body chemistry for the Keto diet.I ordered a bag of glow-in-the-dark toys for kids who want them or who can't take candies. I also printed signs that read, ""**Toys available for kids with allergies. Shots available for adults with kids.**""

I spent more on Jameson and little plastic glasses than toys and candies, but it's probably a decent investment to build some goodwill for my first Halloween in the neighborhood.

Edit: Thank you, anonyperson, for the Gold. It's a real treat.My son does not have medical restrictions on his diet.

Nonetheless, I eat his candy.

Because I am a responsible parent who goes the extra mile.Here's what I do as a crazy irresponsible parent with a kid who is actually severely allergic to peanuts (I say actually because many people claim to be who aren't, seriously).  We go trick or treating and do not burden our neighbors with anything.  Fill up the bag with whatever!  Then when we get home we break out the safe treat bag and start the trading.  He couldn't care less because he doesn't know what he's missing and loves red-vines, skittles etc.  We can usually redistribute most of the unsafe candy back out to the remaining trick or treaters, and what is still left over goes to work with me (although it might not all make it further than my desk).

First lesson with allergies; it's on you to manage it.  I've had people actually say to him ""no it doesn't have peanuts in it, just peanut butter.""  He learned how to read ingredients at 5 and he's managed it pretty well.I had a step child with PKU and a child with other unrelated food allergies. Our solution was to let them go hog wild on Halloween and get as much candy as they could. I would then pay them $1/pound for the candy and we would go and buy a toy the following weekend. I'd take the candy to work and then I didn't have to worry about the kids sneaking candy they shouldn't have, they got to experience Halloween the same way as all the other kids, and they got a new toy. It seemed to work pretty well. Just a thought for parents who would like their kids to have the experience but don't have the time to send out nice fliers with attached toys.Plot development: One of the receiver of the letter bought an angry bird costume and introduced himself as Fletcher on halloweenThis is the kind of thing my cousins family would do. Ever since he was an infant he's been deathly allergic to a long list of things (walking past a boiling pot of wheat-based pasta once triggered an asthma attack from the vapour). 

The family didn't turn the house into a bubble, they didn't ban anything coming into the home. They just made a little sign on the door informing people that someone with severe allergies lives there and to please follow some basic steps to avoid any issues (they'd always mention it to a first-time visitor though). Simple things like ""Please wash your hands after eating or handling any food products"", having a cupboard strictly for his dishes and food, no perfume. 

*He* was taught to watch for things, wash his hands religiously, and to bring his own stuff (like popcorn to theatres, letting the staff know of the allergies), not to rely on other people who probably have no clue. He's nearly 20 now and still very much alive.

In many ways it's comparable to a disability. Yes society adapts to a point but it's really up to individuals to learn how to live with it.

(Edits for clarity...and spelling)Active vs. Passive parenting. Not trying to bash the other post, but *this* is how to properly handle your child's allergies/diet on Halloween.This doesn't belong to me, but the 'responsible' parent who posted about her kids peanut allergy pissed me off and reminded me of this awesome parent. 

EDIT: Wow this really blew up! jumped 50 upvotes in 1 refresh! 

EDIT: Front page! thanks

EDIT: GOLD! Thanks!This could just be an elaborate ruse to find out ahead of time which houses to skip over in order to maximize the Halloween haul. 

My record is 5 1/2 large pillow cases loaded with candy within the 2 hour window, but this type of info could really help me out. After all, I turned 37 this year, and my legs aren't quite what they used to be.How irresponsible to name your child ""Fletcher.""With all the weirdos, allergies, and special diets out there these days, it's really a wonder that trick or treating even exists anymore. I have epilepsy and had to go through this same ordeal. However, instead of parents handing out toys, my parents just said I was too old to trick or treat. 

... I was 6. Lame...A real parent would sue all the candy manufacturers and each household that gave him candy.

Most of this image is just a beautiful landscape, but the addition of a few strikingly peculiar rock formations implies magical forces at work and an alien sentience of some kind.

People who made snow art at my school could only make one thing.Putting that art degree into use.School Master of the Custodial Arts.  Or a janitor if you want to be a dick about it.This reminds me of a janitor in my grade school named Charlie. He would clean our classroom every day after we left and sometimes he would leave really fun and cartoony drawings on the chalkboard. These weren't your average doodlings though. These were drawings that were on par with Disney and Bluth. The drawings would reflect the state of the classroom's clenliness. When the classroom was clean we were treated with cute and happy cartoon animals, but if the room was particularly messy then we'd either get a character with a look of disapproval or worse, nothing at all. The only reason we even knew his name was because he would deftly write it on the board next to his drawings. It showed that he was proud of his work. His signature was one-of-a-kind and its image is burned into my memory forever. Charlie had become a legend, and not just in our class room, but throughout the entire school. We didn't actually ever see Charle until the end of the year and it was like meeting Santa Claus. The next year I moved up to the middle schoot, so no more drawings from Charlie. Thinking back on it now I'm wondering what became of Charlie. I wonder how such a talented person became a janitor at a grade school. Maybe being able to make a few children smile was his reward for having an otherwise unrewarding job. Maybe his work as a janitor was short lived and this time was simply just a transitionary period for him. Whatever his path and wherever he may be now, I just wanted to say thank you, Charlie. Thank you for making a positive lasting impression on my life and helping to make me realize that some of the most beautiful things in life can come from the most unlikely of places.

TL;DR I had an artistic janitor too and it was awesome.Well, that's where art students end up.What the fuck is v1.std3.ru?? Can someone please mirror it to imgur or similar?

Thomas Jefferson Also said this 

* God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ...And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.""

November 13, 1787, letter to William S. Smith. I do believe the context is the French Revolution. 

* bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse.""

While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind.

Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."" - Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, August 19, 1785

Damn he foresaw the NFLAnd that's why we have the ratification and amendment processes.  To ensure that proper changes are made, and not radical changes at the whims of the fickle children, destabilizing and fracturing the Historically fragile process of peaceful administration of power across a broad range of cultures.

There's a *reason* presidents can't just override those limitations on federal power.  Fickle, flighty, unstable people are tempered by a stable government.  That it CAN'T react quickly and severely is one of its better traits.

E: So a person with grammar hangups can sleep tonight.That's some sweet center justification on that paragraph.Kind of ironic they etched his words in stone, eh?Thus the founders gave us the ability to amend the constitution, not ignore it. I doubt few here would say that the first amendment doesn't apply to modern media and the fourth amendment doesn't apply to your cell phone.""The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."" - Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book (quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria), 1774-1776We should make killing people illegal.

If this post is not a swipe at people who champion the 2nd amendment, I'll humbly delete my comment.Probably took it from John Lockeanything to restrict somebodies right to libertyYah I agree with him, but Thomas Jefferson would fight to the death to keep gun rights, he was very, very pro personal gun ownership to keep the state at bay. riding the karma train with the gun control issue i seeThis is one of those quotes that people read and then immediately come to the conclusion that Jefferson would have supported whatever changes to the law and constitution they want.

Liberals read it and think, ""See, Jefferson was in favor of changing the 2nd amendment.""

Conservatives read it and think, ""See, Jefferson would have favored repealing the 16th amendment.""

Libertarians read it and think, ""Damn it, why didn't more people listen to Jefferson...?""I assume you're posting this in reference to the UCC shooting? The means for the change that he's talking about here are laid out in the Constitution that he helped write as well... I'm not sure the point you're getting at? Would you call for a constitutional convention to get rid of/change the second amendment? Or would you call for gun control laws? If it's the latter I feel like it's hypocritical in this context, because you'd be willing disregard the 2nd amendment, contained in another document that he helped write...

If you're saying we need to call a constitutional convention, I still disagree, but that's a fair opinion and I can see why you feel that way.""...I advise the gun.

-Thomas Jefferson""To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers, have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.""

The measures advocated after Sandy hook wouldn't have worked in this case. 

As for the quote. I think Jefferson would've been shocked by the military power of the state compared to the individual. People arguing that semi auto weapons in the hands of the citizenry are too dangerous while the government has tanks, attack helicopters and nuclear submarines might even seemed absurd to him.

*Tell Ea-nasir: Nanni sends the following message:

When you came, you said to me as follows : I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots. You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!

What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Samas.

How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.

Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.*

[Link](http://laughingsquid.com/an-ancient-babylonian-customer-service-complaint-inscribed-on-a-clay-tablet-around-1750-bc/)I buy & sell copper in all forms for a living. This is an incredible example of how little this industry has evolved in the last 3000 years. 

There are still smelters who despite modern equipment and advancements; ship sub par quality and expect to call it chocolate. They also hold the buyer's money ransom as most producers demand money upfront. Any quality complaints take anywhere from 30 days to 2 years to dispute and clear up. Some cases the disputes are never sorted and get tied up in legal systems. Arbitration through various agencies is also usually ineffective as supplier or buyer are not really legally bound by their ruling.

> Luke, the male African lion at Smithsonians National Zoo took a break from his afternoon bone to watch the snowflakes fall in Washington, D.C. Although it does not snow in his native Africa, Luke seemed content to lie outside of his heated den and finish his lunch, occasionally shaking the snow from his mane. Luke and the Zoos three female African lions can been seen at the Zoos Great Cats exhibit.

Luke is [approximately nine years old.](http://www.e-torch.org/2010/03/reason-to-take-pride-at-the-national-zoo/)Luke the lion was born domestically at a zoo in Washington. He was famed for being one of the most talkative domestic lions around. Whenever a group of onlookers started clapping for him, he would give them a big, theatrical roar. They eventually started using him for breeding. They bred him with a lioness called Zira. Luke became enamored with zira. He refused to mate with any other lioness presented to him. He even taught zira to roar for the crowds. Whenever the zoo keepers separated the two. Luke would stay in the corner of his holding area with his head down until she returned. They eventually had to move Zira to another zoo temporarily for breeding purposes. After an abnormally long absence, Luke became determined to find Zira. He climbed the holding wall and went loose into Washington. This picture was taken three days after he escaped. He was shivering and showing early signs of pneumonia. All to find his lioness. He knew she was trouble when she walked in. Now He's lion on the cold hard ground.  ""... I hate it here.  Sigh...""Perfect AslanWhy nobody is commenting how beautiful this picture is?Reminds me of turkeys looking up at the rain.What a beautiful creature. If I was a dentist, I'd shoot him with a crossbow to express my gratitude.I think I saw luke when I was there. He was repeatedly roaring and gathered quite the crowd. I wonder why he was roaring like that.Aslan!!!Serious question:  how do animals that normally live in warmer climates adjust to things like snow and sleet in zoos in more temperate climates?  

I know they have indoor facilities for a lot of these animals, but I've also seen them out and about in the cold weather, like in this photo.This is a beautiful picture but the zoo it was taken at is absolutely horrible. ""No Dentists permitted in lion enclosure""I live right near the National Zoo, and hear this guy grunting literally every day when I'm home. He's a loud bastard. No roars though.

This is my granddad's ship and, if family lore is to be believed, the ships company acted as honour guard for the cessation of hostilities parade on the Pedang, Singapore, 12 September 1945.Kamikaze is such an ineffective and terrible battle tactic. Planes and pilots are meant to be reusable. If they actually were good at aerial combat they would have used munitions and lived to fight another day. Just imagine how much they could have worn down their opponents just by performing strike after strike rather than just wasting pilots and planes.

For America's sake. I am glad they didn't, but damn. 

Suicide attacks are terrifying. But you don't win a war by blowing yourself up. As Patton said: No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.damn. i would love to see the top of the deck. you could count the sailors by the brown stains.

Airplanes aren't ridiculously heavy, the most iconic i guess WW2 plane for the USA the P51 Mustang weighed in at max load 10,000 lbs, or ~5 tons. 

Average destroyer would be close to 1500 tons, 300:1 ratio.

Blah blah speed force etc, the airplanes aren't designed like a bullet so to speak where the nose is intended to pierce. If a bomb didn't detonate it would be the equivalent of taking a baseball to the chest. Bug splatter.*THUNK*

From what I have heard from interviews on TV with inmates working on wildland firefighting crews and those who have done the work while incarcerated, it seems as though it is so tough yet these men love it and feel so much pride in themselves.  It would be nice if they could transition from prison and have a real chance at working in this field with BLM or something.

The man who wrote this was on the mira monte CDF inmate crew  this was taken about 3-4 weeks ago  right before they timed out  he left that message""Boston George"" Jung?someone did an AMA on here recently that worked as a firefighter while locked up. it was really interesting. As a norwegian, I feel the need to promote our ideas in situations like this. I'm not saying that you could turn ""the Q"" into the types of prisons we have here, but with mental health care, the feeling of acomplishment and having your self worth restored, you can see amazing change in people. [Halden Prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPPZE3IkWJU),[Bastøy Prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj3SMiDvjdg)

Edit; the main reason people are sceptical to this kind of treatment, is(and I understand that this is a concern) that ""bad people"" are treated ""good"", and they deserve to be punished instead of pampered(with taxpayer money). I think the reason most norwegians are on board with the way we do it here is because the prisoners will, at some point(with a near 100% guarantee),  be let back into society, and most people would argue it's best to have your new neighbour be a person who is labled as a carpenter who went to jail, instead of a person who is an inmate who learned carpentry. Instead of looking at it as a money-drain, it is looked at  as an investment in the safety of our society.This kind of overwhelmed me with happiness.  My dad served 5 years in prison.  While, sadly, it's not the norm, my dad came out of prison better than when he went in.  He kept all his promises to me and my mom...and then some.  He quit running with his old friends and lived a straight life.

Trying to get my dad reintegrated to get his voting rights back, etc.  made me realize that people that have served their time DO deserve a second chance at life.

It means a lot to a prisoner to get treated like a man and not an animal.  A little bit of respect goes a long long way.As a firefighter for a fire department myself, I have often wondered how this would fit into our community.

I truly believe that people that are willing to take the training, including physical fitness, training everyday, and become knowledgable in this field, and make a better life for themselves and others as productive members of society should be rewarded.

Unfortunately we have way too many government officials that should be jailed and the keys thrown away.  Our society has become so obsessed thinking that jailing people is the answer.  Its not!!  Providing a way for people to learn to be a productive member of society is.

Those on here ""bashing"" the inmates on here are nothing but keyboard warriors.  Get your fucking fat lazy ass out of your chair and volunteer your time.

I've been a firefighter for over 30 years, both volunteer and paid.  I would be happy to have some of these people helping me as long as they are willing to train.  In my personnel opinion there is no greater job in the worldI ran a contracting business for a couple of decades and hired mainly ex cons because of that philosophy. Treat them like men, and they'll follow you into hell. The closest they ever got was the fresh septic tank that we were told was old and empty. pretty goddam close if you ask me. In 2 decades, I had to fire only a few.My brother is currently in prison and in this program. Thank you for allowing him to see that there is more to life than what he was previously doing. He's gone in a few times and whenever I visit him inside he seems like a different man. I really miss that side of him. Sorry I'm a bit drunk and that just kinda feltike I had to say it. There's not only male inmates that do it. I work at Perryville prison in Arizona as a correctional officer and we just had a crew come back from California that work as a wildfire crew. Ex CO here. I'm not particularly optimistic about inmates rehabilitating them selves, but then the population I worked with were largely ""long-term"" guests of the state with close to max security levels and I'm sure that skews my opinion considerably. However, I might have been considered progressive amongst correction employees in that I believed our best chance of rehabilitating an inmate required that we offer them some education and the opportunity to learn some skills that would come in handy when they walked out the gate. Many, if not most, of my co-workers felt that a GED was sufficient and anything beyond the skills required to perform their institutional work details was a waste of taxpayer $.

So anyway, this is an interesting program and I'm glad it's successful. Any time an inmate has a work detail outside of the institution and he's where he's supposed to be at count time is good for everyone.As a former inmate who has done  outside work leave, it really is rare for this kind of treatment. Thanks to the FDPs working, and the inmates along side them. Good. Prison should focus more on rehabilitation instead of punishment and dehumanization of people. You want them to become productive citizens who contribute to society, no? That's the whole fucking point of jail. People are so stupid. Bad times don't last, but bad guys do ^throws ^toothpickI love this.  A little dignity goes a long ways.Thank you all for being cod. 
I must have misread.CCC? Wildland firefighter checking in...those inmates are seriously some of the hardest workers I've seen.  The guys who serve us breakfast and dinner are real cool people as well. Much respect.  many of them continue to work for contracters as well as working for the state, in Oregon at least, they hire felons I've done fire camp before out of LA county. It's not only an awesome gig(in terms of trustee positions), but you also get 3 for 1 and paid for each hour you work! Can answer any questions people may have. Also got pictures !I've worked with inmate crews quite a bit on large fires (I do logistics). They are by far the most grateful, polite, disciplined and upbeat type 2 crews we get. I've had all 20 of them personally thank me while they go through the chow line. Couldn't be more different from the other crews. I think it's great for inmates to be re-integrated with society but I'm not just skeptical but downright horrified by the ethical problems with using prisoners as labor without proper compensation, though things like firefighting(as dangerous as it is) are way better than the prisoners who simply slave away on assembly lines or in sweat shops.  It's made so much worse by the horrible dichotomy of the situation.  If I had to guess, I'd bet money that prisoner-firefighters who feel properly appreciated for their jobs have a far lower rate of recidivism than those who simply wait out their prison terms behind bars, and that's fantastic.  So many people end up behind bars because they feel worthless and unappreciated, and so many of those in prison are actually smarter than the general population.  The truly dumb ones find a slave-wage job and grind out their existence in it.

An answer to a question that was never askedDoesn't look like one.Larger resolution http://danielkordan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/7.jpg*Ceci n'est pas une peinture.*This might as well be a painting because there is so much work in layer masking done on the image to achieve the dynamic range and saturation.

This was shot under harsh lighting conditions. It's a great photo. But this has a lot of work done to it after it was taken. The direct sunlight at that time of day creates an extreme contrast between shadows and highlights. The shadows on the mountains were made brighter (now they look washed out compared the levels of black tones in the foreground). The sky was darkened to bring some of the blue back into the image but it also made the clouds seem grey.c'est ne pas une pipe

[She's not actually the first female nfl official](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Eastin)ITT: ""She's never played, how can she coach""? Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weiss has never played football; Before that he was the Offensive Coordinator for the New England Patriots and rocks 3 Superbowl rings. Give this woman a chance ffs. So the first female player should debut any day now.

Any day now.well she's an intern, but we'll see.  I played the game for 18 yeas and know a bit about it.  Putting a woman in as a position coach may be a worse idea in my opinion than as a head coach.  A comparison could be made between a head coach to a general contractor as a position coach is to a plumber.  The position coach is there to teach and develop techniques. She's never experienced anything remotely on that level.  A head coach is a strategist.  Chip Kelly is one of a handful of successful head coaches that never played on a competitive professional level. I don't personally know any position coaches who weren't experts at their position.


Edit:  how many of you downvoters have any personal experience with this?I've seen a lot of sexism about this photo (they couldn't have played high school or college football so they clearly must know nothing about the sport and they're only there for PR, not because they earned their jobs).

I can tell you first hand about the ref, Sarah Thomas.

I watched her ref UFL games all the time. The other refs only had good things to say about her. She could keep up with the action as well as anyone. I literally never saw her make a particularly bad call, which is pretty exceptional.

She put in her time between UFL and college games for years. She earned her job.What team is the coach on also what position is she like a coordinator?some how i don't think anyone will care until their playboy spreads are released.What's next?! A lady news anchor?!My wife just demanded Rule 34. I don't know if I should be worried or happy.It figures a progress coach like Bruce would hire her just like Pop did.

Either we arent good at this whole occupation of the middle east for 40+ years there, or our motivations for being there are different than what we have been told.

The article quoted someone who had been present sometime in the 80s (I think) when the city of Detroit awarded Saddam Hussein an honorary key to the city. The guy said something to the effect ""Gee, he was such a nice guy back then. I wonder what happened to change him?"". You want to slap someone like that upside the head and say ""*NOTHING* changed him, you utter moron. He was a nasty human being back then and he's a nasty human being now. It's just that back then the powers in charge decided it was in the U.S. best interests to make him a good guy, and *now* they've decided it's in the U.S. best interest to make him a bad guy."" Must remember to save the clipping from when Syria's future warlords put their armies on the road to peace.You should remember this article and when you are reading the news think to yourself ""is this propaganda?""

This shit just happened overnight.I live in Calistoga, which is where one of the evacuation sights is being held at our fairgrounds. And I just have to say how amazing these communities have been and how incredible it is to see everyone coming together in this time of desperation to donate so much and help in any way they can. They had to actually ask people to stop donating things that weren't tents, and sleeping accessories because they had received so much stuff. It's just nice to know that people do care. There have also been lots of debunked rumors about buildings that were thought to have burned down and are still standing. My positive thoughts are with everyone who has lots their home, pets and personal treasures. Does anyone know how/where to donate items to people that have lost their belongings (clothes, etc) because of these fires? I grew up in/around this town. very devastating, however I am sure it will be rebuilt. My parents still live a few miles from where this photo was taken. They had about 10 minutes to pack up and leave. Fire came across a ridge very quickly and blind sided an entire community.

And the fire is 50,000 acres not 100,000.

That is very sad news. I'm sorry, California. Our thoughts are with you.I woke up this morning in the east bay with my car covered in ashes from this fire, and it is about 100 miles away. The other fire, Butte fire, has displaced my Grandparents and they are staying with me after a forced evacuation. We get fires every year in California but this season hit us overnight, and in populated areas.

Edit: I came to the comments expecting some concern for the 480+ homes in this area destroyed yesterday, and atleast one confirmed fatality. But, I guess jokes about street signs are bigger crowd pleasers.[google street view](https://goo.gl/maps/WSjtm)The worst part in all of this is all the people losing their homes and all their belongings, and the loss of the homes and ecosystems of animals as well. 100k acres is a ton of land.Equally stunning is how edgy and callous people on reddit are about fires burning down towns.[Here is the during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrToRNte8cU) If you'd like to help here are places taking donations and such from the Cal Fire Facebook page: 

CAL FIRE appreciates the support and donations from the residents and local communities in the affected fire areas.  Although this is a great display of community support, the firefighters are self-sufficient and their needs are met.

In 1737, he followed the natural shape of an olive pit to carve a small boat. On the boat are eight figures, each of which is animated and expressive in an individual manner. What is most fascinating is that the entire text of Su Shih's ""Latter Ode on the Red Cliff"", including more than 300 characters and upon which this work is based, is engraved with exquisite detail on the bottom of the boat, testifying to the heavenly craftsmanship of the artist.1 year too early.....> [The ""Carved Olive-stone Boat"", is a tiny boat carved from an olive stone.

I think that might just be the best outdoor environment for any sport ever!Found the perfect place to host controversial games on a neutral field.I'm Brazilian, I live in the US. 

My family lives in an *extremely* remote part of Brazil. 

Their nearest neighbor is about 10 miles away, and the nearest town is probably about 30 miles away. And you can only get to that town by plane. 

So, one day, I was hanging out with my cousins. All of a sudden a group of people walks by (down the dirt road) and asks us if we want to play soccer. 


So my cousin say yes, of course we do. So I set off with my cousins down the road to play soccer.


I figured we would find the first flat piece of land, or  a wide part of the dirt road, and that's where we would play. 

But instead we walked to a perfect manicured soccer field, about a half a mile from my grandmothers house, where they actually even had a sprinkler system built-in using a small windmill. 

The chalked lines were perfectly painted, the nets were new, The whole field was perfectly maintained. 

I later learned that every neighbor in the area took turns maintaining the field. 

THAT is when I learned that Brazilians are serious about soccer. Okay, 2026 world cup need to be in Norway. Imagine how awesome see a football world cup level in this camp with this view.

There is no space for public, but it is a irrelevant detailIsn't there a golf course near there as well, Lofoten Links?

I imagine you trekking the globe with your laptop going from destination to destination and holding your laptop up to the mountainscape and each time disappointedly shaking your head, shrugging you shoulders, and saying on to the next one. Until one fine day...

When i was a kid,  living in Madrid , my dad bought a painting in a street market. The painting shows an old bridge with a strange cross, over a small river . We didn't knew at the time, but that cross was actually one of the symbols of Astúrias, a province in the north of spain. 3 or 4 years after that, my dad got a job offer in Astúrias, and we ended up moving there.  Like most people living in a new place,  we wanted to see all the interesting and beautiful touristic spots there were around, and in one of the places we visited we saw that exact bridge.  

To my dad, this was a sign that we were destined to move to Astúrias, and, after ~8 years, the painting is still hanging on my living room

Edit: 9 posts since!Let me share two older blarog pumpkins which are really great, too:

[Just the Balrog](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/66/c2/8266c2f733c4d47d7f575063b2fe99d4.jpg)

http://i.imgur.com/8zcxxaw.jpg""The Gourd Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udun. Go back to the shadow!""""I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Go back to the shadow! **You. Shall. Not. Pass!**""


Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. By identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame impersishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maiar, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar  has set to burn at the center of Arda (Earth).

Wielder of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire Narya but maybe also through his own divine origins.

Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maiar in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (go back to the shadows) or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Valar Mandos the fate of all slain creatures.Is /u/CANT_TRUST_HILLARY a new alt of /u/gallowboob?Shadow and flame. How the fuck does cant trust hilary have so many successful postsHoly fucking wow. Epic work!

Kinda looks like diablo as well. I tried to carve a triforce and it collapsed into just a triangle. ""Carve, you fools""Most impressive.Yea... I could not draw that on paper, so... have my upvote.

Seriously well done.Goddammit when I see people this talented it makes me think ""why do I even bother?""Oh! I love StarTrek!You post so much content I feel like you should be on the Reddit payroll Hmm I can't tell if the balrog has wings or not. I always felt that the ""You cannot pass"" line from the book felt more powerful than the ""You shall not pass"" from the movie. 

'Cannot' just feels like more of an absolute. That there is no way the Balrog will make it past while Gandalf is breathing. 'Shall not' feels more like a request that the Balrog not try to get past him.

This was taken in Etosha National Park, Namibia [edit: detailed location removed, see comments below]. I waited at a waterhole for 7 hours from noon to 7pm. There was very little wildlife activity during the afteroon, and only a few springboks showed up to drink. At around 6pm the sky was still overcast and I almost decided to leave, but eventually decided to stay until the end of the day. The real show started around 6:30pm as the sun finally pierced through the clouds... and this wonderful rhino came to drink and bathe, just as the sun was disappearing below the horizon.

I went back the following day and was lucky enough to see four rhinos this time, with one male courting two females successively. Lots of grunting and horn-touching, and the male disappeared in the bush with one female later on.

I travelled in Africa for 6 months from South Africa to Ethiopia and this is without question one of the most memorable moments of my trip. Etosha was really incredible, as were Kruger and Kalahari in South Africa. Seeing the wildlife from up close is such an intense experience. Go if you ever get the chance!

Finally I have a [photography website](http://www.johangeorget.com) for those who wish to see pictures of this trip. I hope no one will mind me that I share the links here.

I was in Seattle for business last summer. The first 4 days I was there, the weather was what you think of as typical for Seattle: grey and cloudy.

On the morning of my 5th day there, the clouds cleared out and it became sunny, so I went for a walk around the building I was working in, as I had done every day. 

I turned the corner of this building and I was totally taken by surprise by Mt. Rainier just appearing on the horizon. I'd looked in that direction the last 4 days and seen nothing, so I was so shocked by the size of it. It looked totally fake, towering over the landscape by itself, and I just stood there, staring at it for about the next 5 minutes. It was one of the most beautiful and awe inducing things I ever seen.

Because Seattle.[A couple photos I took](http://imgur.com/IMd60N4&1TdqPgk) leaving Seattle on January 25, 2015.Fuck, that's what I imagine Mount Olympus should look like.I feel sooo small I now want to go to Seattle.It looks like it's floating!Wow it's only 14,000 feet? That insane. I definitely cannot fathom how tall Everest is or even other mountains. I need to see a big mountain.[Banana for scale](http://i.imgur.com/gMzCcuR.jpg). Also as a seattlite there are some camera shenanigans going on to make the mountain look so huge. [deleted]Looks like it might be an attempt at a modern day extinction event.I see Mr. Ross went all out with the Prussian Blue, there!""I will kill all of you one day, just wait....""Moved to Seattle while the clouds were still blocking the view of Mt Ranier. The clouds can block it from view for weeks at a time.  Friends kept saying that Ranier hasn't come out yet. My response was ""how will I know when I see it?""
""Oh, you'll know."" You don't realize how huge the thing is until you see it for yourself!
so if Mt. Ranier is 60 miles away from Seattle, and a pyroclastic flow travels at 500 mph, and Bob, who is having lunch at Pike Place  stares at the beautiful exploding mountain for 30 seconds before running to his car which just happens to be right outside, how far can Bob get before he's suffocated by searing gas and choking ash as he watches the city disappear? Extra credit for what kin of car he's driving. Brilliant photo!

If anyone is wondering, you get this type of effect by using a zoom lens (like 200 or 300mm) and zooming in, which makes images in the distance appear much bigger. Photos like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/rEIhvQt.jpg) are also created with this method.

[Edit: Link to story](http://abc13.com/society/german-indoor-park-could-be-vision-for-future-astrodome/689177/)Would the place be large enough to have its own weather? I didn't see any mention of it in the Wikipedia article. I was thinking about the Wikipedia article that says weather forms in the [Vehicle Assembly Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building) that's used by NASA.

edit: Added 'have' to the first sentence.There's not much water for a water park.This picture instantly reminded me of [this](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m72mmkBr4z1qz7ejco1_1280.jpg)Houston [recently sent leaders to this park](http://www.khou.com/story/news/features/2015/05/05/county-leaders-to-return-from-germany-begin-work-on-astrodomes-future/26955091/) to explore this idea for revamping the Astrodome. 

The [Astrodome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome) is the first domed stadium, and has been sitting unused for about a decade. 

I personally think this is a great idea. Houston is a huge metro area (4th most populous in the country) but lacks a world-class amusement or water park since Six Flags closed. And the summers here can be unbearable, so going indoors is a great idea. Now who's paying for it? That'll be an issue of course.This is not an *old* airship hangar. The building was finished in November 2001. It belonged to a company called CargoLifter that wanted to build freight airships but went bankrupt before any airship was built. They basically only built the hangar and a few hot air balloons for testing.  
  
After that the hangar was re purposed as this waterpark.  
  
Edit: *Old* airship hangars looked like [this](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftschiffhalle#/media/File:Luftschiffhalle-Biesdorf.jpg) (1911)  
  
Edit 2: changed emphasize from 'not' to 'old' to prevent further confusionThe snack bar serves Hindenburgers.I wonder how many sunbenches are reserved with towels.[What, you've never seen this video?](https://vimeo.com/61845373)Is this the place from that Deichkind video?


[Edit: Looks like it](https://vimeo.com/61845373)This hangar was actually built in 1998, and has nothing to do with the nazis or hindenburg. it was built for an airship project called Cargolifter, which would have been used to transport extremely heavy things into and out of berlin. Before they built the zeppelin they noticed that this could not work, because as soon as the cargo would have been released, the airships high bouyancy ( to lift the several-ton Cargo) would have catapulted the ship up. But the hangar was built anyway. I cannot recommend the park in it, its horrible because there is no sky, and very non-tropical lightingThat middle part could be turned into lazy river. Not really old. It was built in 2000.

You can (and people do) climb all over the stones. 

I spent the night at Stonehenge for summer solstice 7 years ago. There were some Druid rituals - I remember a parade with flaming torches and giant furry animal heads - but mostly people were just there to party. There were drum circles everywhere, some food vendors, and lots of drinking and smoking. 

Unfortunately, it drizzled the whole time, so we didn't get to see the sunrise through the stones. But I was glad the weather forced me to wear wellies, because man, those porta potties grew increasingly biohazardous as the night wore on. Edit to change my opinion. Apparently they trash it every year and it's kinda sad. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11455098/Stonehenge-damaged-with-chewing-gum-and-graffiti-during-Winter-Solstice.htmlMy dad said that when he was a kid in the 60's, stonehenge was just this random thing off the highway, with one tiny little sign, and you just parked on the highway shoulder and walked over to it.  You could climb on it, there was some small graffiti on it, and nobody cared, because there was nobody there.

We went again as a family in 2006, and you had to park in a parking lot far away, pay an entry fee, walk through this long underground tunnel that took you underneath the highway with a bunch of infographics on the walls, then you come to stonehenge and it's all roped off with velvet and you just slowly walk around it in a circle with the group, stopping occasionally to take pictures.They left that place in ruins.This is why we can't have nice things.

What a bunch of fucking arseholes.Funny, they didn't look Druish.As a janitor, I'm impressed. After that many people this looks pretty tame. Is no one in this thread able to realise that most of the 23,000 aren't hippies and are just party-goers?also, plenty of other people. I mean, if you've got 23,000 people, some subset of them are gonna be assholes no matter what.

You could probably make this title 23,000 gamers, white people and self-stylied atheists and be equally as accurate.*Shocking* that a group of 23k people left trash on the ground. 20k out of the 23k could have cleaned up all their mess and you're still left with the mess of 3k people. >Claims to celebrate and respect the earth

>Leaves a bunch of paper/petrol-based garbage at an ancient Druid heritage site.http://i.imgur.com/tNx7nB4.gifI went to Stonehenge a few years ago and they had a rope fence up about a hundred feet from the stones because people vandalized the stones. 
then people do shit like this, nothing pisses me off more than seeing a place people hold sacred trashed by 23k of the absolute scum of society. I think most of them aren't really hippies or druids, just people who like a party.Gotta love that Hipster hypocrisy ;) ""But man, we love mother earth! She is so beautiful, lets throw our trash all over it.""

You've missed the photo where loads of people stayed behind to clear up. This is disgusting.If anyone's ever been they'll know it's mainly populated by local chavs looking for an excuse to get wrecked. Not trying to defend their actions here but I bet if you put a group of 23000 of anybody it would look the same.I was there for the whole event and I can tell you there were people from all social circles. There were plenty of new-agers and hippies but they were heavily outnumbered by the general public.

The event is part of a religious holiday that's open to anyone and although there were volunteers picking litter, you have to expect some debris from 23,000 people moving in and around the stones.

Otherwise it was an absolutely electric night, people chanting, playing bongos and dancing around the circle into the early hours was amazing to see. I even saw a guy playing a saxophone to one of the stones.I was there

I am there every year

Loads of local chavs and non hippies turn up to get fucked up and ruin the vibe. Don't blame the hippies because we make up less than half of the people there - after the sunrise all the non-hippies leave and then you'll see what the summer solstice celebrators are really like!I was there at the 2015 summer Solstice, I was there with my friends just to see what all the hype was about. And as far as I could tell the people doing all the damage was not the druids and people there for the religous ceremony but the people who  were there to get smashed and take drugs in a field. It was basically like Reading Festival Campsite, and if anyone has ever seen a festival campsite after the festival has finished it looks exactly like this.Japanese druids would never let this happen.

I agree OP.Skyrim mods sure are beautiful.Looks like someone's casting magic missile The real breathtaking thing is when you see a meteor/shooting star so close by that you can hear it breaking up.

This happened to me in Fargo a few years ago. It was casting shadows in my yard, then a few seconds later I heard a warble and some crunching noises. I couldn't believe it.HhhhhEEEHHhhhh GIVE IT BACK I CAN'T BREFThis is insane (to me) that this is on the front page. I saw something very similar as I was walking to the bar ~2 hours ago. I thought it was a shooting star at first, the it got HUGE and blue. Then there was a white burst of light, a second burst of light, and then it disappeared. It all happened so fast.Throw a wolf on that pic and you've got a best selling tshirt at Walmart!We were driving home from Edmonton to Calgary and saw this streak by. It was amazing to see.

-first eruption in 42 years (1972)
-1500 people evacuated from nearby Ensenada
-it is considered a ""sparsely populated area""
-it is not the only volcano currently spewing hell vomit in Chile at the moment

Best of luck to those nearby!
A few questions,

-What are people supposed to do when you live this close to an active volcano? 

-Does the media play a positive or negative part when something like this happens?

-Can lava melt steel beams?Anyone want a quick volcanology lesson? Heres how this type of eruption works. Inside the mountain is a magma chamber, filled with liquid magma under pressure. In this magma are gasses dissolved inside it. Think of it like a bottle of soda, when you look at the liquid, it's just liquid; but when you release the pressure, the gasses come out and bubble up out the liquid. Same principle in this type of volcano. When the pressure gets too high in the chamber an eruption begins and the gasses in the magma are released out of the magma just like in the soda bottle. But the gasses also bring with it some magma that is quickly solidified into particles as the gas escapes, this is the volcanic ash. So the huge cloud you see is a combination of volcanic gasses and particulate magma known as ash, and at very high temperatures non the less. As the pressure in the magma chamber comes down the eruption slows down, and when the pressure has been relieved the eruption ends. Not a volcanologist, so this info is my synthesis of a complicated process from when I wanted to learn how this worked one day, and is a very basic explanation. [here is a time lapse Video of the erupting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljrDn3Gel4M)[deleted]Calbuco is the name of the volcano.

Shouldn't you be running, rather than taking (amazing) pics of this?Can you imagine living in the ancient world and seeing something like this? Dang.Flip that photo upside down, and that's what my ass would be doing if I was there.It's annoyed me for a long time how no-one ever seems to take high-res pictures of volcanic eruptions. I just want a desktop background, is that too much to ask?I made a 3D Web Scene of the volcano with data before this eruption.

Americans tend to romanticize revolution due to our own history, which turned out OK.  But I think in many cases a revolution just replaces the current bad players with a possible set of worse players.

I was crying and being a typical whiny 4 year old (I was also malnourished and dirty) and this one cop kept me company in the house while everyone else was outside discussing things. He read me a book and played with my stuffed animals with me, and we had a lot of fun. After I was removed from the home, he showed up at my court appearances for almost a year. Officer Clarke was a great guy. Cops like him, and this guy really set the standard for what it means to be a public servant. My father was a paramedic in the city for 30 years..he has never cut a dead body out of a seat belt.
Edit: thanks for the gold! To clarify, Every time my father has had to cut a seat belt, the person was alive. Seat belts save lives, so do helmets. I always wear my seat belt, even if I'm driving around the block, not because I don't trust my own driving,..but I don't trust anyone else.This is heartbreaking.  One of my biggest somewhat irrational fears is that they won't be able to find someone to quickly take care of my kids if something unexpectedly happens to me.  I imagine they'd be so confused and scared.  I hope they found this little girl's relatives quickly.This brings back so many memories from when I was 7- years-old. All 8 members of my family were on a road trip in a 7 passenger van all of us were wearing seatbelts except my 4-year-old brother, Jake, who was sitting in my 12-year-old sister's lap, Cara. It was morning and I was asleep in the front seat while my dad was driving. Next thing I know I wake up hanging in the air because the van had rolled and finally settled on the driver's side.

Everyone was out of the car already and my dad helped me climb out through the back of the van. As soon as I step out I see my oldest sister(17),Lynn, covered in blood and my 10-year-old sister, Jess screaming for someone to help Lynn. Someone guided me and Jess away from the accident and set us on a blanket facing an empty field. We moved to a truck when it started raining before riding in an ambulance with my mom and Jake on a stretcher.

The 5 of us who were wearing our seat belts properly walked away hardly any scratches. Lynn wasn't wearing her shoulder belt and went half way out the window and broke her clavicle and got around 40 staples in her leg and some stitches. She stayed in the hospital a few days and made a full recovery. 

Jake and Cara were the only ones not wearing seatbelts at all. They were ejected from the car together and Cara acted as a cushion for Jake and very likely saved his life. He needed some stitches but was fine otherwise. Cara died within minutes.

After the fact I learned that Cara had been wearing her seatbelt just minutes before the accident. Lynn had asked Cara to get something from the back and she and Jake were both leaning over the backseat at the time of the accident.

Don't even take your seatbelt off for a second.[deleted]""Police say the two adults and four kids in the SUV were not properly restrained. All of them were ejected in the crash.""

OK. This is terrible but if you can't use your fucking seat belts to protect your family...People please wear your damn seat belt!! I just pulled a guy out of his over turned Ford Taurus in front of my house that had flipped 4 times Monday of this week who survived because he was wearing his seat belt. If he hadnt been im almost positive he wouldve been dead easily. It is in the car for a reason!Some years back I rear ended another driver. Slammed into the back of their car at about 50mph. We all walked away okay. My airbag and seatbelt kept me okay. I ended up with a small burn on my arm from the airbag. Apparently even the officer told me it was a high accident area.

Now recently I was getting ready to head to Disneyland with my inlaws and infant son. We're getting ready to get into the car and I noticed the number of people(5 adults and an infant) and their car is a five seater. I asked if we we're taking two cars and they said the baby was going to ride on somebody's lap. I was a wee bit pissed and put my foot down. My son rode in his car seat and we crammed three adults in the back seat. If they want to risk their safety that's fine. But like Hell I was going to let them risk my son's.[deleted]It's 2015. How in the actual hell are people still not using seatbelts? I don't even realize that I'm putting it on - it's just a reflex as is putting the keys in the ignition. You really have to make a conscious decision to not put your seatbelt on. I don't feel like it's something that you just forget to do. If I'm not buckled in, I feel that everything is horribly wrong.Here's a story I don't like telling much, but maybe it will convince somebody.

When I was 18 or 19, I lived overseas near an American air base in Germany and worked on base.  Every morning, I would leave for work later than I should have, and speed the whole way through these little villages and country roads.  If you've ever driven in Pennsylvania or other states in the area, kinda like that.

Near the base, there was a big blind corner that was pretty fun to go fast on, hugging the inside.  I did this hundreds of times, usually bleary-eyed and tired in the morning from staying up too late on AOL talking to this girl.  No big deal, the road was wide enough and there was rarely any traffic in the morning.

Then, one particular morning, I went around that curve and saw a woman in the street waving her arms.  I slowed down, and as I was doing so, I saw the car on its roof off to the left, and a body in the road about fifty yards ahead.  I pulled over, put my blinkers on, got out the warning triangle and first aid kit and ran over to the arm waver. I was the second person on the scene.

The obvious conversation happened, and I called whatever the 911 equivalent was over there, spoke broken English to some German guy, and then went to see what I could do about the woman in the street.

Her car was on its roof, and it was still running.  Something was playing on the radio and the exhaust pipe was emitting exhaust.  It was cold enough that you could see the exhaust. I turned the car off, and went back to the woman.  I have no useful medical training beyond some very basic first aid and a lapsed CPR certification, so all I could do was talk to her and put my coat and some emergency blankets on her.  She obviously had a head wound and was in and out of almost-consciousness. It had been drizzling, so the road was damp.  Her head was bleeding.  I can still see the water on the road mixed with her blood, and the dirt and rocks pressed in to the skin of her face, where her sweater was ripped on her shoulder, and the scratches on her skin.

Time passes.  No emergency services.  By this time I'd stopped traffic and spoken to the arm-waver about what had happened.  She'd seen it.  The victim went around the corner at the same time as a big truck coming the other way.  The truck was over the line a bit, and she over-corrected, flipped, and was ejected.

Called 911 again.  Same kind of conversation.  A little bit of time passes.  Finally this guy runs up with a baby in his arms.  He's her husband and got stuck in the traffic jam caused by his wife's accident.  He walked up to see what was going on and found out.  There's nothing he can do either.  Some emergency services from the base finally show up after somebody else had called, and they start doing their thing.  Those of us who are close enough to the scene are told to drive away and leave so that a helicopter can land soon.  I take my coat back, drive to work, and wash the blood off of my hands and my phone, and hide in the back for a little while so I can compose myself.

I had nightmares for about a month after that.  Not because of what I had seen really, but because if I had been maybe five or ten minutes earlier, if I was the first one on the scene and hadn't been stopped by the arm-waver, I probably wouldn't have been able to stop in time.  With wet roads like that, I probably would have driven over the victim in the road as I realized what was happening.  You can imagine what my dreams were about.

So, pay attention, and wear your goddamn seatbelts.
My friend, In a church group, got in a car accident in a head on collision going 55. Every person, except her, wasn't wearing their seat belt. Her mother, father, and 5 others were ejected from the vehicle. 3 people including her mother died, her father was a paraplegic and everyone else had severe injuries. She had a broken arm and some bruising. Seat belts save your your fucking life. This man can prove it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stapp""... Look for the helpers. You will always find people that are helping.""  - Mr. RogersNo matter how bad my day at the office is, I'm fucking glad I don't have to do this shit.This is one of the most heartbreaking photos I've ever seen.Wow. The most heroic thing I did today was smile at a dog.My wife responds that these kinds of calls about twice a week. Lately she has had her car spit on because of the immediate assumption that all cops are evil and want to shoot everyone. 

Yet she does stuff like you see in the photo for a living. Last week she went to two separate child deaths from crashes. Slightly different scenario but I want to give a shout out to one Officer Barcus, who helped distract me, a 28 year old graduate student, after I walked in and found my father had shot himself in the head at his house. As I was the only legal next of kin there (my mom was there but she was divorced from my dad) I had to wait for the Coroner to sign paperwork. On the worst day of my life, this cop talked to me, asked me about what I was studying, and basically kept me from just completely freaking out. This was 20 years ago. It's often the smallest things that make the biggest difference. Fuck this hits home. Medic here. I've had some truly heart wrenching calls. One of which was a father who had taken his young daughter quadding with him. Rolled his quad and broke his neck.  His daughter sat with him for close to three days if I remember correctly. She was 5 or 6. Kept telling us to be quiet because daddy was sleeping. 

I've never cried on call before, but how do you explain to a child that young that daddy isn't sleeping. Daddy is dead. 

I went home and hugged my sister that night.This isn't cop stuff, this isn't man stuff or dad stuff... This is fucking real people stuff. Real human shit.Sauce -
http://www.9news.com/story/news/traffic/2015/06/18/i-76-closed-due-to-crash/28926321/For all the horrific stories about cops killing people, I worked for many years as a civilian crisis worker for LEOs.  People often don't understand how police are exposed to horrific circumstances and emotions that are 'just part of the job.'  For all the WTF and watchpeopledie subreddits here, police often see this stuff first hand.  Crime and accident scenes attack all the senses-- decaying bodies are one thing, but even the smell of blood and gore indoors is something that cannot be described.  It is much more intense than just seeing a photo on reddit.

I dealt with three cases that still haunt me.

1-  A cop responded to a dead baby in a home.  A mother just had taken her newborn home, was exhausted, fell asleep, rolled over, and smothered her baby.  Later, after that situation was handled, the same cop was called out to the interstate where there was a report of a dead deer in the road.  The same mother had jumped from an overpass at night, and was basically just a stain on the asphalt.  That cop had a very bad shift.

2-  A dead baby at a day care.... I'll skip the details here, but going through a debrief with a bunch of weeping police officers was very intense.  

These stories never made the news.

The third story happened more than 10 years ago, and it is still being litigated, and has been in the national media.  I will skip the details other than to say it involved a horrific mutilation in a public bathroom.... and a hysterical, surviving mother.  Everyone attached to the case was deeply affected for years.  I had a first responder reach out to me this week---- years later, to discuss the case.

I have a close friend who was a homicide detective.  It sucks driving around town with her, since everywhere she goes she points out, we had a murder there, a shooting there, a suicide there, etc.

It seriously does something to people, and they tend to become desensitized to many things as a coping mechanism.  It taints their world view to be exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer, and they deal with life and death (mostly unnecessary death) on a regular basis.  I am not a police apologist, as I find it horrible how police in the US have become militarized.  But there is a reason some cops treat everyone like animals.

What I find sad is that many police don't have what it takes to work effectively with the general public.  They may have had it at one point, but it can disappear.  The profession should do a better job at psych screening.  It isn't that different than the PTSD people/soldiers get in war zones.  Even the 'Barney Fifes' working in rural areas are seeing brutal killings of 80 year old women in meth related cases, or horrific issues of child neglect.Thanks for helping show the good cops, OP.I could never be a police officer.

Imagine that kind of shit just being part of your fucking day. Once they were done at that crash site, that officer holding the child had to go do fucking paperwork.

How could you possibly get on with your day after distracting a newly-orphaned little boy/girl from the sight of their dead parents a handful of metres away?

The problem is, if it happens enough times, the alligator will get used to receiving food from people. And then they start to see people and think ""food!"" And then they start to approach people. And then they think, this person is holding out on me, being all coy backing away instead of giving me my chicken nuggets! And then they follow the person, who perceives it as aggression.

You can't relocate an alligator; they've fought other gators for the right to whatever territory they live in and they *will come back.* They will come back.

It *ruins* an alligator when they begin to feel comfortable associating with humans. I don't know of a single state that actually ""removes"" alligators--relocation doesn't work. Nine times out of ten, any pest control or park service you call will end up euthanizing any gator they've received a complaint about.

Here's a series of articles about a 50 year old gator who caused some ruckus in my town last June:

* First, someone saw him and complained. So he was removed.
* [Then he came back](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/03/3143848/whopper-gator-found-hilton-head.html) to his original location
* Someone complained that he was relocated rather than killed, so [an investigation started](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/04/3146663/large-alligators-release-to-be.html)
* A resident said that the gator [wasn't aggressive](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/06/07/3151999/hilton-head-islander-speaks-up.html)
* But the pest control guy lost his contract with the city anyway and the 50 year old, 1000 pound gator was killed.
* Some people [didnt think the guy shouldve lost his job](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/09/3203948/petition-supporting-gator-wrangler.html)
* That's when things got really interesting. Another alligator was hit by a car on one of our busy highways in town. The city, having just terminated their contract with the-guy-who-handles-this-sort-of-thing, didnt have anyone to go and pick it up. So, over the next few hours and in the ensuing traffic jam, all of our tourists and residents were treated to a delightful viewing of this alligators slow death in the median. [Article](http://www.islandpacket.com/2014/07/03/3195631/maffo-critter-management-lose.html)


So, here are some tips for next time you see an alligator during your vacation:

* Respect them. Take photos from a respectable distance.
* Do not approach or harass them. They are not in a glass tank and they are not here to entertain you--you do not need to interact with them.
* Do not pick up, approach or harass their babies. Alligator moms actually do stick around their young and nurture them.
* Take care to look after your own young children and pets, as those are the most likely things an alligator will mistakenly see as food.
* Please don't call animal control just because you *see* a gator. Only call animal control if the animal is behaving in an aggressive way, or approaching humans. Gators who are minding their own business don't deserve to be euthanized just for existing.
* For the love of god, do not attempt to feed them chicken nuggets.So what's the legal standpoint of shooting one that's in your yard?[Alligators are some scary shit.](http://i.imgur.com/wY5BZ.gif)

Sea lions have canine teeth, just like a dog. It dragged me headfirst into the water. Id actually seen it out of the corner of my eye a split second before I felt the pain. It was big and had such strength. It pulled me straight down to the bottom of the bay, about 25-30ft. I was moving incredibly fast through the water. It whipped me back and forth five or six times. I thought, Well, now you know how you are going to die.

Stay the fuck away from the sea lions if you come here or anywhere else that has sea lions! They will not mess with you as long as you respect them.

I watched a Japanese tourist get completely f'd up at la jolla cove a couple years back, dumb ass was reaching her hand out to pet it.

Cherry blossoms guide your way,

It's snowing on Mount Fuji. http://i.minus.com/iblgBgXYNzj0gs.gifhow come the pictures look so soft?Dumbass coming through. What's with all the ""it's snowing on Mt. Fuji"" comments?I read this as ""Japan in full boom""
I expected something else[Source](https://500px.com/photo/105244145/fuji!-by-daniel-kordan) and /r/japanpics if you want to take a look.For anyone feeling inspired to go to Japan, I've gone twice so let me make it concrete for ya.

**Flights:** Flights can be, at best, around 600 USD round trip. United ran a special for this cost. Often you'll find a round trip for about 1200 USD (this is my experience flying from SFO in the bay area). Use [itasoftware](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) to search for flights. Also google around for deals.

Alternatively, look into acquiring mileage points through credit card usage and flying for free. 

**Room:** On my second visit I stayed in a hostel called [Khaosan Kabuki](http://www.khaosan-tokyo.com/en/kabuki/) for about 35 a night. You can get free room if you volunteer to clean. 

Many hostels are similarly priced / have similar volunteer benefits. 

Let me clarify that a ""hostel"" is not as shady as it connotes. The place I stayed was as clean as any hotel I've been to.

Capsule Hotels are also cheap and somewhat of an experience. 

**Food:** Food in Japan is like food anywhere. There's cheap stuff (less than 10) decent stuff (10-25) and expensive (30-100's). 

You can have a very enjoyable trip eating for less than 10 a meal although I suggest splurging once or twice because Japan does have amazing food to offer. The best value / quality for sushi I've heard of and had myself is a place called [Midori](http://www.sushinomidori.co.jp/index.html).

There's no tipping either which is amazing as I'm from the U.S. and any $10 meal was actually $10.

**Sights / Activities:** This is far more flexible depending on the kind of person you are. I spent most of my time walking around which is free.  I recommend at least 1 planned activity that's unique to Japan and new to you (Karaoke, Onsen, traditional breakfast, etc). 

**Language Barrier:** Japanese people are some of the most courteous and kind people in the world. Culture reasons. One of the things that stands out on my first trip was a mob of people *standing on the right side of an escalator and letting walkers through on the left. No one broke this rule.* 

English is pretty prevalent in Japan, especially the cities. In fact there's a Starbucks in the Shibuya Crossing which is a hugely popular spot and a KFC nearby. Western influence abounds.

People are mostly happy to try and communicate with you. But yes, it's scary to engage with someone who doesn't speak your language. 

**Story Time:** I was with my friend Matt (who had actually just finished traveling east from Florida... long way around the world). We had a ""sushi day"" where we decided to get expensive sushi lunch and dinner in the same day.

For lunch, we visited [Kyubei](http://www.kyubey.jp/). Our reservation was made by our Hostel staff (which is something they are always willing to help with). I'm assuming they acknowledged we were English speaking and we were sat with a chef who spoke enough English. 

For dinner, we visited the [highest-rated sushi place on Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066854-d1692134-Reviews-Sushiryori_Inose-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html). After an awesome sushi course, we were sitting alone in their shop. It was cold outside. The sushi chef spoke ""O-sake?"" offering us some sake. 

Well, we ended up sitting with them for almost two more hours drinking sake and bumbling our way through communication. I learned their son is a model in magazines. They pulled out a giant map of the world and my friend Matt showed them where he had been. They like California Cabernet wine. The wife played some Michael Jackson on her phone and did an impersonation. 

Points here are that people want to connect with you and Japan is pretty accepting of English.

We even had a bus driver yelling at us on a bus full of Japanese passengers. Turns out we missed our stop (I had mentioned it to him before getting on). He literally stopped the bus, motioned for us to get out, and pointed us in the right direction. It was embarrassing and stressful unlike the previous sushi dinners. Point here is that there will be moments where it's not roses.

---

All in all you could do Japan on 2k easily. If you pull a flight deal or a free flight through miles it'll be even cheaper.Ok, I will be that guy.

WTF is going on with the ladder. 

It looks like somebody was fixing the roof and just said. ""Fuck it, I will just leave this here.""Where was this taken?  gTA needs a game set in Japan.I miss japan.

Dave Grohl fell off the stage during their second song (Monkey Wrench), due to what I assume was a random misstep. Still in possession of the mic, Dave announced that he had just broken his leg. Medics arrived shortly and carried him off the stage. The rest of the band followed him backstage but soon returned to play a few songs without him. After those few songs, MEDICS CARRY DAVE BACK ONTO THE STAGE AND PLACE HIM IN A CHAIR. They continued to play for 2 hours after that, only taking a 5 minute break for Dave to have his leg put in a cast. Apparently they wanted to take him to the hospital but he refused, insisting to ""keep playing until the doctor dragged him off the stage.""  It was absolutely amazing, what a badass.

The gig just ended, I was there! He didn't actually fall off the stage, he jumped off! 


I was heartbroken when this happened as I had been waiting for years to see them and only one song in, he breaks his leg. But to see him come back out again was **fucking incredible**. This was an amazing gig and, though he was static in his chair, he rocked out like hell.


Edit: Thought it'd be worth mentioning That Dave shed a few tears when thanking the audience for staying throughout the gig, before playing a softer version of Big Me. 

He also dedicated ""My Hero"" to one of the members of the medical staff who helped him make sure his leg was fine during the gig.

Huge respect for this man! Here are some more pictures and he actually broke his leg, not just the foot!!!

I saw the Foo Fighters in Charlotte NC a few years back, and it was an absolutely massive show. They had Social Distortion and another band open, and still played for 3+ hours themselves. After they came out and played a string of crowd warmer songs, Grohl's like, ""hope you guys aren't doing anything tomorrow cause we'll rocking all night!"" As he pans the crowd, he sees me point to my invisible wristwatch and shug, like it's already too late and I've got respectable adult shit to do in the morning. He points me out and yells, ""fuck you, I've got you tonight."" I swooned all in my undies that night.Here is my own video of Dave returning to the stage. The first time.

Super awesome dude! What happened : In the middle of the second song during a solo he went to the edge of the stage,took a step too many and tipped over.  The band kept playing for about a minute until they realized he was badly injured. 

Dave announced that he was calling off the show because he had to go to the hospital.  People started leaving and the band decided to play a few songs without Dave.  10 minutes later Dave gets carried back onto the stage to do just 1 song before heading off to the hospital , changes his mind and ends up performing the most magical concert I've ever been to.

Does this trail go close enough to towns/cities etc to restock regularly or do you carry weeks worth of food and like drink from rivers or...? 

Sorry if I sound retarded but I've always wondered how this sort of thing works.How long did it take him? I want to know how many pairs of walking shoes he went through. I've always wanted to try this but with a walking buddy.I did 1,100 miles on the PCT during a 2013 thru-hike attempt (Campo to South Lake Tahoe; Campo to Manning Park, or Mexico to Canada, is about 2,650 mile. The author of Wild, IIRC, hiked about 1,100 miles as well, but she was farther north, ending at the Washington/Oregon line). [Here's my before/after](https://instagram.com/p/07-x-2iEuK/?taken-by=npersac). I did the same thing in 2012!  I also didn't shave the entire hike (from mid April to early September) and took a photo at the southern monument, shortly after finishing, and again just after shaving the beard.  I lost about 30 lbs over the entire trip.

(1min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ioaaRa6UM)Can anyone explain how you would weld like this. I have some TIG experience but this just blows my mind.I have no idea what's going on in this thread.I used to work for a place that made turbofan vanes for General Electric and Pratt Whitney. We once tried to get a Rolls Royce contract and spent over a year fabricating one ring of vanes for them. They reject it over and over until we had to withdraw. They are very particular.Ahh yes a classic rolls-royce cobra style weld. While we all know how much the great welders of our time make, it is amazing what a little patience and knowledge of walking the cup can produce.  Judging by the picture, and the lack of scratches, it appears the master artisan must have tig fingered his way to success.  How else could one explain the beauty of this elongated infinity weaving style wield? Bartelby fartle clomp, I have no idea what is going on here.Dad works for rolls royce aerospace. He loves spouting off about them, and some stuff is really interesting. There are multiple rungs of blades inside a rolls royce combustion engine. As someone previously mentioned the whole engine is tested and designed to contain the damage if one of these blades shears off and gets mangled through the engine. He also brought home a small (5inch?) blade once that is normally worth about £10K, but because it had a defect that no human eye could detect it was nearly worthless. He also told me these blades are grown, not machined, because the metal's crystal lattice can sometimes have defects or impurities in the structure. They literally grow liquid metal crystal blades because they have a purer, stronger structure. Amazing.

*-edit: The amount of people trying to claim they know what they're talking about in this thread is astounding. No, metallic crystal growing is not ""letting molten metal cool"" or any other spurious shit i've read. As a student of forensic chemistry even i don't consider myself an authority on it but we covered it briefly in electrochemistry. It's basically bringing the metal ions out of solution very slowly so it forms a uniform crystal structure. Here's a basic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnyBldC4Ra4) of the process, obviously the techniques they use are more refined than this so they grow less complex structures. But the fundamentals are there.*

**-edit: I'm gonna stay true to reddiquette and formally recant my last edit as opposed to just deleting it. I was informed, during our electrochemical stint, by a phD professor that this is how they grow crystalline metallic single crystal lattices for rolls royce blades. But as i aforementioned, i'm no authority on it**[This is what my welds look similar too](http://www.motorgeek.com/phpBB2/gallery2/d/79519-2/crap6.JPG) No wonder i cant get a job at Rolls Royce...

It takes a lot of thought and effort to personalize a cake so completely. Or maybe it's for themselves. Either way, this kid thinks big. This isn't just a child's doodle.

friend who grew up with an abusive father and told me at work one night how the simple phrase ""Michael, get me a pencil please"" triggers his anxiety. His mother would ask him this as a signal for him to call 911 whenever his dad was about to beat her. Gives me chills whenever I think about what my friend and his mom must have gone through.Cop here. Most hair raising call I've ever been on was a call where a female called 911 without her boyfriend knowing. He had beaten the hell out of her. She called 911 but left her phone in her purse. My dispatchers could hear an altercation in the background and  used their magic to find the address. Several of us are responding to the area with the fancy lights and wee-woo's going. He heard the sirens from far out (we shut down as we get close) and assumes we are going somewhere close. Remember, he has no idea she called so he isn't expecting us to be coming to his house. As we are surrounding the house he says to his girlfriend ""I'm gonna go shoot at the cops."" Our dispatcher heard this and is relaying the information. About that time the female gets on the phone and tells us he just went out the back door with a gun. He had barely touched grass when 4 cops were drawn down on him. Thankfully he made a smart decision to drop his gun (yes, he did actually come out with a gun) and everyone went home that day. Just serves as a reminder how fast my job can go from mind numbingly boring to absolute terror.

What genius came up with this euphemism for a surcharge. Pizza Hut: ""Your hostage negotiator will be there in 30 mins or less, or your next hostage situation is free."" [deleted]Does ""this ticket is voided"" mean they didn't make the pizza?

Because that would be fucked up. Just because my coked- up husband with a knife is threatening to kill me and my two kids does NOT mean I don't want my fucking pepperoni pizza.

Yes, it was Pizza Hut. No, I didn't put it in the title. (/r/hailcorporate!)

And here's a news article if you're interested in the details:

http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/local/2015/05/05/pizza-order-reveals-hostage-situation/26935521/""You said you want sausage?""

""No - HOSTage - I'm being held....""

""*Hold* the sausage?""

""NO! MY BOYFRIEND IS HOLDING ME HOSTAGE""
I can only imagine what happened after they called the police.

""Thank you officer, please let us know how it goes, we're all thinking about her...  Oh, one more thing.  Do we... do we, make the pizza?

'Cause they kinda have a clock on us here, once an order goes in we're on the hook for it.  Alonia has the pie in the oven and it's gonna be a good one.  If you wanna swing by when you're going to rescue her, or Steve could just jut over in his Grandma's Gremlin so you guys have something to nosh on while you're chatting with her abusive partner.""

""Extra breadsticks? No problem officer!""
I love how , despite being in a hostage situation, she -Really- wanted pepperoni. She paid extraPolice were called at the same time the pizza was ordered. Pizza still got there first.Does Pizza Hut always charge a Convenience Fee with every 911 order...and does a 911 order then come with free breadsticks?[Here's a link to the actual story](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3069951/Woman-seeks-rescue-boyfriend-online-pizza-order.html)[deleted]$2.75 FREEDOM FEE[Here's the Washington Post Article about the incident](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/06/woman-held-hostage-uses-pizza-hut-order-call-for-help/)She wasn't kidnapped long enough to suffer from Stockholm Syndrome but wasn't fed at all during her ordeal so she started suffering from Sicilian Syndrome.

> The history of the figure is rather incredible. It was found in 1887 in a peat bog near Slupsk. When the figure was examined it turned out to be the amulet of a bear hunter, originating from the Neolithic period. It was dated at between 1700 B.C. and 650 B.C. Since the researchers were not precise regarding the age of the find, we can assume this figure is over three thousand years old. The original did not stay long in Slupsk since special protection was sought for the oldest item ever discovered in the Pomerania. The museum in Szczecin guaranteed safety, and the amber bear was placed there - probably until 1945. However, the people of Slupsk found it difficult to cope with the loss of the amulet of happiness - in 1924 the guild of amber makers decided to make a copy. Arthur Fischer was the author of the faithfully reproduced new bear of happiness, and the figure became the pride of the amber collection presented in the City Museum in Nowa Brama. The figure delighted the eyes of the inhabitants of Slupsk until March 1945 - when it was stolen, along with all amber and gold jewellery. Thanks to an unknown stroke of fate, the copy encountered the original, after many years, in the Historic Museum in Stralsund. In the summer of 2002, the German press announced that the copy of the bear was presented to public, whereas the original amulet did not leave the museum's safe. It is a secret how the museum became the owner of these two figures. However one should be happy that both of them survived. The copy of the famous bear appeared again in the history of Slupsk. Thanks to the president, Maciej Kobylinski, the amber bear attracts tourists tothe town hall, where it is exhibited in a special show case. Once a year, the tiny figure is put on auction, and the funds raised are dedicated to charity. The figure is replaced by a new copy in the show case. The first beneficiaries of the bear were the single mothers of three severely sick children. Thanks to the generosity of entrepreneurs from Slupsk, who participated in the auction, the little figure brought lots of joy to the homes of the sick children. This winning bear was also given by the inhabitants of Slupsk to the president of the Republic of Poland - Aleksander Kwasniewski. The amber figure arouses sympathy, and therefore its association with Slupsk is enjoyable. Let it always bring well-being to our underprivileged city. 3500 year old gummy bear! I mean who doesn't eat the legs first? If there's a mosquito stuck in there I bet we could use its DNA to finally recreate bears.

Description
*the mighty bear amulet passed down through the generations of the great bear fighter tribe of the great River, this was forged by the legendary bear slayer Smasher Basher! Blessed with the power of strength this amulet will give you the power of the BEAR!*TIL the arms and legs on bears are a relatively new thing.Things like this really make me feel connected to the someone in the past. It's so easy to be detached from our ancient ancestors. There are very few things that connect us to them in a tangible way. But this...this does it for me. A person made this with his own hands. They may have made it as a good luck charm for hunting. Or perhaps it was a gift for a new spouse. Maybe it was just something to bring him/her joy in a world that always seemed to be little more than a struggle for survival. Hell, maybe it was even a trinket for a spoiled princess or little more than a tiny figurine for a child to play with. It doesn't really matter. 

Someone made this with their hands. For this person the sky was still something untouchable, and the stars were gods. There were no seconds, hours or months - only seasons. Nature was still something to be feared and in awe of, not mostly ignored like it is today. My existence is completely different than his/hers in almost every conceivable way. But this object brings us close together. It's simple and features a shape I can recognize and appreciate. Even if it doesn't look like an actual bear it resembles it enough for me to understand it. It's human in that way. 

I'm not sure any of this makes much sense. I'm struggling to articulate why an object like this moves me. It's [Glottis!](http://gerezon.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/glottis.jpg)[Info](http://www.slupcio.slupsk.edu.pl/english.php).

In Mozambique they have employed trained [giant pouched rats](http://i.imgur.com/XhXooNP.jpg) to detect mines because they are smart enough to be trained, have a great sense of smell and are light enough not to detonate the mines. They have helped clear a few thousand landmines already in Mozambique alone.

The pouched rates of Mozambique sound like a much more effective solution.They need to build a ruggedized tactical Roomba and name it  BOOMba. Maybe some of the those guys who build their bots for robot wars could be enlisted.Too bad it doesn't work very well, often times it's too light to set off a mine.

The trade off is, light enough for it to be moved by the wind vs heavy enough to set off the mine.

Dear students, 

At approximately 9:50 a.m. this morning, an incident occurred in the Criss Library where a student allegedly pulled a pocket knife on another student. 

Reports indicate that the student who pulled the knife was asked to not talk so loudly on his cell phone.

After the student allegedly showed the knife, three students quickly subdued him. The students held him him place, away from the knife, until UNO security appeared on the scene and took control of the situation. OPD was immediately called and is now taking the lead on the investigation.

Counseling was immediately called to the library to serve as a resource to all parties involved, including the students who subdued the student with knife as well as any students in the area.

No students were injured during this incident and the library is open and secure.

Reminds me of the kid who stabbed someone at my high school.

So one day this kid who was regularly in trouble ""stabbed"" another kid at school. Being high school, word got around fast and by the end of the day the rumors made it seem like he [samurai sworded someone's head off](http://i.imgur.com/MHgOmYG.gifv). I think in reality it was just a small slash but still pretty troublesome nonetheless. 

So he went for 2 years at a school for troublemakers, or kids who got expelled. 

Then he got to return to school for our Senior year. God bless this kid, he came into school with a shirt that he made that read ""Stabby is back"" 

Fucking hilarious. I think he made it half the day before they made him change into his gym shirt. [this](https://twitter.com/_dyanrowning/status/596026873735319552)also happened on the same campus today. *just gonna put some jam on this bread for a brain snack while i study*

Back in my day, a college student was happy to have one knife and maybe a handful of bees.Dude in the green sweater is my buddy and is active duty infantry. Poor little knife puller...

EDIT: Yeah it's grey. Colors are hard...

EDIT 2: The backstory is the best. My buddy asked the knife guy to keep it down and that ""no one wants to hear your personal shit, take it out side"". Knife guy proceeds to say ""I'll do what I want, fuck you. I'll kick your ass."" Knife guy stands up and pulls out the knife. My buddy grabs his wrist and twists it while a third guy tries to take the knife. My buddy then throws a quick punch to the face, and gets him to the ground. Knife guy goes for the second knife, which is grabbed and tossed it to the side. The rest is history.

The process that gave us the majority of published sheet music was actually MUCH more labor intensive: published music was engraved by hand as a negative on a metal plate. Handwritten manuscript was used as a source.

Another way of producing music was with photographic reprints.  Engravers would create a page of a score the size of an entire room, photograph it, then shrink it down for a 8.5x11 print.

And black ice creamSalt Lake City!My roommate from college was the manager at this Jimmy Johns for a while. (4th South and 5th East, downtown SLC). He told me it's because the building is protected as a historical site. Used to be a Snelgrove's Ice Cream shop. The state wouldn't allow JJ's to take it off, so they painted over it. 

Edit: /u/Paradox beat me to it. Should have read the comments first. my god I live in a small town just lousy with redditorsIn related news, all this rain Salt Lake City is getting sure is great!Jimmy John's John.Salt Lake City! Right off 7th East and 4th south. Gotta love Jimmy Johns.

His labs are pretty cool and even have some space dedicated to teaching science to local youth programs. His main research these days is centered around battery technology, but I can't say much more than that. 
At the time I visited he had just won a MAJOR lawsuit against hasbro over the super soaker. His CFO looked like he had just won the lottery.

Aa someone who has rescued SEVERAL bats from his home and worked with local bat sanctuaries quite a few times, I wanna tell OP something.

* Yes, get the shot, but don't worry about it at all.   The odds are insanely low that the bat actually has rabies, and if it didn't bite you, the odds are slimmer still that you could contract it.  Rabid animals tend to behave in atypical ways.  This bat was in a dark area during the daytime and behaving defensively rather than aggressively.  I'm not a bat expert, but that seems like pretty normal bat behavior to me. 

* **CALL A BAT SANCTUARY!!** Bats are friends!  They eat mosquitos and all sorts of shitty bugs.  It may also be injured as it chose a low hiding spot rather than a high one.  Depending on what state you live in, killing it may be illegal as well. 

That's pretty much the end of what I have to say. This cave smells terrible, and mine is filled with shit.Who's that Pokemon?

Pleasantly surprised.ITT: RabiesBats behaving oddly can be an indication of being ill such as rabies.  Be careful.You have bathlete's foot.I'm amazed that people find bats disgusting; they're so lovely. Delicate wings, usually smudge-nosed faces, furry... what's not to like? I know they have sharp teeth but so do lots of other animals we love (cats anybody?). I once rescued a bat that got trapped in our house and nearly drowned in a bowl of water; it was the most vulnerable, gentle little thing.Do you keep your shoes hanging from the ceiling of a cave?You got a bat in your shoe, bro.

Then someone was super rude and threatened me because she thought I stole her car, so I stopped doing it.

Money talks.


EDIT:  For context, it's a ~200 car car park on the beach.  There is a clear sign at the entrance saying the time you must leave by before the water arrives.   Some city people don't understand the sign and assume it just means they get a fine for staying too late.   Then theres also a few who get their keys wet while swimming and the car won't go without it, then the surfing waves come and wash the car away.I wonder how long it took to get that far down?Used to live at Daytona beach, seen this happen way too many times and once a idiot in a mobile home had his stuck after the tide came in and took awhile to get that out I live in Washington state and it is legal and common practice to drive on the beach. If you follow the designated drive and parking areas you'll be fine. 

There's a guy who has a towing business at a nearby beach that pulls people out and puts it on YouTube. It's actually kind of funny and usually makes fun of people for it. Here's one of him pulling out a Jeep: https://youtu.be/0LufILfiEqYAh that reminds me of the time we forgot our tractor on the beach whilst it was low tide. Had to wait 8 hours to retrieve it, but it was still operational. I have a sinking feeling about this. ~ George Takei in 2 weeks when he reposts this.

WOO PARK ON THE BEACH!  DRINK LITE BEER!  DANCE ALL NIGHT WITH HOT CHICKS...

oh wait...You don't have to drive it back to Germany to get the oil changed, but you can try!YOu can drive on the beach In Pismo CA. 

To get to the dunes you would have to drive across a river. People would sit there at high tide and wait for cars to get stuck. 
They would tell the $100 or it goes into the sea. 

The state decided to stop this predatory act so now they have a dedicated tow company. 

They charge $300 just to show up and pull you out for. This is just if you get stuck in the sand and need to be pulled 5 ft. 
It costs much more if you really get stuck in the water. 

The towing company pays the sate about $15k a year for the contract plus 4% of the towing and all storage fees. source

>Captain Kevin Oprey stands beneath the soaring hull of Cunard's flagship Queen Mary 2, the largest and most expensive Ocean Liner ever built, a mile off the coast of Bali on Sunday during the ship's Round World Voyage in its 10th anniversary year.  

> Captain Oprey surveys the scene from the top of Queen Mary 2's bulbous bow, an underwater projection that minimises the creation of bow waves around the waterline when the ship is under way.  
Two safety craft were standing by during the photo-shoot, but Captain Oprey remained sure-footed throughout.  

> Queen Mary 2 will make her 10th call at Sydney on Friday 14 March 2014 after circumnavigating Australia, and then heads north towards Shanghai, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok and Singapore before turning west for Sri Lanka and Dubai, entering the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal and returning to the UK in time to mark the 10th anniversary of becoming Cunard's flagship, with sister ships Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria joining in the celebrations in Southampton on 9 May 2014.  

>In her first 10 years of operation, following a spectacular naming by Her Majesty The Queen on 8 January 2004, Queen Mary 2 has undertaken more than 420 voyages including over 200 Transatlantic Crossings and called at 182 ports in 60 countries.  

>At 151,200 tons, Queen Mary 2 accommodates 2,620 passengers and 1,253 crew.  
She remains the longest, tallest, widest ocean liner ever built as well as being the most famous and fastest passenger ship in operation today.

Source: worked in microbiology lab and made stuff like this all the time. There are millions of different types of bacteria hanging out everywhere, on everything, all the timeDon't give the insane helicopter parents yet another reason to douse their kids in hand sanitizer and wrap them in bubble wrap!http://i.imgur.com/rtGZnb3.jpg

From /r/MicrobiologyThat is why kids needs to play outside.  They build up immunity from shit like that.  You keep them inside and constantly disinfect them and everything they touch and you are going to have a weak, asthmatic kid who gets sick at the drop of a hat.
On top of all of the other reasons not to freak out about this, it's worth noting that these bacteria were cultured in a safe, incubated, food-rich environment under perfect growing conditions. It's likely that some of those spots came from *single bacteria* that never would have survived to make a visible colony without such an ideal environment.As someone recently finished a PhD in Microbiology: this is not much different from what you'd find after you've washed your hands. Maybe a little more variety. It's not a big dealThis is actually very healthy, bacteria are our best friends. 

I once saw a BBC documentary on why in our current society a lot of children get allergies since our current lifestyle takes place inside four walls and a roof. This has as a result that our immune system will become lazy, or won't develop like it should. Which can cause all types of allergies, hay fever is a very common one. This is not proven by the way, but the hypothesis is rock solid.

IIRC, they checked the amount of children with allergic symptoms in an African tribe. One in threehundred had allergy type symptoms whereas in the UK it was one in three children. 

Kids, get the fuck outside, get dirty as hell and fuck these hand sanitizers.Where's the control from before he went outside?If you did both the left and right hand, would you be able to tell if the kid is left or right-handed?Any idea how much of that was the good, normal bacteria found on yours hands as a defense, and how many are harmful in any way?I saw the picture before reading the title and thought it was a plate of candy. This may explain why I get sick so much.I hope this doesn't get passed around as ""proof"" that germaphobes and helicopters parents that carry around hand sanitizer are right. This shows nothing compared to a normal person under normal circumstances, I imagine that it's not that different, if at all.So how does that compare to the palm prints of office workers, nurses, surgeons, housewives, garbagemen,....?   Standing alone, this image is plenty sensational, but it doesn't carry any information about where it *really* stands in the spectrum of overall germiness.  Fascinating. Now we know why outdoors kids are a little healthier than others.this is always so wrong, most of these bacteria arent even dangerous, it just looks bad and this is what makes people germophobic. 

stop doing this, you aren't helping anyone And today in the News, shock report! there is bacteria on stuff, if you go outside you will get covered in bacteria and despite the fact that you're immune system is specifically evolved to deal with this and is as much of a problem as 1 speck of dust to a Dyson we are going to intimate that you will DIE if you so much as touch anything, that's how we get the ads in front of you guys.

ELL         You guys have some truly absurd weather in the US...Seriously, is there an explanation why Texas is getting pummeled with so much rain and storms this year?Is that the general explanation for the greenish tinge that accompanies the arrival of really nasty weather?Just moved to Texas in September. The weather here is not to be fucked with. I had never experienced thunder that set off car alarms. We had more tornadoes in two weeks than I had ever experienced in 22 years in Indiana.http://i.imgur.com/jDyQjJy.jpgFalse. That is definitely a portal to another dimension... pff, idiots. 
Actually it's preferential scattering of the light. Red gets absorbed, blue gets transmitted. It's the same reason the sky itself is blue. If this photo had been taken against a reddish sunset, the color would have been closer to green than blue. Reflection and scattering are different things from a physics standpoint. Mommy is Texas going to die?Sad I'm never going to see amazing sights like these where I live. On the other hand, aurora borealis is pretty neat.I never thought i would ever see weinert on the internet. I used to live in Haskell, which is about 10 miles south of Weinert.

Jamie Hyneman's 'Arborist' Quadcopter Test: https://youtu.be/1fe9IDx3vCsThat is the mother fucking saw from Mario Brothers that runs on those goddamn wires. HOLY SHIT! I've seen this thing in action before. I was at my house in Wisconsin and some guys knocked on our door. They told us that we'd have to move to a different location while they cut down some trees nearby our house. A power line runs between our house and the suburb a couple hundred feet over. In comes a helicopter just like this one loudly sawing away at the trees near the power lines. It was in and out in a few minutes.

I just realized I'm bad at telling stories. I thought it was cool to watch though!

[Here's a video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpwZ6c6ykNk)One of these crashed near my house last year. I believe it killed the pilot. They were from South Carolina I think, but they were in Ohio clearing a bike path. IIRC, the engine gave out and the pilot couldn't do anything. He was able to keep it from hitting anybody on the ground at least. Looks like the type of thing I try to build in Besiege...This looks like something from Besiege.So that's how they do it!

About 3 weeks later I saw him back again and I asked why he was back.  He said ""They found the snake.""  They did.My buddy has one and he randomly escaped one day and he was gone for a month, my buddy expected the worst...then one day there his lizard was, back in his cage like nothing happened.This reminds me of college. 4 of my friends rented a house and one of them had a Tokay Gecko named Keyser Soze, which ended up escaping. 

These 4 guys kept this house in perpetual disaster. In south Ga any home kept in this state would soon become a Joe's Apartment sequel. But for some reason you would never see any roaches or bugs feeding off of trash and partially discarded things.

Nearly a year later, while crashing at their house I went to the fridge for another beer when I saw a blur scurry across the surface of the fridge door. It freaked me out because the kitchen light was out. ""Mice can't do that!....Mice can't do that!"" I shouted out loud. 

I grabbed a flash light and cautiously approached the space between the fridge and the wall. As soon as I turned the flash light on I was greeted by Keyser Soze's satan like hiss. That mean ill tempered fat bastard had been doing just fine while keeping the house pest free. I can imagine your coworker making fun of you. While you slowly become mad, start walking around the shop with a net, talking to yourself. You grow a beard, can't sleep at night. You see the lezard everywhere.The pet shop I used to work at had a lot of escapees. I remember the time 8 feet of Burmese Python fell from the ceiling in front of me when I was playing with a puppy to give it exercise. We had a lizard escape at my house. Didn't see him for an entire year. After a while we got a puppy. One time I couldn't find the dog so I called for him again and again. He finally came over, but there was something in his mouth. It was a completely dried out lizard. My dog solved the mystery. I still have no idea where he found it. There were two leopard geckos that escaped when they were super tiny, as small as petsmart ever carried them. They went under the reptile cage unit and we couldn't get them out.

Lucky for the geckos we we had at least a dozen crickets escape from our bins each day and there were always cockroaches running around.

3yrs later and those two were fat and happy, still with the run of the store. I'd only see them at night after closing and it was always from a few aisles away. Last I heard they'd never been caught but no one has seen them for a couple years now.There was a big albino corn loose in our shop years ago as well.  Every one thought I was nuts and that it surely was dead and gone. But I kept finding shed so I knew. 3 years after it's initial escape I found it basking on our front steps where it had gotten out after we propped the door open. If I were your coworker I would say that lizard is actually my pet lizard I just brought in and let loose to mess with you and ask for it back. Then the next day release it again in the store and get everyone else to ignore any signs of it to make you question your sanity.

Edit: Thanks for the gold benevolent stranger.The pet store near my house has a [Tokay Gecko](http://imgur.com/Q7mVUYj) infestation. They say it's been that way for 20 years or so, and if a kid finds one they are allowed to keep it as long as they buy a terrarium for it. I went to my local shop the other day for some fishies and helped find an escapee! They had the rodent cages ""down for maintenance"" and during checkout I spotted a fancy albino rat. The worker was absolutely horrified to see it, I don't think she liked rats much because he was very obviously a pet rat, not an albino street rat or something. Anyway, kinda nice to know its not just my local store with escapees![Here](http://i.imgur.com/raMd5lx.jpg) he is back in his cage. Waiting...Judging by all the love this post is getting, I guess you should change his name from ""Bigfoot"" to ""Karma Chameleon""...Uhhhh OP I hate to break this to you but there's nothing there that's just an empty netHis feet do actually look quite large. Huh.My snake disappeared and I thought the dog ate him. Turns out he was hiding in my mattress for two weeks.We have a couple dwarf hamsters lost in mine! We have competing theories. I believe they've created a tiny little colony and are living off the food we spill under the cages. Others believe they're just dead. I'm staying optimistic like OP!My suite mate's Savannah Monitor, Charlie Murphy, got loose, and for a month, we assumed he'd left the building or died in one of the heaters.  One day while actually having sex with my real girlfriend, I hear her scream ""CHARLIE MURPHY!""  I jumped out of bed naked, scooped him up, and ran around the house buck naked with him as a victory lap!  

I miss college.  Story time! I used to own a 5ft iguana (Iggy) and I let him roam the house like a dog would. I used a huge jewelery case as his cage and he would go in it to use the bathroom and drink water. Most of the time Iggy would chill out on top of the radiator but during the summer he was especially hyper and would sometimes run out the front door. He would climb the tall bushes in the front yard and scare the shit out of people. Funny enough, the only way to lure him down was with pizza. Iggy sure loved his pizzaWasn't something exactly like this posted almost a month ago or so?I used to work at a pet store back in the day and 2 tokay geckos got loose once. in case you're unaware Tokay Geckos are mean as fuck and will bite the shit out of you for no reason. they also make death rattle like from The Grudge when they are pissed. so for the course of a year or so it was like a horror movie. you never knew when you would stick your hand in the back of a shelf and hear their war cry and you just knew you're about to get the shit bit it out of you. Heard one about a pet shop where their fish kept disappearing from the fishtank every night. So one night the owner stays late, and he hears a splash sound. And a SQUID takes off the lid, crawls into the next tank, eats a fish, and goes back into his own tank. It's only a matter of time before they knock us off our position at the top of the food chain. Squids with machine guns man. That's what's coming.I'd get him checked out for metabolic bone disease. That's a year without calcium/d3 supplements or proper lighting.Toadaso. I fuckin a toadasoWhen I was younger I spent about two years working at petco.  Our store had a fully functioning ecosystem outside of the enclosures. We'd spot snakes, lizards, hamsters, mice, rats...you name it.

Sometimes we have to move the full-size ones and it requires the use of a giant shovel and they hiss the entire time and want to kill you.Rule #1: Anything that gets near a Snapping Turtle's mouth is food until it changes its mind.

Rule #2: Snapping Turtles do not change their minds when it comes to food.I fucking love snapping turtles. I move them off of roadways every chance I get. I tell people it's for the turtle's safety, but honestly I just like being near the giant turtles.

Edit: missed a word and punctuation I saw a snapper a little smaller than that on the road once. I grabbed a decent sized stick to scoot it off of the road. That sucker stretched it's neck out at incredible speed and snapped the end off that stick. I decided it wasn't worth a finger to try to move it.That's a snapping turtle.

Some snapping turtles have a sac they can extrude out into the water and wave around so that it functions like a very crude gill.

The sac extends out of their cloaca.

Basically, it's ass.I took these last summer, about 2 weeks apart. the one of the guy on the yellow line looks smaller, but that fucker was HUGE I was a little bit scared to get closer!

http://i.imgur.com/aPbcO6I.jpgIn one of my old neighborhoods we had a problem with snapping turtles put-putting around. One of my neighbors caught one and put it in a wheel barrel to bring down to the rock quarry. He then found another one and put it in with the first. I have NEVER heard anything like that in my life. Lesson learned: don't go near snapping turtles and DO NOT enclose more than one in an area that small. Interestingly [turtles are a distant relative to dinosaurs](https://chickenoreggblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/reptiletree.jpg) while birds are not only direct descendants of certain dinosaurs, they phylogenetically *are* dinosaurs. Interesting to think about the next time you see a pigeon, chicken, or a [cassowary](http://biologypop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cassowary-drumming.jpg).

Look at them [dinosaur feet](http://creepyanimals.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/cassowary.jpg).Odds are she's crossing the road and there is a nest of her babies across the street, keep your eye out for em they can camouflage them self's quite nicely in the asphalt.PSA since it's spring and turtles are waking up and breeding.

If you see a turtle/tortiose crossing the road, help it across in the direction it was going. Typically these are females looking to lay their eggs and they don't always nest near water.

Source: Volunteered at a wildlife hospital, pretty much every hit-by-car turtle/tortoise we got was female, including a snapper like in OP's pic that was hit by 3 trucks (she lived and was released)! Most of these cases were in spring-early summer.Snapping turtles are no joke. Last summer I almost hit one with my car when it was trying to cross the road. I got all upset and decided I was going to rescue it and bring it to the other side. I had no idea what it was--I thought it was just a huge ass regular dopey turtle. I reached down and picked it up and quickly realized my mistake when it almost sliced open my wrist. It was MAD AS SHIT. I gave up, started to walk back to my car and then decided that I was not going to let a turtle defeat me. I went back to my car, grabbed my huge winter coat, went back to the dinosaur and threw the coat over him. I picked him up (at least 45lbs), helped him cross, and plopped him down in a  ditch. The inside of my coat had tears in it. I felt like a goddamn hero.That thing is awesome. I want to be friends with it.That's just Tokka looking for Rahzar.

A very weird but awesome war movie about a mother rescuing her son during the 2008 Georgian-Russian War. It's also an incredibly pro-Russian propaganda piece but it does have fantastic battle scenes. 

There's some weird fantasy elements to it from a child's perspective as he tries to understand or distract himself from what is going on around him. Rather unusual. KUWABARA KUWABARA!I might believe it's still in use if I saw at least one damn car on it. Better than the bridges in Montreal WHAT is your favorite colour?!Christ, I hope no one in this thread sees the specifications for a modern aeroplane because if you're funny about crossing some questionably stable wood and rope you're gonna shit a brick when you learn the factor of safety for most aircraft is a decimal.

Schools of fighting fish will probably attack and destroy the bridge and/or Doflamingo will fly down and kill everyone.Looks like they still even drive on it.

Hey. This design looks like our Canadian engineer's iron ring. If only ours were made from meteorite as well. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_RingThe price must be astronomical.Early settlers in Greenland used to make weapons out of meteoric iron.  There wasn't a lot to mine there and shipping was long and expensive so the Scandinvavian settlers would work with the natives to find meteoric iron.  Their weapons are known for being remarkably short due to the low supply.  I'd rather not have a ring that rusts.Arthur Dayne wore that ring.That looks incredibly uncomfortable to wear.  The scoring marks are on the inside and outside.  When your love is out of this world...I REALLY wanted a meteorite wedding ring until I found out that they will rust.  That really killed it for me.
All I can think about is the Joe Dirt scene with his lucky meteor. Almost as cool as a space sword, try not to throw it away Shouldn't we have a specific metal named here?

If so has it been brought to a wildlife center? 

That owl looks like it still has it's premature down feathers - which means it's still fairly young. Probably isn't a risk of human imprinting but please don't hold onto it and have it taken care of as soon as possible by a professional. You don't know what it's been through so it may be unsafe to just put it back in the wild. Here's what you do now. 

1. Print out a Hogwarts acceptance letter off the internet. 

2. In the space where the student's name goes, write some gibberish and smudge it up so it's unreadable.

3. Put it in an envelope and attach it to the owl.

4. Wait until dinner time and drive to the house of your nearest neighbor with young children. 

5. Throw the bird as hard as you can against the dining room window.
Owls always look like they're judging you.Put bells on your outdoor cats so they don't decimate bird populations.This is adorable baby owl, but it also brings up a startling fact: **Outdoor cats are killing billions of animals each year and are blamed for the permanent extinction of 33 species worldwide.**

Outdoor cats are responsible for so much ecological damage. They don't just kill birds and their young, but also reptiles, amphibians and small rodents. 

Outdoor cats can also increase the number of rats in an area. Rats will show up to eat cat food left outside for outdoor cats, and cats are too well fed to risk a fight with a full-grown rat that can kill them.

This is not just feral cats, this is outdoor pet cats as well. I encourage any cat owner that loves their pet to make their cats indoor only. Not only the responsible thing to do, but it's also safer for you cat (cats get trapped in garages, basements, storm drains,  forgotten traps and sewers and die long deaths due to starvation). 

Cat feces spread diseases and also pollute rivers and lakes, killing even more wildlife in the process. 

Please talk to your friends and family and help save species like that owl. Even if the baby survived, the cat might have interrupted a very delicate cycle that will cost the wild population dearly.

We must *kill* blue jay.""This basically has to be a composite. All these birds can be seen pretty easily in the Eastern US, but they don't congregate like this, because they like different foods and environments. I'm not a massive birder, but never in my years of casual birdwatching and backyard bird feeding have I seen these four species in such close proximity at the same time.

The cardinal pair is fine - cardinals are often seen like this, traveling together. The male cardinal looks rather fluffed-up compared to the other birds, as if it were a colder day when he was photographed, though. And the goldfinch on the left I could even believe, since if you put out a lot of sunflower hearts in a feeder you'll get both these birds to show up.

But orioles aren't seed-eaters like those other two. If you want them to show up at a feeder, you're going to want to put out fruit, like orange halves, or even grape jelly. And then the bluebird at the right, they won't go much for any of the above. Bluebirds don't show up much at feeders, unless you put out plenty of mealworms, and even then it may take them a long time to notice.

The other thing is that the fence is stretching off away from the camera, but that oriole appears smaller than he should be. They're pretty-good sized songbirds, and should look bigger next to that bluebird than this one does.

You just won everybody else's failed attempts. [deleted]My dad once got his hook snagged on a riverbank.

When he retrieved it, it was tangled in a huge snarl of fishing line with a $300 graphite rod on the other end. (The reel was shot, and he had to replace the rotten cork grip, but the rod was in great shape. He used it for 30+ years until he lost it in Alaska.What kind of fish was he trying to catch with a lure like that?!No fucking way would I pick that up.  With my luck I'd get 8 hooks in my hand.Go find a bar on the water and sell it to them.  I bet someone would pay for that.  Then double whatever they offer you and tell them you want to trade it for a bar tab in that amount.  It costs them nothing, and they get something cool.I used to do this back home on a river where salmon would spawn every year.  Because most fish don't eat when they are on a spawning run, particularly salmon, fisherman resort to snagging with weighted hooks, which is also an illegal practice.  Most of these hooks would be weighted with lead, nuts, bolts, heavy wrapped wire, really anything that would make them sink faster and land into the side of a fish.  A few years ago, I decided to head over to the river in the summer to hunt for some snagged lures with a couple scuba tanks, just to see if I could possibly find some new lures to use for myself.  What I ended up coming across within an hour was about 300 pounds of illegal weighted snagging hooks instead.  After reporting the find to the DNR I took all back home and spend the next two days melting down every last hook I had, with the exception of ones that didn't use lead as weights, overall I ended up with 70 pounds of lead!  Every last bit of that remolded lead was turned into weights that I used for scuba, I still think it's the best find I ever came across. Looks like all the failed attempts on Plenty of FishIT'S AN ANGLER FISH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAThe thumbnail looks like a bunch of tacosYet another reason why i cant swim in water that i cant see through...

Could you imagine stepping on that??Hey that's me! I can validate after work today I just wanted to comment on a few things. This was snagged in a larger section of the Maumee River in Maumee, Ohio. I'm assuming most of this is from the walleye run earlier in the year because the hooks are not rusted. I was wading in about 3 foot of water so retrieving was not an issue. my line did not break because there was some give in the mass, then I saw the neon colors. There was a dead fish attached which I believe someone hooked legitimately and then tangled up in this mess. All I want the photo to do is remind people that if it is safe, to retrieve your lures. This is only one instance, I can't imagine how many more of these are out there. For someone who goes wade fishing frequently, This could turn deadly for someone who got their foot caught in it and fell over. I will respond more this evening!I looked at the picture and wondered how many barbs are in him right now.Oh my God. Do you know what this is? This is a lure nest. The lures are breeding. holy crap....enough jigs to open his own bait shopget it mounted
How in the world did his line not breakDoes no one else see the environmental issue here?

Edit: Hey, thanks for the gold!!Maumee River? I have been diving off Vancouver Island and there's a certain pinnacle we would dive.  I found dozens of down rigger balls that had struck the pinnacle and were cut free or broken loose.  I swam abound and stacked them into a big pile.  Too heavy to lift but doing the math it was several hundred dollars of down rigger as well as the plastic clips that hold the line. Fitting- thats about all power grubs are good for, snags.glad to see the fishing community have been very good environmental stewards!My buddy snagged a line with a lure once... You wouldn't believe it but there was a fish caught on the line he snagged up. Pretty incredible.Reminds me of a [Rat King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_king_%28folklore%29).That is way better than a fish.

[Bird's-eye view for context.](http://www.gardaconcierge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sirmione.jpg)

> The Scaliger Castle (13th century). This is a rare example of medieval port fortification, which was used by the Scaliger fleet. The building of this complex started in 1277 by Mastino della Scala. It presents the typical Ghibelline swallowtail merlons and the curtain-walls (with three corner towers) in pebbles alternating with two horizontal bands of brick courses. The walls on the inside were finished with plaster with graffiti, simulating blocks of stone. The castle stands at a strategic place at the entrance to the peninsula. It is surrounded by a moat and it can only be entered by two drawbridges. The caste was established mainly as a protection against enemies, but also against the locals. The main room houses a small museum with local finds from the Roman era and a few medieval artifacts.

I've built this kingdom up from nothing. When
I started here, all there was was swamp. All the kings said I was daft to build a castle in a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank into the
swamp. So I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. An' that's what your gonna get, lad -- the strongest castle in these islands.Good video with a bit of info and more views of the castle and surrounding area.

Apparently the castle isn't sinking, but rather that part with all the water in it is actually a guarded port... but it's on a lake, soooo... ?What this photo doesn't show is behind the camera there is a lovely peninsula filled with shops, homes and a tiny one lane draw bridge where both cars and people fight for the right of way.Looks like one of those fortresses from Windwaker.Here is Germany's sinking:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z78V_oo21KcStick a pirate ship in the middle with some water guns, and that would make an awesome water park.But it's not...I've been here! 
Have to say though - that isn't sinking. It's a port with fortifications attached to a v. cool castle. (and no, you can't swim in there - I asked)
This is Sirmione, a small town at the bottom of Lake Garda. It's a stunning place and you have to cross a moat to get into the town. There's only one road through it, with the vast majority closed to traffic. 
It's famous for its ice cream and with good reason - it is amazing.

Masskrugstemmen is a pub sport involving holding a standard german 1L glass stein out for a prolonged period. The weight of stein and beer is known to be ~5#. Assuming she isnt using some plastic mug... Ill stick with my estimate. 

I dont know if they make 11kg dumbbells....But I guarantee you they make 5# ones and thats why I think of it as 5# and a liter of beer in a mug. sorry iof the mixed units are confusing some.

I go through that intersection near LAX about 5 times a week. Ironically, it was towed through it on it's way to the California Science Center. 

Finally got to see it in it's temp structure (after watching it land and when it was towed) two weeks ago yesterday with visiting friends.

also, before you ask why both pictures show two different ""routes"", it was because the aircraft did its final circles around our base before departing for good.

 Obviously there is a reason, but I'm not an architect. Not a fan, too much going onI like the vertical window add on the front masonry wall, it's a nice touch. The switch from separated stairs to a continuous poured stair is also nice but you did lose some of the line in the process. Someday that tree in the front will be a problem and kick at the foundation (just removed a tree much farther away from the edge of the house that will be problematic though a bigger tree) Does the homeowner care about the neighbors? the front porch does not speak to the rest of the neighborhood in any way (not that it has to but it's just an observation). Gutters? Rest of the floor plan?

I would like to live in a house like that, GG OP.as a landscape architect, that planting design is awful. the house looks cool, thought.That looks like a rendering...As the photographer... it is a real photo. Sorry to burst some bubbles but some people are complete idiots. The grass was extremely nice, and the front driveway was long enough for me to get back and fit the whole building in the frame.

1)  The artist understands what people want pretty well, but has missed the single most important development:  miniaturization.  There is just no way a person from the 30s could have conceived of this.

2)  The artist completely overestimates how much courtesy people in the future would give each other.  Headphones?

The bison reliefs are two feet in length, eighteen inches in height and about 3-4 inches deep. They are modelled in clay, and their surface was given a wet finish in order to make them smooth. The plastic texture is such that the sculptor's finger marks are still visible along the length of the animals. The bisons' shaggy mane and beard appear to be carved with a tool, but the jaws are traced by the sculptor's fingernail. The impression given is one of immense naturalistic beauty. The female bison is ready to mate, while the Bull is sniffing the air. Both animals are supported by a central rock, and are unbelievably well preserved (proving perhaps that there was never a passage connecting the Tuc d'Audoubert cave with the Trois Freres), although they have suffered some drying out, which has caused some cracks to appear across their bodies. Also in the chamber are two other bison figures, both engraved on the ground.

Prehistorians have theorized that the a small group of people (including a child) remained in the Tuc d'Audoubert cave with the sole reason of participating in certain ceremonies associated with the cave art. The remote location of the clay bison - beneath a low ceiling at the very end of the upper gallery, roughly 650 metres from the entrance, is consistent with their involvement in some type of ritualistic or shamanistic process.

xpost /r/ArtefactPornTypical reddit not giving the original artist credit.This is pretty cool, some european [cave paintings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe_bison#/media/File:AltamiraBison.jpg) show the now extinct steppe bison that were knocking around at the time but they have differet horns, the horns on these sculptures looks like the [wisent or european buffalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_bison).The original animal crackersThey look like really detailed animal crackers At 650 m inside a cave, you can't just carry a torch and have it light your way for the length of time that these required to create.

Those bison (and other cave art) required a very deliberate process of staging torches at multiple locations for the entry and egress of the cave.  It's a little like cave divers staging O2 bottles at various points to switch out.

When you think about it in this way, the effort gone to in order to create these and other cave art becomes significantly more impressive.i know it's lame, but all i can comment is ""WOW!""Don't tell ISIS.can someone explain how scientists date something to a 14,000 period?They aren't the only ones.

The stories I have access to, of my family and theirs, when faced right in front of life and death decisions; to sell their country, to betray their fellow soldiers. They've chosen death every single time and have come out of it with their honor intact. Some paid it direly, some walked off with demotions and other unavoidable consequences. There's a rumor that even the organized crime has come to respect that.


The reason why I'm daring to share these without my uncle's consent (and THAT is something I do NOT take lightly) is in the hope of shedding light over a couple of easily forgotten facts:


Mexico has a very proud history of standing up to oppression, domestic and international, and they've paid for it with their finest men, in the front line.

You can call out a LOT of Mexicans, for being corrupt, greedy, violent, and so on. But, this country will be damned to hell the day it goes down without the bravest and most honorable having their say. We get frequently dissed for having obsolete weapons due to US regulations in place (not because we want to), and mocked for entertaining one of the most absurd, cynical and corrupt governments of the world.



But just as every other power has done in the past, you'd test your luck the day you try to vanquish us all, because THEN you'll have to deal with the real Mexicans: those who carry on their shoulders both shame and glory of their co-nationals without fanfare, every day, and which do not necessarily belong in the army.


It could be a military family with pride and honor, it could be a teacher that has dealt with troubled youth without even getting paid for decades, a mother with three jobs supporting her children while suffering some disease ailments of her own, an artist that ventures head first into the international scene without a shred of fear, an athlete that works till their last drop of sweat in less than ideal conditions and sometimes without any help, a student that travels many kilometers for many hours every day to aspire for a better life. Those are the ones you never hear about. True bravery is being able to do without witness what anyone would be willing to do before the whole world.


Sure, we're all amigo and tacos... until you get on our bad side. So please, let's get along and cherish our blessings. Do come join us to our slice of paradise with beautiful beaches, jungles, desert. Let's dance to the advent of the 6th sun like our Nahua ancestors did and let's eat the wonderful dishes with exotic spices we've been blessed with... after all, a lot of good men have died for us to be able to do so.



Let's all work out our domestic and international differences in an ordered and well-intentioned way; we will take a lot of flak and get back on our feet many times, but you can trust that we will see it through as long as we keep our freedom and peace... lest the aztec eagle feast on somebody's heart once again, even if it's our own.

I just got patriotic for a country I am not from. I guess propoganda works.Great post OP. On a similar note, Alot of mexican americans fought in WWII but at the time there was only ""white or black"" on the census. Natrually mexicans where considered white (and many still do idenfity as such).

 This is part of why i enjoyed fury because it really made effort to be accurate in what was out there./r/propagandaposters has tons of stuff like this.'Muric...I mean...'Mexica?!Notice the two mountains in the background? Those are actually volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. They are very important to Aztec mythology. Legend has it Iztaccihuatl was an Aztec princess who fell in love with Popocatepetl. When Popocatepetl was sent off to war, she was falsely told by her father that her beloved had died in battle, so in turn she died of grief. When the warrior returned to find his lover dead, he laid her to rest and kneeled beside her body to mourn her death.Here's a good write up on the 201st squadron. [Strike of the Aztec Eagles] (http://www.airartnw.com/aztec_eagles_story.htm) I picked a up a print a while back with the signatures of the few remaining pilots. If I were a Nazi - I'd be wondering where the rattlesnake went.  As I learned from WWE, don't turn your back on a rattlesnake.Aaaaand.... I have a new wallpaper vMexico declared war on the Axis Powers in support of the Allies on May 22, 1942, following losses of oil ships in the Gulf, most notably the Potrero del Llano and the Faja de Oro, to German submarine attacks. Although most American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and Brazil were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.

Perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the Mexican military was the Escuadrón 201, also known as the Aztec Eagles. This group consisted of more than 300 volunteers, who trained in the United States to fight against Japan. It was the first Mexican military unit trained for overseas combat.

""Kwame Ajamu, 56, was the last of three men exonerated in the 1975 robbery and murder of a Cleveland-area money order salesman. Ajamu was originally sentenced to death, but it was vacated because of a paperwork error. He later earned parole in 2003."" Only now being exonerated of all charges. 

The two other accused, Ajamu's brother, Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Ricky Jackson, 57, were released from prison last month after 39 years. 

Defense attorney Terry Gilbert said that Cuyahoga County prosecutors took a courageous stand not to fight the dismissal of charges against the men. Prosecutors also said they won't stop the trio from seeking more than $4.1 million in compensation from their wrongful imprisonments, reported Cleveland.com.

Jesus. That is a looooooong time. Even if I was guilty of a crime I don't know if I could stick it, but *27 years*. I think I'd try killing myself after the first decade.Wow. this doesnt make it better but atleast its not
Oklahoma and he's still alive How people can go through something like that without coming out the other end nearly insane and full of hatred and blood-lust for the pieces of shit that put them there, I don't understand. How can you have 27 years of your life taken from you, not to mention spending those 27 years years in a cage with human scum, and not want vengeance? Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from ToledoThe look on his face says it all. Obviously it's great that he was finally exonerated, but this picture makes me sad. You know in those 27 years he has missed so much of his life. No amount of money could fix it, but he deserves billions. I'm 25, he's been in prison longer than I've been alive. No idea if he has kids, but he definitely has(had?) parents. Imagine losing your family for 27 years. Not to mention everyone you know thinking you're a murderer. So so sad.You would be surprised how many innocent are locked up.The face of a man who has been tried.The look on his face says it all. That's 27 years of pain and anguish for a mistake that wasn't his.That man's face. Holy shitI'll point out the case of Ronald Cotton since it hasn't been mentioned yet. He only received $111,000 from the state of South Carolina after being wrongfully imprisoned for over a decade. His case also showed us a few things about handling witness testimony in law enforcement. Firstly, the victim of the crime had said she dedicated all of her effort during her rape to memorizing her attackers face; she identified cotton with certainty as her attacker, and he was exonerated by DNA evidence. Second, the investigators of her case made affirming statements to her following her indication of cotton as her rapist, causing her to believe her choice was the correct one. There were also inconsistencies in the investigation such as the line-up procedure that was used and an improper alibi given by cotton during his first interrogation being the only other piece of evidence used against him. CBS made a documentary about this story called [picking cotton](http://youtu.be/-2oDRfj0vME)source:

Poor guy. I believe he will be compensated handsomely for wrongful imprisonment though. Won't get him back all those wasted years or ease the pain of missing out on a lot of his life, but at least it should help him restart his life or depending on his age have a nice retirement. Ohio: 
$40,330 per year (or amount determined by state auditor) in addition to lost wages, costs, and attorney's fees. So a minimum of $1,088,910.Wouldn't be surprised if this was another case of false accusation from ""eye witnesses""Has anyone noticed the look on this mans face, or was everyone sidetracked by money talks?  The emotions being expressed here are so complex that just this millisecond snapshot of what he was feeling sent shivers through me.  I'm glad this man was released.  I can't even begin to imagine what sort of indignities this man suffered through for 27 years, but I'm sure no amount of money will ever compensate for it.  wow. Im 28, he spent pretty much all of my life in jail. Ive experienced to much wonder and wildness....all while he was locked up. My heart hurts for these peopleI went to a play called ""The Exonerated"" once about people who were locked up for crimes they didn't commit. People would be shocked and disgusted how often this happens. 

I can't even imagine how this guy feels. Imagine, when he went in it was the '80s. So much has changed and he's just been sitting in a cell. The people who go back and work on getting these people exonerated are really heroes. This is why we shouldn't have a death penalty. Think of all the guys that were extinguished instead of exonerated.That is truly upsetting. Can you even imagine? You did not do this thing, this terrible thing - murder - that they say you did. And then you go to jail for life. The thought that you are going to rot in jail forever for something you did not do. How quickly would you lose all hope? And then 27 years later, maybe after you've relinquished any and all thoughts of a life outside of prison, you come to find that you will be freed. 

All of the emotions he is experiencing, I cannot even fathom. I just want to give him a hug. 

This makes me want to be a lawyer and fight for people who are wrongfully imprisoned. No money can recover what that man lost. 27 years is about how long I've been alive. Think of all that time. He lost his chance at a career. At seeing the rise of the internet and tech. He lost his youth. He lost his reputation, his freedom. He probably lost himself. You don't spend nearly 3 decades in prison and not come out a different man. The system didn't take away 27 years of his life. The system took his soul. The system took everything that he ever was and ever could have been.

What's a million dollars to all of that?As a corrections officer, this is why I treat every person under my care as though they are innocent. Because some of them *are*.Sweater vest.

You wait a while and you see progress here and there. More discoveries are made about the nature of our universe. Machinery is sent to distant masses to search for signs of life.

* EDIT 7: Thanks /u/odh1412 for **[finding the RCW statute on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2refm0/employees_leave_a_protest_sign_at_failing_wet/cnf8n0u?context=3)**: http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.86.090

EDIT 2: Made local news, on a statewide news network. This means it WILL be on midday and evening news in all likelihood, and there's zero chance the state and local elected officials (including the state Attorney General and the City Attorney) won't hear about it: http://q13fox.com/2015/01/05/former-employees-reportedly-post-giant-sign-in-window-before-leaving-failing-seattle-wet-seal-store-photo/

EDIT 3: Contact page for the State Attorney General, for queries about wage theft: https://fortress.wa.gov/atg/formhandler/ago/ContactForm.aspx

~~EDIT 4: Contact page for the City of Seattle Attorney's office, for queries about non-payment/theft of sick leave, which by law employers must provide in our city since 2012: http://www.seattle.gov/law/contact.htm~~

* EDIT 6: Thank you /u/immortalbeloved for **[finding this, I was misinformed](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2refm0/employees_leave_a_protest_sign_at_failing_wet/cnf8dyo?context=3)**:

> **Are employees compensated for unused paid sick/safe leave when they leave their job?**

> No. An employer is not required to pay for unused paid sick/safe leave upon an employees
termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from employment.

(And that's a really shitty exemption in our local law that needs to be struck off)

EDIT 5: And international news: http://www.businessinsider.com/wet-seal-workers-leave-a-sign-2015-1My dad calls this store Moist Walrus.I love the Internet because 20 years ago companies could do shit like this without any consequences. Today, there's at least a chance the company will have to address this in order to avoid the negative publicity and backlash if the story gets out long term employee's without raises is extremely common unfortunately. I still work part time in retail, but only because I have been there since before a pay freeze. A lot of very hard workers trying to get by for $8 an hourWet Seal Dayton Mall, saw this yesterday
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/TH4OgCL.jpg)[Jan 2nd article on Wet Seal's financial situation - Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-02/wet-seal-says-it-received-default-notice-on-27-million-in-notes.html)  

Looking at yahoo finance, their stock price has been below $1 since September, meaning they will be delisted from the NASDAQ soon. Heading for a bankruptcy very soon.  
[Fly you fools](http://i.imgur.com/zCZLR1n.jpg)I work in one of the Wet Seal stores this is happening in and it's awful! Our sick time is not ""given"" to use, we have to accrue it like vacation days. My staff was given 24 hours notice before their last shift and my assistants and myself are having to work in the store by ourselves so corporate can avoid paying out extra money to associates. I also have an associate in my store who has been with me for over a month, her pay card was not activated by corporate and when we called about it we find out the lady in charge of that department had taken a vacation and literally tons of other girls were not receiving money on their pay cards either. This whole situation is crappy for all people on the bottom of the totem pole and I'm honestly just glad to be done with this company. Same story here in [North Carolina](http://imgur.com/j8b4jHn).  I know a store manager over there who has been told nothing but lies over the last month when questioning why their store wasn't receiving new inventory.  Classy company.  That's pretty fucked up. Not getting paid for your sick leave is par for the course... Most retail employees don't even get paid sick days. A $95,000 raise for the CEO is legitimately undetectable in terms of corporate cash flow. That being said, giving your employees one day to find a new job is absolutely awful. My girlfriend was a manager at Borders, the book store, when before they went bankrupt. The employees were strung along for quite some time, but eventually they came clean and said ""we're closing in 3 weeks, liquidate everything"". Most of the employees stayed during that time because it was pretty much the easiest retail job they could ever have for 3 weeks. ""What're they gonna do, fire me?""My partner works for H&M. He's a 5 year employee. He now has 5 weeks vacation, 14 days 'personal' time and healthcare for both of us (domestic partner insurance) that costs less that $50/month with a tiny deductible. I've worked for Apple, Samsung and Canon. I've never had benefits as good as he gets. 

Just chiming in to say retailers can do right by their people. as a stocky 30 year old male, I will be sure to never shop there again.From someone who is ignorant, why are so many Wet Seal stores closing?
Good for them. I have no idea what Wet Seal is but good for them. A month with no check, commendation to the person who didn't burn that building to the ground.Shitty ass corporations man. I worked at a pizza hut a few years back and they told us the store was going to eventually close, but never gave us a date. So I stroll into work one day and find the store locked, and closed signs all over it. Not even a call. Good riddance. 

I hope those poor employees find something else. A place where they aren't so much screwed over. They are lucky all the employees did is make a sign, and not just take turns shitting on the floor before walking outMy company's CEO got a $3mil raise last year while we were in financial hardship.Going to be a tough week for Wet Seal's social media team...if they even have jobs anymore.","{'Sadness': 0.055768, 'Emotional_Range': 0.777, 'Tentative': 0.215, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.037523, 'Analytical': 0.067, 'Conscientiousness': 0.204, 'Agreeableness': 0.591, 'Joy': 0.061465, 'Disgust': 0.084177, 'Extraversion': 0.455, 'Openness': 0.274, 'Anger': 0.968337}",{}

RIPCharb's (the guy on the right) latest published drawing on the magazine was [this](http://i.imgur.com/o7tTvAy.jpg?1), a very creepy coincidence. RIP

It says ""Still no terror attacks in France"" with the terrorist saying ""hang on, we still have until the end of January to give our new year wishes""It must be noted that Charlie Hebdo has always made fun of all religions, not only islam.Charb, one of the caricaturists killed today, said earlier, after receiving death threats from islamists: **""I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit. It perhaps sounds a bit pompous, but I prefer to die standing than living on my knees.""** Source: http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/charlie-hebdo-charb-cabu-wolinsky-et-tignous-morts-dans-la-fusillade-07-01-2015-1894661_23.php[Four cartoonists](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6v8_6WCQAIYRnq.jpg) are said to be dead: Charb, Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski.

This is not the first time Charlie Hebdo was the target of an attack (they were torched in 2011), but I never thought someone would go that hard on them. 

Dear God, these guys were awesome, they will be thoroughly missed.never give up!

humor is immortal!

http://i.imgur.com/xeoCHEM.jpgThat's terrible.
I'm french and I'm so sad.
The signification of this attack is very strong. They wounded freedom.
Four cartoonists, they killed an economist too, Bernard Maris, I listened him on national radio ""France Inter"" on the morning.
RIPThe sad thing is that many have hoped media around the world would publish the cartoons that led to this tragedy. But what has actually happened is media blurring the cartoons in fear. Example from the Telegraph in the UK: http://i.imgur.com/lwcqqrY.png

Edit: Full context on the page: http://i.imgur.com/eYKGcaw.pngThe cartoonists are Cabu and Charb, but other people have been killed too, including cartoonists Wolinski and Tignous.

Here are some of their work:

[Cabu](http://a54.idata.over-blog.com/3/88/02/15/2010-101112/charlie_hebdo_c_est_dur_d_etre_aime_par_des_cons_cabu.jpg) - Translation: *Mahomet overwhelmed by integrists* ; ""It's tough, being loved by such cunts""

[Charb](http://static.ladepeche.fr/content/media/image/zoom/2015/01/07/1714196-b6v30sgcuaai-ol.jpg) - Translation: *No terrorist attacks in France so far* ; ""Wait! We have 'til the end of January to present our wishes/resolutions...""

[Wolinski](http://a404.idata.over-blog.com/500x479/2/31/51/01/758/Wolinski.gif) - Translation: the sign reads *Attack claimed by far-right extremists* ; Policemen: ""Walk slower, or we'll have no choice but to arrest them!"" ; Perpetrators: ""Walk faster, or they'll have no choice but to arrest us!""  
NOTE: Wolinski did very few policital drawings compared to his peers and was mostly known for his drawings on sexual perversion. I selected this drawing because a) it's the only political one I could find and b) it's one of the few that aren't NSFW.

[Tignous](http://marcsuivre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/caricature-tignous-islam1.jpg) - Translation: Man: ""You ought to cover yourself!"" ; Woman: ""Do you want it in the gabber, my Hand of Fatima?""[this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Wolinski) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignous) also, apparently. RIPThey apparently yelled that they were avenging Mohammed. What kind of god or prophet needs vengeance from a comic? These attacks don't show people's strength of conviction, they show the weakness of their beliefs. No one has ever strapped a bomb to their chest because of their belief in quantum mechanics or group theory.Between the majority of media's decision not to show these artists' works uncensored, and Sony caving to North Korea's (partially successful) attempt to prevent the release of The Interview, I'm thoroughly disappointed in the way our culture has caved to the violent, threatening tactics of fanaticism. Free-thinking nations should not be shriveling up like this in the face of hatred and oppression of thought. What a shameful time we live in.Jesus fucking christ, it's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated. 

EDIT. I appreciate the gildings, but your money would be better served donating to [an intellectual freedom or human rights organization.](http://www.ifla.org/faife/links/intellectual-freedom-human-rights-organisations)[deleted]In response we should be spreading their cartoons like wildfire.For printing purposes:

(NSFW)Let's protest by drawing. Pick a day, they can't kill us all. 

Edit: Awesome thanks for the gold! I posted this in anger. It is not right what those gunmen have done. I haven't read all of your replies. Some of you mentioned that you shouldn't do something that will offend all Muslims. I disagree. No group and no person should be above satire. Side note: A connect-the-dots of ""TPM"" would be fun if it was directed at the proper websites. You know, I'm extremely liberal when it comes to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and open immigration, but even I think it's time for Europe to tell Muslim immigrants to assimilate or expatriate. You want to wear hijabs and preach in the street? Fine. Want to convert old, unused churches to mosques? Groovy, awesome way to preserve architecture. Want to offer Middle East studies and Arabic in schools? Capital idea! Want to hold open iftars? Save a slice of baklava for me. Want to issue death threats in public protests, carry out honor killings and establish sharia courts? Well have fun doing that in the stone age shitheaps where that nonsense still flies, but you can get right the fuck out of my civilized society if you're going to behave like an animal.Fuck that. I'm in tears. Sadness and anger boil inside.

Cabu (left) was an household name in France. Such a sweet, intelligent, strong guy. Participated in the children broadcasts we were all watching in the 80s. 

Let it be remembered that he lived and died as a hero of freedom.

Interesting.Note to self: find a desert map for Cities Skyline.Those look to be the upper middle class suburbs, they tend to be on the outskirts of Vegas away from the strip since they overlook the desert mountains. High schools get built onto empty dirt lots and homes surround the area. Unfortunately, most of these homes get built around the outer edges more and more each year with less and less people buying them out. I'm only 23 and most of my friends have been able to *buy* these homes at this age from how cheap they are. I'm a Vegas Native and I can safely say this is only a specific view of suburban Vegas life. I'd even say Vegas has many different kinds of suburban looks since the city keeps growing immensely every year.

*edit from mobile* so thanks to savvy Vegas friends below this has been identified as the Aliante portion of Vegas, which is definitely a way nicer suburb of Vegas. I didn't meant to imply that these homes are foreclosing, but lots of neighborhoods that look like this one nearby are affordable to younger folks like me. Looks like future mars.Nuketown[deleted]Made of ticky tacky.Question for those that have lived in Vegas.

 In my many trips to Vegas I've noticed that most of the neighborhoods have brick walls built around them, why is that?Reminds me of ""The Goldfinch"".  [deleted]Lots of comments from people saying Vegas sucks. I've been out here 10 years. It's fine. Every city sucks if you're looking for reasons for it to. It's just like any other place. Many of the complaints apply to any major city. Drivers suck, drug problems, crime, people are ""fake"" blah blah blah. I don't drink, do drugs, party, etc anymore. I have a decent career and life out here in this ""party town"". It's all about how you look at it. I think the desert is beautiful. Yeah, it gets hot as hell. It's a desert. We also don't have to shovel snow. This winter was cold for like a week in late December. Other than that, nothing more than a light jacket was ever needed. 

All of that being said, don't raise kids here unless you can put them in private school. Clark County schools are atrocious. Even if they graduate high school (~30% won't), the curriculum is so weak that they will still be at a disadvantage. Especially in an out of state university.

I have desert landscaping. Grass is dumb in the desert. Even outside of being a waste of water and contributing to the humidity, it just doesn't look right in the middle of the desert. I sure as shit don't want to be outside cutting the grass when it's 115 degrees out.This looks exactly like the homes in Las Ventura's in San Andreas in GTA: San Andreas.I live there. AMAI live in a similar neighborhood on the south west end of Las Vegas.  It's kind of nice and weird knowing that across the street there is literally nothing but desert for hundreds of miles.https://www.google.com/maps/@36.3090064,-115.1967351,1475m/data=!3m1!1e3

Ah, this picture reeks of corporate interests and government unwillingness to stand up against the corporations. Notice how the colour of the area outside the suburbs is faded, signifying the death throes of Mother Nature herself. The grey, uniform tops of the houses signify the victory of the corporate agenda and the defeat of the common person, who is now powerless to stop the overreach of the 1%.Looks just like my sim city. If you've got a good set of illegal binoculars, you can even see those dastardly fools over in Desert Bluffs.This is right next to Shadow Ridge High School. I bought my car from a guy near here.Reddit is weird. Space colonies are the future but trying to live in the desert is arrogant and unsustainable.Ahh a good case study for gridding in Cities Skyline.Honestly this does not look so bad.

I would rather grow up there than my own city.

Imagine being an 8-14 year old kid there with a giant desert behind your house to explore, build bike trails, jumps and just wander.

also there is an airport near on the bottom left corner to watch planes land and take off.

Then at 16 with a summer job and saving up allowances I'd get a small dirtbike to tour around in the desert.

Seriously, this place looks 10x better than growing up in other cities where you are locked in on 4 sides with shitty bylaws setup by old women city councilors.

Curiosity has an extendable arm that takes partially photos from different angles, a program puts those photos together and creates the final ""selfie"".

http://www.gyubar.comFor anyone in Shanghai it's near Shanxi Nan Lu stop. 

http://www.smartshanghai.com/venue/11731/flaskIt's like good times at Davey Wayne's in Hollywood. How I know how people feel when they see the TARDIS in the shows. I once went to a crazy place kind of like this.  Story time!

I was in Toronto, at some club.  I wasnt really feeling the vibe, but did my best to enjoy myself.  Club Mamba or something like that.  Anyway, after last call, I figured I might as well make the best of the dancefloor as the DJ was getting ready to finish up.  Some random dude came up to me and asked me if I was going to the after party.

He gave me a card with an adress on the back.  He told me to knock twice on the side door and keep my head down.  Seemed kind of sketchy, but I was in a very open and trusting mood and wasnt ready for the party to end.

I grabbed my buddies and headed to grab a cab.  The cabbie looked at the adress and asked"" Are you sure?  Thats in the commercial district.  Nothing is open there.""  I told him to go to the address anyway.  

Once arriving, the scene did not look like any sort of venue, so I was confused.  The address was for a small two story Realtor's office. I paid the cabbie and asked him to wait, but he waved me off with kind of a told you so gesture.

Not to be made a fool by my friends, I was still optimistic.  ""Just wait, he said side door man, just wait.""

So I walk into the alley and low and behold there a side door.  I knock twice, honestly not expected anything but knocked anyway.  After a moment of waiting I had all but given up, but just as I turned to my freinds, the door open and a large man grumbled "" Ten dollars in your hand, keep you head down, dont say a word and pay the lady at the door.""

Uhhhh k.  So we head down and all three of us were speechless without the warning.  I was still pretty skeptical however, because I could hear no bass line.  As we get to the bottom of the stairs, a very old asian lady is sitting on a stool, complete with an old school accounting visor.  She says ""10 dollar"" and we quietly hand over our money as per direction.  Behind her, a man, im not shitting you, turns around and opens a freaking giant vault door.  Door cracks and the most insane electo-bassline leaps out.

I walk into the MOST insane, underground, speak-easy rave den.  Open drug use, bar serving well past first call.  Easily one of the coolest situations I found myself in at the time.  

I dont remember much after that unfortunatley, but I remember getting to work around 10am, completely unfazed by the lack of sleep.
Just like Bodega Sneaker Boutique in BostonI could see a drunk guy at the wrong machine trying to find the door behind it ""come on, bar, I know you're back here somewhere.""No fatties allowed There a sub for places like this?See?

It wasnt as impressive as that pic as most of the tree's were like 6 to 10 feet tall, but they did have like 200k trees.

I did it as a summer job between uni terms and it was the best job ever. We used to just pile up a trailer with soil a couple of times a day, jump on the back and lie down (in the nice soft soil) until we got to the spot we were working at that day.

Then we'd work in the sun all day until home time, I loved it! Rainy days were a bit rubbish but its gona happen. Overall I would love to do it again.

I think that we still don't know a lot about them, we thought that they never fished or swam until the past years or so when they were caught spearing fish and raiding a fisherman's basket.

They basically said ""vaccines don't cause autism and here's why.  But here's why these people think they do and it's because of flaws we all possess.""

[Link here](http://youtu.be/Rzxr9FeZf1g) for interested.Hopefully our war on science will be just as effective as our war on drugs, terror and poverty.  In other words, after ten years, science will be stronger than ever before.Over 90% of people who have had vaccinations don't have autism = vaccinations must cure autism. Whats up with USA and it's war with everything. You guys should have war on war.A few months ago I was at a party and the topic of vaccinations came up (no idea how) and one woman in her thirties was adamant that vaccinations were terrible. Her explanation was ""money is the root of all evil. Vaccinations cost money."" 

So I asked if she'd ever had antibiotics and she said yes, plenty of times. She didn't see the problem. I've never understood how a person benefits from rejecting the Moon landing. I understand why people reject climate change (greed) or GM food (fear) but what is it about landing a man on the Moon that threatens a person?My nephew told me about this issue of NatGeo by saying: ""Did you know they are saying the Moon landing was fake?""

I was about to go into my short speech about the hoaxers, then he showed me the cover and I had to pause and fit together a new response. Basically, I just told him to read the article.

Point is, some people will look at this and say ""yeah! war on science! stupid scientists! about time we ended that war on Christmas and started fighting the true demons of this world. Greedy, lying scientists!""I read this article and it was great - but it struck me as a little pandering to their audience (kind of like OP is to us). Of course NatGeo readers are going to agree with the sentiment.I just wish they also had ""Homeopathy is working"" on there.Just a comment on the Moon Landing...

I always like to ask the person that is convinced the moon landing was fake... ""Which landing was fake?"". Nine times out of ten they had no idea Americas landed on the moon 6 times... lolThe most surprising/sad thing on the cover? ""March 2015""... It seems like we shouldn't be debating science when the cover displays a man on the moon from almost 50 years prior. [deleted][deleted]I did a masters in environmental policy and we spent a surprisingly large amount of time criticizing people on the left for their lack of scientific rigor.  It's amazing how quickly these arguments turn into emotional pleas instead of rational analysis. It's funny. When I learned about European history as a kid, I thought it was really, really dumb that people were so devout that they completely rejected science just because it threatened their religious beliefs.  I thought, man were people backwards back then!  They could've prevented so many problems and lived much better lives if they weren't like that!  Good thing I'm living in an era where people are much wiser!

Sadly, now that I'm older, I've begun to realize that although centuries and centuries have passed, not much has changed.  Our society constantly falls back towards certain ways of thinking and still fights science and progress at every turn.  We reap the benefits of modern technology and medicine, but have so little appreciation for it.  It's truly disappointing.How about something like ""The Wars on Wars."" 

Why the fuck does EVERYTHING have to be a war on *something* these days?

The war on women

The war on drugs

The war on Terror

The war on Science

The war on Gamers

The war on Men


Fuck all if someone, somewhere isn't winning and then blames it all on someone who believes the exact opposite of what you believe in. There's no more civil discourse anymore. One side always feels the *other* side is suddenly at war because they disagree. This shit is starting to seriously wear on me.

And another thing - stay the fuck off my lawn!

science is about asking questions and following evidence

Yet your picture is awesome.Did you base his size on how many pieces you could slice him into? Beautiful. That's a once in a lifetime photo.This is an incredibly beautiful photo, but I really hope that you, or anyone else for that matter, doesn't look down upon cropped or edited photos. For one, cropping isn't something you can *really* control on a camera, at least not in terms of aspect ratio. But aside from that, the *idea* behind a photo is much more important (to me anyway) than the initial capture.

Don't get me wrong, actually being able to capture exactly what you want in the original capture is incredible, but editing is arguably just as important, especially in an age where it's almost expected. What editing does is allow the actual concept and creativity to shine. And that comes **well** before the, for lack of a better term, ""lucky shot"". A truly perfect shot that is unedited is almost always due to at least *some* amount of luck. After all, some thing you just can **not** plan, and those things shouldn't be rewarded in any way other than intrigue (or admiration of dedication, in the cases where someone was committed to a specific thing until they got the perfect shot they were looking for).

I of course recognize that there are photos which can be planned (to a certain degree at least), and that planning will have an incredible effect when done right. But what I guess I'm trying to say is that a photograph's ""value"" shouldn't depreciate due to it being altered (in cases where the alteration is purposeful and warranted of course-- if you make a picture ""worse"" by making terrible edits then that should obviously depreciate it). Photos that are altered (heavily, lightly, or anywhere in between), while obviously having different connotations, should all be treated with the same legitimacy in my opinion. Otherwise it's like telling someone ""your piece would be awesome, if it wasn't for the fact that you used a medium that's generally easier to work with"". Success through difficulty increases value, but difficulty is far from the only aspect that matters most.Congrats on getting that shot. You were in the right place at the right time, and you definitely did not fuck it up.

So there is a cop who gets paid to watch strippers all day, and if one flashes her vagina to a 21 or over customer he writes her a ticket? Isn't there a better use of taxpayer money?[This is probably something like how this went down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miPzwBcPEg4)Isn't clearwater the town that is almost run by Sciengologists?I want to make sure that everyone in here knows that the police in Clearwater felt that it this was a public offense so great that they had to spend time and money sending in an undercover operative.

And then, arrest her, put her in to the criminal justice system; taking up more time and court expense...all to make sure they this woman didn't expose her vagina to someone in a place where such a thing is likely to happen.People are making jokes, but this woman was facing legal consequences because of dishonest testimony of police officers policing thought crime. 

It's serious and you should still be angry over this. Nothing has changed.There is no end to the ridiculously absurd nature of our culture.

I was 99.9% sure it was abandoned because it was quite a ways from water, only weighed about 1 1/2 lbs and we just had several storms roll through the area. Plus, it came up to me like it was too little to be afraid.

I scooped it up and brought it to an animal rescue. It was confirmed abandoned and they cared for her. 

I of course took lots of pictures of the little cutie that I put on my Facebook. I got to go to work the next day (OB/GYN office) and asked everyone  ""Have you seen my beaver?!""

Thank-you for your attention.I have a pet starling! I found him before he even had feathers. He fell out of his nest onto the concrete and was severely dehydrated, so I took him in and nurtured him back to health.  I've had him for about two years now. He's a great bird! Very intelligent. Very loud...He talks and whistles nonstop. He's whistling the Harry Potter theme song as I type this. Beautiful birds but fucking assholes. They steal anything even if a momma Robin is feeding her baby afucking starling steals that shit from them. They don't care. They're like the honey badgers who don't give a fuck and do what they want.   I have two bird houses for tiny birds. You would think the starlings would be cool and leave it alone.  Fuck no! They pecked the shit out of the holes to make them bigger so they can fit their fat asses in there. Yeah beautiful but assholes.[deleted]Its amazing to think that the iridescence of these animals is derived not from any pigment, but from the structure of the feathers themselves. Microstructures in the feathers interfere with light waves in such a way as to create color where none existed before. Fascinating. Fun fact: starlings, a massively invasive species that cause >$800 million in crop damages per year and once caused a fiery plane crash, are only in the United States because of a single 19th century Shakespeare fanatic.

Long story short: the guy's name was Eugene Schieffelin and he was so obsessed with Shakespeare in the late 1800s that he decided to take every bird mentioned in his plays and introduce them in the United States. Of course, this was before people understood why introducing a new species into a foreign area might be problematic. The Bard mentioned starlings just once -- in Act I, Scene 3 of Henry IV -- but that was enough for Schieffelin.

Nowadays, starlings are a massive invasive species in North America, with numbers in excess of 200 million. They cause massive crop damage, spread disease, kill other birds, and occasionally bring down a jet.

Very interesting photo. Not least because of the painting the woman is 
looking at. That is a self-portrait of Rembrandt in old age. Rembrandt painted dozens of self-portraits throughout his life (partly because he couldn't afford models) and he is very severe and unforgiving as he records the aging process. We see in his face the life he lived, the joys and the disappointments. It is a very instructive choice for the viewer, who will see different nuances and meanings as they themselves age and their strength declines. I can understand why this person wanted to see this painting as she nears the end of her journey. It is clear she lived her life thoughtfully. May her loved ones take comfort in the memories.
the rijksmuseum and the scheepvaartmuseum are worth a week of your life. Do it.I completely respect that. I want to die with my favorite songs in my ears.I visited the Rijksmuseum in my early 20s.   Needless to say the trip is a bit of a blur, but I remember being blown away by the how much more realistic Rembrandt's works were compared to his contemporaries.   But I digress...I'm glad the woman in this picture was able to enjoy the beautiful pieces one last time.This is really beautiful. Just hidden behind the lady in the bed is a bald elderly man holding a bag, standing next to her. Although a bit of an assumption, if that is her husband it's nice that they get to enjoy it together. Thanks for posting and referencing. I visited Rijksmuseum not too long ago and had a great time. Was impressed by the [The Night Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch). Also, dutch people are cool.As a German I always knew it: Dutch people are the better GermansI went to the Rijksmuseum last week to see the Late Rembrandt exhibition. It was busy in the exhibition but well worth it to see a fantastic selection of Rembrandts from all over the world in one place. It's on until May 17th.Reminds me of Shawshank Redemption where Andy says ""That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you."" [deleted]Damn, that's powerful.This is so sad it's beautiful.Such a beautiful museum too!

My favorite painting is [The Night's Watch.](http://www.led-professional.com/project_news/art-museum-lighting/philips-sheds-new-light-on-night-watch-at-the-rijksmuseum/the-new-led-lights-protects-environment-and-art/image_richdoc_big)[deleted]That particular Rembrandt self portrait used to be at the Kenwood House in Hampstead, London. I know because I've visited it twice. I wonder when it was moved (back?) to Rijks. I didn't see it this past January when I was in Amsterdam. I wasn't aware this organization existed. That's REALLY cool. Looks like we've got it in Belgium as well. It's oriented specifically towards non-mobile palliative care patients and, unlike Make-a-Wish, it's not age-specific.

Thanks for sharing, OP :)

*obligatory edit*: first gilded comment, someone catch me if I swoon.Almost looks like one of those log ridesThis seems like an engineering issue.Photo credit: Dan Slack - Folsom, CAI work for the mechanical department of Union Pacific and this level of water is usually not a problem. Like someone else mentioned in the comments only the flange of the wheels will actually be in contact with the water.
Its only an issue when there is 3+ inches of water of submersion of the rails. Reason being is that the water splashes into the electrical motors that run the wheels and causes them to short out. (Locomotives are diesel series hybrids, i.e diesel engine powers a generator which in turn powers electrical motors located at the wheels.)

Other issues with flash floods is sometimes the foundation of the rails gets shifted causing massive derails on our systems, we usually tell our trains to slow down over rails submerged like this.FUN FACT!

Back when high speed steam powered express trains were a thing they had track pans that went in between the rails.  Since water was the type of fuel that was mostly used and that ran out first, they would be making several stops to refill on water.  Their solution was a chute at the bottom of the tender that would blow gallons into the tender from going across a track pan.  Express train ranges and speeds were greatly increased thanks to this cool little invention.  [Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/LNWR_Ramsbottom_Water_Troughs_1904_edited-2.jpg) is a picture of track pans being put into use on the LNWR (London & Northwestern) a british railway.

That`s the so-called ""gun that won the west"" and was a super quick cycling rifle due to the toggle-link design.  It had a neat little cover on the top that you could slide over the action to protect it from rain and snow.

That's the gun that's **supposed** to be used in Westerns, the one that would be period correct.  However, in most westerns, including John Wayne movies, the anachronistic Winchester 1892 was used instead, due to availability and I guess it looked more pleasing.  

I'm betting that one is chambered in .44-40.  The gun design was replaced by the 1892 (in you guessed it, 1892) by gun inventor John Moses Browning.  The 1892 never could cycle as fast as the 1873 but it was much stronger with two giant steel lugs that locked into the receiver.  

I have two modern reproduction 1892 rifles in .44 magnum.  Today there are 1873 replicas (made by Uberti in Italy and Miroku of Japan licensed by Winchester).  Compared to other lever guns, they're not strong due to the toggle-link design not having very positive lock-up.  But they're quick so they're used with great success in cowboy-action shooting.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! :)
> How long it's been there is unknown.

I bet a billion dollars it's been there less than 133 years.Was a broken tombstone next to it? How about a black and white photo of a blank grave?some rogue probably laid his weapon down there before meeting his maker 130 years ago[deleted]Maybe this is Rockstar doing some very creative marketing for the sequel to Red Dead Redemption. What if it still worked? Imagine what an advertisement for Winchester that would be.He probably went to grab a pint but things didn't just blow overNice little article about it in the Washington Post this morning. I can see the rifle being there for a very long time, especially with the canopy of the tree offering shelter from the elements.

It is a 44-40. Found unloaded leaning against a juniper tree as they were doing some ""what is out here?"" archaeology work.

Juniper have some interesting traits. Whole limbs can die while the rest of tree is fine. The wood can last a very long time in the arid inter-mountain west. Beams found at various ruins have been dated to hundreds of years old using dendrochronology. The amount of wood rot for the butt and stock is really impressive...

OP: What's the back story? Did you find this? If so, where? Have you contacted the local historical society?  
And to quote Dr. Jones: It belongs in a museum.If evolution is real, why hasn't it evolved into a tank yet?That would be so cool if the roots grew around the trigger, and 132 years later it somehow still worked and right as you took this picture it shot youI bet some guy for the longest time was like ""where the fuck is my rifle""Stuff like this gives me chills.  

Assuming that rifle has been leaning against that tree all these years, that means things like the Titanic hadn't even been built yet.  All of WWI and WWII happened, the rise and fall of Hitler.  Hell, atomic tests were happening in Nevada while that rifle ever rested against that tree.  Think of the many days/nights/seasons it sat through.  

Jesse, I done lost my rahful.It almost blends in with the tree!I like to think that years ago some bandit decided he was going to hold up a carriage passing through and hid loaded up weapons around the heist area so he could ride to the nearest one rather than trying to reload his weapons on horse back. Unfortunately the west is a cruel mistress and he was gunned down that day. With it's owner gone, the Winchester stood in wait for it's time to come. 130 years later, battered and aged, it's found.Nevada Native here.

We've been doing this since far before I was born with items made since before the 1900's.

I instantly panicked thinking someone found our tree and was going to remove our things, but this isn't the case.Someone needs to ID the tree and see what its growth is like over 132 years. It doesn't seem to be that big and I doubt it's been that size for over 100 years. ""I, Hatchet Jack, being of sound mind and broke legs, do leaveth my rifle to the next thing who finds it, Lord hope he be a white man. It is a good rifle, and kilt the bear that kilt me. Anyway, I am dead. Sincerely, Hatchet Jack.""Plot twist, Forrest Fenn hid all the treasure in tiny increments. Actually its not bad, if his goal was to get people out doors, a bunch of tiny caches would be more mobilizing than one big one...but maybe I just have treasure on the brain.You know how old people tell you all the time about ""back in my day we respected our stuff more"".

But it's so close the handlebars would probably hit the sign. What is this sorcery?! Ok I figured it out guys, the sign says ""No Motorcycle Snowmobiling Allowed"". 

Edit: According to my inbox a lot of people don't like my humor. Yes guys I get that the sign came later and the ruts were likely from a vehicle that knocked down the original sign. Also there are probably only two ruts because the car was rear wheel drive and the front tires didn't leave marks whereas the rear tires were spinning out. The tracks are old indentations in the mud. Sign came later. Dr. Biiishop, the parallel universe is leaking over agaaain!The truck that carried the workers that installed the sign pulled into the grass and the workers put the sign up and pulled back into the road.

We start and there is no sign post there, but the base bracket has been installed in the ground, waiting for the sign post. They pull in, roll over the bracket in the ground and stop just after the truck clears it. 

Some dude standing on the back of the pick-up slides the new sign onto the bracket, and the truck pulls away. He may or may not even bother with bolts to attach it or if they are fancy-schmancy, they may have clips inside which lock into place.

Look at the tracks and they are a little straighter just the other side of the sign post. That's where the truck stopped. 

The bracket might be like the one in the picture I provided above, or the piece installed in the ground may go inside the sign post itself, or there may be not a bracket, just a square hole in concrete. Those tracks are from a a sign pole installing machine. Just doing their jobs. There is no sign.Fringe event!Maybe the sign was put there after the vehicle drove through Inspector gadget? Damnit Walter, wasn't Peter enough??Get the Fringe Division on this and have them report back to me. -Broyles This grass is probably super thick or was wet when it was driven over.

He was 26 when he worked on David. TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD. AND he won the contract to work on David over Da Vinci. What a bad motherfucker. I went with a tour guide to see this and was told the hands and head were made larger than they should be because it was supposed to be on top of a building and they wanted the proportions to be correct from a distance. In the end it was too heavy for the roof to support so ended up on the ground, and looking a bit out of proportion. [deleted]And i can't even draw a Simpson's hand.

FFS.

Edit: yes i did mean one Simpson. the apostrophe is correct in this context.I wonder how people groomed their nails in olden days.Another fantastic of marble work:
http://viola.bz/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/statue-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-Mary-in-marble-by-Strazza.jpgMichelangelo was around 28 when he sculpted David. please, correct me if Im wrong. I make wood sculptures for a living and can't fathom working with stone like this. One bad chip with a chisel and the piece could be ruined. The patience and artistic ability of these people blows my mind especially since the technology and tools they had is incomparable to today's.It was an incredible moment to turn into the hallway and see the David at the end of the corridor.  The light was shining down upon the statue and I'm not sure I've ever seen anything so beautiful.  As I got closer, to see the detail was really astonishing.  If you get the opportunity to see this awesome work of art, I would highly recommend it!I've spent hours examining the details on his scrotum. Hours. Is this acceptable proof that my throbbing metacarpus vein is not in fact 'weird and scary' It's the look on his face that gets me.  That the mind is our ultimate weapon, no matter how outmatched we are in physical strength.

The whole statue is unbelievably beautiful, though.Does anyone know if the middle finger was broken off? There seems to be a line along the joint, like it's been attached. I was always impressed by the draped marble cloth in this piece at Windsor. The curtains are marble too. http://i.imgur.com/6JaHD5B.jpgPoo fingers That's a lot of detail. This guy should be famous. Are their veins in... anything else? Michelangelo always thought that the figures were trapped in the carrara marble, and all he did was just free them from their marble prison.The first time I saw the David, I wasn't aware that I was walking toward it and was looking on either side instead. Suddenly, I had to stop because I was face-to-foot with David. The detail in the feet immediately blew me away. I think I stared at his feet for a solid 10 minutes before I started looking at the rest of the statue. The entire detail is amazing and to know that a teenage worked on it is astounding. http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/jhm/arch/david/David.htm

I'm pretty sure this was posted on here before, but it's worth reposting for those who haven't seen it. Apparently the current orientation of the statue is incorrect from how it was intended to be viewed. It has a much more intense feel to it when viewed from this perspective. It helps to put it into the context of David's battle with Goliath. I got to go to Italy some years ago and see it in person. I wasn't aware of this before hand but it wouldn't have mattered too much since this article says there's a pillar blocking the view to this angle.  When seeing David in-person it's impressive how big the statue is. It's 14 feet tall without the stand. For some reason I always thought David was just normal size. Pictures in a book don't begin to do it justice. David is blow-you-away impressive!Pieta is one of my favorite sculptors of his.

This is how Americans cue for the train:

http://i.imgur.com/T0K6Ep2.pngI've seen similar on the Beijing subway. That is until some people just walk straight to the front and start pushing those queuing suckers to the side.

We have a similar issue here in the Philippines, so called VIP drivers who think they're the most important person on the road. Imagine a 4 lane road, 2 going one way and 2 going the other. 2 lanes are full of cars queuing, waiting for the light to turn green. The VIP driver will simply travel the wrong way down one of the other lanes and drive straight to the front of the queue, often causing more traffic on the other side by driving down it the wrong way. It's the most frustrating thing ever when you miss the lights by 1 car because that idiot jumped the queue. And here's [Caracas, Venezuela](https://youtu.be/t5M3hUDHQfE) EDIT: to be fair isn't always that way, here's [another example](https://youtu.be/IrHx5oEMcWI)Here are two more queuing examples in Japan:

For a comic convention: https://youtu.be/ermNqkUUiJwToday on reddit: Fuck China.Some busier platforms like Shinjuku have separate sides for getting on and off, making it the most efficient system ever even during rush hour. Not sure if other major metro lines have this but I thought it was really neat. Get in a proper line like they do in India.  Ass to penis and no room between or you are not in line.

I have a very close japanese friend that explained me they are educated like this from the very beginning at home and at school.

They are taught that the country has very limited resources, so everybody must cooperate in order for them to survive and improve their quality of life. When you see somebody using a mask in in the streets it's because that person is sick and she doesn't want to spread it any further.To be fair, I saw the same thing happen in Shenzhen.How have we not adapted this technique in the USA? I live in a small town but my public transit experiences in my visits to NYC/DC/Boston could be described by the phrase 'free-for-all'The idea of the queue is one of the greatest successes of civilization.A strange phenomena I observed while visiting China was that ppl will stand in a perfect queue waiting for the bus. However, at the moment the bus appears, they will leave the queue and storm to the bus. Confusing times. I must have trust issues because I would never stand out front because I fear someone might push me onto the tracksHave lived in Nagoya for ~7 years now.  Pretty much normal.  I don't think the U.S. is much worse though, in Japan they make markers on the floor and such usually to help form the line.  I have never seen tape marking lines or anything back stateside... so it doesn't drive people to line up as much.

""Treetops Resort manager Barry Owens said the students were escorted from the premises by Michigan State Police last weekend after causing $50,000 in damage. The resort is in Dover Township near Gaylord.

""Owens said Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity members caused significant damage to furniture, carpet, walls and ceilings.""Pretty good. Here in the UK, I believe it was Manchester University, were in a pretty cheap ski resort. The rooms were too small to host a party and the walls were extremely thin. They put two and two together and knocked down the walls for 4 connecting rooms.

It was like living in a fucking house full of testosterone-addled chimpanzees with cell phones.I didn't realize Michigan was now accepting tornadoes as students. ITT: we find out that most of Reddit is private contractors who could fix up the place for under $1k> Sigma Alpha Mu President Joshua Kaplan emailed a written apology.

[source](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/01/21/university-michigan-fraternity-members-accused-resort-vandalism/22116999/)I worked at a resort where a man ran a bath for himself while drunk.  On the 4th floor then passed out in his room.  The flooded hotel was discovered by a guest on the 1st floor.  

We ran up, floor after floor opening rooms trying to find the source of the water til we made it to the 4th.  After banging on the door, we opened it to find a naked man just inside the door, passed out on the floor, and the bathroom tub running full blast and water everywhere.

He was there on his companies dime ($74,000 in damage and lost revenue).  It didn't end well for him.

edit: evidently people dont understand what overflow's on tubs, and the plumbing behind it is designed for.  look it up people.  it's not designed for tubs on full blast for hours, its designed to help you save your ass because you lost a second or two while filling, and or someone is splashing around in a full tub...ffs.  and the insults?  really?

Starring Emma Watson in the lead role maybe..This her explaining how the software was smart enough to recognize there was an error causing a lot of CPU load during the lunar descent and saved the mission by choosing to work on more important tasks and ignore these errors.  Kind of amazing that this code reacted more intelligently to failure than most modern systems:

Due to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful [M]oon landing it was.""

One accidental nudge and she'd have a whole new perspective on a stack overflow./r/gentlemanboners That's a lot of code.  Even in assembler or Fortran (really the two most likely possibilities), that's still a lot of code.  I presume she's NOT the only programmer.

I'm gonna do a wild estimate.  I'm gonna say she's 5'8"" / 175 cm, and that stack is exactly as high.  I happen to have a thing of 500 sheets of paper here which coincidentally is exactly 5cm thick.   Meaning that could be 17,500 pages.  I doubt it's that tight so lets round down to 15,000 pages.    Lets drop that even more because of binding, pages that aren't 100% full, and so on.  12,000 pages (20% drop).  Now lets assume 20 lines per page (it's probably printed landscape).  So it weighs in at about 240,000 lines of code.

anybody got any way for us to check that?
what I like about this image is that she's obviously proud, but not necessarily because of the recognition she's getting.  she's not posing as a boast the way most people do this kind of shot, like ""look how big my &ldquo;code&rdquo; is.""  instead she looks genuinely thrilled about the work and what it represents.  the commemorative aspects are secondary to the fulfillment of the task itself.Wish women like this were role models, not that twat kardashian..This looks like the person, also named Margret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West in ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1939. Maybe a daughter or grand-daughter.My grandfather worked with her on the apollo code, I was always interested in Space and they were one of the reasons why. Telling me about the women that did these amazing things and that if I worked hard enough I could do so much too. My grandfather had a ton of careers and about has his life spent getting all sorts of degrees, I was always so curious why on earth he would walk away from a program like this, he just said he wanted to do something else. Take note, Mattel. [deleted]That isn't code.  In the video they infer that this is the output of a botched program.

The glyphs of clock hands at the respective hour for the clock hands are in the places which tell you the hands are in a particular place.

Or in simpler terms, the glyphs themselves show where the hour points are regardless of what they look like.

As such, they're not completely useless.

If they weren't there and the clock was rotated by an unknown number of degrees it would be impossible to tell the time or the orientation of the clock.

In that sense, the glyphs are slightly better than dots in those positions.

Edit: Constructive criticism aside, I like this clock. I'd consider it if I was looking to buy a wall clock.Is it 12 or 6? I am so confused![deleted]You are reading this sentence.

It was so bizarre, because it is *huge* -- utterly towers over the town which has no other tall buildings.  The facility was fully staffed, maintained, and everything -- but practically deserted.
 
They operated a club lounge, including an attendant, apparently for me alone as I never saw another person there.  The lobby bar had like three people (and substantially more employees) at peak time.

Australia is quite the place.I used to be a snake and lizard breeder and was given one of these rhino beetles by an invert collecting friend, scared the life out of me the first time it took flight, the noise was immense.That wasn't a hiss, it was a ""Pssst, hey buddy, be a pal and get some some sugar water!""

I lived there for 3 months in grad school, and it was amazing. In the winter you can rent skis downtown, walk to the train station, and with one (maybe two) train connections you're in the middle of the alps, passing up through Wengen, on your way to skiing. Not to mention lazing around in the crystal clear glacier-fed river in summer, and the amazing hikes in the alps that you can do in the non-winter months.

Alas, the country really dislikes foreigners and there's a huge amount of xenophobia (colleagues of Iranian and Indian descent were given dirty looks on a regular basis). Can't have it all...

This is just a misshaped tiny house. I don't understand how a house that looks like that from the outside can properly utilize all of the space within. In Japan the resale value of houses is virtually nothing. When Japanese buy a house they want it to be a new house. Even people who don't want to move will demolish their houses after 30 years and then rebuild them. 

From an economics POV, this is incredibly inefficient. It is a massive misallocation of capital and resources that is justified on the basis of how much work it provides to construction companies and architects. But it's just the Broken Window Fallacy at work on a huge scale.

But the positive side of this is that when Japanese have houses built they are often very unique, quirky reflections of the individual owner's personality. The question ""How would it affect the re-sale value of this place if I do *that*?"" is simply never asked or considered.I almost feel like they bought a car and then decided to just build a house around it, just 'cause.Reminded me of this building in Portugal.

Here is a [handy chart](http://i.imgur.com/gu7MeTU.jpg).

The colors are formed during permineralization and petrification when minerals invade and replace organic parts of the plant. 

Depending on what minerals are in the environment/water and how much oxygen such minerals are exposed to. 

In oxygen depleted environments minerals might come into contact with oxygen inside the tree, the reds are formed by iron oxides forming hematite. 

Other minerals in the environment like sulfides from decaying matter and manganese and all the other things in the chart leech into the log and form these colorful stones.There is no way this is a white oak. Angiosperms (e.g. oak trees), didn't evolve until around 100 million years ago, putting the Petrified Forest at about 125 million years older than the first oak tree.

This means it is likely a gymnosperm, or a conifer. Based on the remains of the bark, I would say there's a much better chance this is an ancestor to the Sequoia, which first appeared around 150-200 million years ago.

I always wanted to go to the museum of lapidary art, but for some reason once was enough for my parents.  Even my grandparents wouldn't take me.  Well many years later, I was driving across the US and stopped for gas at the Petrified Forest where - holy shit - you could *buy petrified wood*.

It's nice finding stuff like this, my sister bought a $70,000 house with plans to fix it up and sell it. There was ugly worn out shag carpet in the living room, she pulled it up and found hardwood floor in good condition, got it refinished for like $1500 and it looks amazing now. from the thumbnail, i thought you were putting a border or something, and made it look like a chart, where the stock market crashed.

Will my kids be watching house hunters 30 years from now wondering why the hell people in 2015 liked the open concept and granite countertops?

I can see the property brothers telling them no problem...we can just add a couple of walls and close this place right upAhh, the joy of home remodeling.  You never know what you're gonna find under that first layer of flooring or wall.  All you do know is, it's not gonna be level & it's not gonna be square.
Pull up the hexagon tiles to take a glimpse into what next year's trends will beYou should tear up the hardwood and see if there's carpet underneath. Your bathroom has progressed from Civ4 to Civ5.It took you an hour to see those?Whatever you do, don't forget to seal it. The thumbnail looks like the 1920's stock market.Congrats. My parents house has original 1920 bathrooms (don't ask) and those tiles, which are now 95 years old and have had more heavy wear that you can IMAGINE are still perfect. 95 years old. Only take up half. So you can play DnD on half and Warhammer on the other half.The 1920's hex tile was probably set into a thick mud layer, which was common at the time, and can be a pain to take out (or so I've heard from people who've had to pull up these floors) so a lot of people just tile right over them instead of bothering with pulling up the old floor.  Hope you find all your original tile in good shape, glad you're working on restoring part of the house to it's original look (I have a thing for houses of the 20's and 30's). Please post finished project. 
We also have a 90 year old house and gutted the bathroom.  The bathroom was a bad 1970s job and nothing original was left.  We had the same idea as you and chose hex tiles, but we found some marble mosaic ones with black stone interlay and did charcoal grout.  After seeing how disgusting the floor and white grout was before, I did charcoal grout in the whole bathroom - in the subway tile shower too (another Nicole Curtis shoutout there!)  Hope the floor works out for you.How did you get the new tile under the old? You should have your own dyi channel.In the 1920s:

The basic story is that he was fighting in the Genji-Heike wars, on the Genji side; he and his unit were being taunted by enemies far out to sea to shoot down a fan target they were flying, the idea being he and his friends would waste their arrows on it. Nasu was the best archer with them and was ordered by the unit commander to shoot the target down despite the distance, high waves, and strong winds, so he rode out into the sea, and prayed to the kami (gods/spirits) that he would hit. When he opened his eyes after praying, there was a break in the wind and the waves were momentarily calm; he took the shot and scored, completely detaching it from the enemy ship. There's quite a long discussion of the story in Yukio Mishima's selections from the Hagakure (I don't remember if it's his commentary or original) about how he should have died right after, either in battle or by suicide, because that was the highpoint of his martial valour. Anyone interested can find this in chapter 11 section 4 of The Tale of the Heike.

As an Air Force boom operator, I only got to refuel these things one time. Before the flight, the crew chief got a maintenance stand and a tub of Vaseline. He then proceeded to lube up the end of our boom nozzle. Watching him wax our pole was funny as Hell.

Seriously though, that was the hardest contact I've ever made. The receptacle was barely any larger than the nozzle, and there is no slipway. Talk about adrenaline inducing.Don't know if it's true but I was told this was the first American jet capable of sustained vertical acceleration.


>An F-4 pilot requested clearance to take off from a joint military/civilian airport, but due to the amount of civilian traffic the ATC told him hed have to hold.
After a repeated impatient request by the F-4 to take-off the ATC suggested that if the pilot could reach 14,000ft within half the runway length he could take off; otherwise he would have to hold.
To the ATCs surprise the F-4 pilot acknowledged the tower and began to roll. At the halfway mark the F-4 went vertically up until he reached 14,000ft, then levelled off.
The ATC had no option than to hand the pilot over to departures and wish him a nice day, since hed met the conditions laid [Calvin's take on the Phantom](http://imgur.com/4moDe9W)[Here ya go!](http://i.imgur.com/SNPq27V.jpg)Is there a T-Rex flying it?Still my favorite jet.

Grandpa stories come alive.This was my favorite jet to use in Air Combat on PS1 I'm a multi-generational military brat. In the late 70's I lived at MCAS El Toro in southern California. I used to get to see these all the time. We lived near the back of base housing and a few times they hit after burners near our house. We had a window break that way once.I was fortunate to have been in the Army during the F4 era.

One time at Ft. Bragg circa October 1973 we were doing some sort of firepower demonstration out at a place I seem to recall as OP-5. There were numerous displays of artillery batteries letting loose with what they had: high explosive, white phosphorous, smoke, illumination rounds, timed fuses, etc.  I mean, every artillery battery on Fort Bragg was participating: 105mm, 155mm, 8 inch...there might have even been some 175mm.

The thing began with some massive time on target display in which every single gun fired in such a manner that all rounds hit the impact area *simultaneously!* Just before they all hit, an arc of white phosphorous rounds went off in the air a tenth of a second apart (or something like that), providing a visual clue of where to train the eye. Then...*KA-BOOM*...as hundreds of artillery rounds hit the impact area at once.

Anyway, for as impressive as that was, it absolutely paled compared to the F4 demo at the end. 

Sitting on the bleachers looking down range, there was a tree line off to the right. The announcer directed the audience to look over to the trees.

Two F4 flying just above tree-top level came flying in *faster than the speed of sound.* So you didn't hear them coming! In silence, two F4s came flashing out from above the tree line, and in silence they flew directly over and in front of the bleachers. It was eerie. Then about half a second later -- **KA-FUCKING-BOOM!** -- followed immediately by the sounds of four jet engines roaring in all their force and fury.

It was awesome, simply awesome.

The point of the hybrid here is not to be green, efficient and economic.

Awesome.I made a whole album of this thing a while ago here:
http://imgur.com/a/cHP46I was 13 years old, summer of 1997. I had an assignment over the next 3 months to complete the 8th grade Bug Collection. 

First I researched what insects I wanted to find, because there was no way I was going to have to cliche ant and wasps in my foam board display box. No. Way. 

I saw pictures of many insects from all over the country. Two stuck out to me: the Golden Tortoise Beetle and the Gladiator Katydid. I had to have these! I researched their diet, call, and range where they lived. 

I caught many neat bugs in my collection. Assassin bugs, a Cecropia Moth, a Metallic Green Bee, and a Tiger Beetle--it is faster than a Cheeah, but has to stop a lot because it runs so fast it blinds itself. But I couldn't find the two elusive insects that I admired so much. 

Then, one day, I was sitting on my parents' back porch. I heard a call. 'Click click clclclclclclclclclclclclcllclclclcick, click click click clclclclclclclclclclclclcllclclclcick'

I rushed to get my bug net. Although I've never seen a Gladiator Katydid, I researched the hell out of it, and I knew what that sound was!

I hunted my prey with soft feet and steady movements. I could hear the call getting louder. I over turned leaves, one by one, ever so delicately. 

And there it was!

I carefully surrounded the leaf my treasure was perched on, and scooped him up. 

Bam. Gladiator Katydid in my collection. 

Later that day I was walking around my parents' garden, and on a large leaf I saw some sort of insect, just chillin'.  I got closer to identify it. Holy Shit! It was a Tortoise Beetle!!!

I ran to get my bug net, and thankfully the little guy stayed put! 

BAM. Golden Tortoise Beetle, in my bug collection!!!

Best. Day. Ever. 

I started College in 2002, and I wanted to persue a degree in Entomology. Instead I joined the Army. 

I'll never forget the rush I got when I caught those two insects though!> as larvae, they protect themselves by sticking old skin and faecal matter to their anal forks  otherwise known as faecal parasolsIf you had said it was a broach, I would have believed it. Too bad the Nooks only pay 50 bells for this bitch. I love mammals and all the wonderful furry critters on this earth, but I think insects are vastly underrated by most people. All of the variation seen in arthropods stuns me. Just look at that beetle, it is colored shinny gold, partial translucent, and it can fly! We are lucky to have a world teaming with life.This makes me think of ""The Gold Bug"" by Edgar Allen Poe. What an awesome short story. Treasure, secret codes, adventure, racism... it has it all.I find these alot in/around pools during the summer. Guess theyre trying to get some water.It's a shiny!
throws pokeballThis looks fake but long ago I realized nature can produce things beyond imagination.Evolution in action right here.

Bird: *Look at that yummy black beetle, I think I'll have it for breakfast.*

Beetle: *Noooo! You asshole! You're eating my insides!*

Beetle's family: *So um, we really have to do something about this, and I have an idea. You ever see those bugs that disguise themselves as sticks? Well, birds don't eat them as much. So, what else don't birds eat? FUCKING TORTOISES! Let's disguise ourselves as tortoises.*

Flawless plan here.Looks like it engaged it's shields. Fucking riot shields. How many bells is that worthi swear this is posted about four times a yearLife art imitating lifeI wonder how they came up with the name?Imagine if that finger was really an arm that the bug is sitting on. Looks like done magic might come out of him.It's Da Vinci's long lost Vitruvian Beetle!But does it have a battle axe for a dick?If I found this in nature, I would have totally thought I found a new species.Shut your god damn mouth is that thing real?

Now with financial implications to its business maybe Disney will commission a new movie to encourage vaccination? Tentatively titled ""Princess and the Jab""GG Jenny McCarthyPretty measly queue.Don't thank measles, thank the fools who don't immunize their children. 1 in 5000 children die from complications from measles. Pregnancies miscarry or have birth defects when mothers pick up Rubella and Mumps can lead to viral meningitis. Idiots don't immunize with MMR. Epidemics and deaths will come. Only very very very few specially diagnosed ppl should not get vaccinated.I don't understand this post. Is there a measles outbreak? Does OP currently have measles and as such people are avoiding him?

Context please.We went to Disney World one year during the week before Halloween. Temp was upper 70s. Short lines. Read a book by Fodors that suggested what was the best time to catch a show, best place to stand to see the parades, best vantage point to see the fireworks, best time to see the animals being active. ""Disney With Kids"" was the title, or something close to that. Our kids ended up being chosen to participate in the Lion King Show, Main Street Parade, and one other show that I can't now remember (10 years ago).

Do your research and save time, money, and energy. And see more in one visit than you would by just wondering and backtrackin all dayProbably not even the Measles. It's off season, so the usual big crowd at Disneyland isn't there.

 I went back in 2010 with the high school Band. We got complementary tickets since we were marching in one of their parades, and we could choose the day to go. We choose to go the Thursday the week before presidents day, because since we had Friday off from school, we essentially had a 4 day weekend. 

Also, since it was a Thursday In February, Disneyland was a ghost town compared to other days. Every ride had a wait time of 10 minutes or less. It was awesome. 

Although the Measles outbreak probably did help a bit.The Haunted mansion is closed right now at Disneyland... This may seem a tad dark for some people. But in December of 2001 I went to Disney World with my family. It was by far the best time I had in the three times that we went. It was fucking empty. Everyone was still scared to fly because of 9/11 and so no one wanted to vacation.  
We got to go on Space Mountain, but they wouldn't let us stay on the car to go again, so my brother and I ran as fast as we could own the exit tunnel, wrapped around the side of the building and then sprinted down the entrance tunnel and got back on immediately. To people who have gone on Space Mountain as a kid, you know how amazing this feeling would be. We probably did this at least a dozen times.  
Then when we went to Animal Kingdom, there was a water ride that I think was called Callie River Rapids or something similar. We didn't even get off the ride, the person at the booth just asked if we wanted to go again. If we stayed on that ride for less than six of seven times I would be surprised. We walked around the park soaking wet for the rest of the day and not a single shit was given.   
As horrible as 9/11 was, without it I wouldn't have had the best vacation I have ever had. It really just reminds me that every bad thing in the world has a silver lining for someone. This is the first thing that pops into my mind whenever there is a thread on /r/askreddit about what you would do if you were the only person on earth. Plot twist. Disneyland was closed for maintenance - Op broke in Griswold style. Damm i wish i was there. This is amazing. 

Here in the UK I try to strike up some conversation with people about measles and vaccination thing and they know nothing about it.

The tail length in fully grown males is about 1 m (39 in). Weights of up to 318 kg (701 lb) have been recorded, but none of these cases can be confirmed via reliable sources.

The typical weight range of historical Siberian tigers as 180 to 306 kg (397 to 675 lb) for males and 100 to 167 kg (220 to 368 lb) for females.

I'm 6'2"", 215lbs and when they were standing like that against a chain-link fence between us, his paws were a foot over my head. 

You don't really realize how huge they are till you get that close. ESPECIALLY when they get on their hind legs. I am sure a 150 lb dog could take out an healthy adult human. Tigers can reach 855 lbs in the wild.

The fight might not always go to the biggest or the fastest but it is the safe way to bet.For all we know, she (the woman) is extremely short...I could still probably take it with my bow and a few healing syringesIt always amazes me how much bigger cats get when they slinky out like that. My house cat seems to double in size when he tries to reach something up high.In the picture of the woman, the camera lines up to perfectly camouflage the tree moss with the grass.The Amur tiger is recorded as the largest cat in the world, and not surprisingly it is rather endangered with a breeding population of ~250. 
John Valliant wrote an amazing book not only about the tiger, but the people who have lived alongside these titans in eastern Russia and Manchuria.

For those who are interested. The difference between Siberian and Bengal tigers is the size. Siberian tigers are bigger and heavier than Bengal ones. Siberian tiger's fur is also bit more pale than Bengal one :)

If you've ever been next to one when they roar, that's something to be experienced. It's loud as hell and fucking rumbles. You can feel it in the ground, all through your body.Every tiger is big when you're confronted with it.  

Dad was perched on a rock eight or ten feet off the ground pulling guard duty in the jungle of Vietnam circa 1969 or so.  It was dusk.  They were under strict orders not to shoot a tiger with an M16.  It was highly unlikely that the small caliber round would kill the tiger, and a wounded tiger would potentially be unable to hunt for normal prey.  Instead they would pick easier prey.  People.  Having the entire countryside up in arms and trying to kill you was bad enough without a giant killing machine after you as well.

Suddenly, tiger.  It didn't stalk out of the jungle.  I was just there.  It eyed dad.  Dad eyed it.  They stared at each other for about three years.  It reared up and sniffed his boot...and disappeared.  It didn't just stroll back into the jungle.  It was just gone.

Needless to say, dad needed a change of underwear, but he has a great story to tell and be retold.All tigers are big....Save the Tigers!the lady is actually up in the tree in the second picture. silly hungry kittyNot as big as my penis!So there I am, in Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, looking for one thousand brown M&Ms to fill a brandy glass, or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night.

So there's me, and Keith Moon, and David Crosby, breaking into that little sweets shop, eh. Well, instead of a guard dog, they've got this bloody great big Siberian tiger. I managed to take out the tiger with a can of mace, but the shop owner and his son... that's a different story altogether. I had to beat them to death with their own shoes. Nasty business, really.

Can't wrap my head around itI feel like the quote ""no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible"" fits here.serves that steel right for going against the grainThat's due to small amount of amorphous silica in the chaff or maybe the grain itself. Grasses evolved the ability to make silica,  it's used as a defence against herbivorous insects, it wears down their jaws. The silica would have a Mohs hardness of about 5.5, which is harder than steel. 

[Silica in grasses as a defence against insect herbivores: contrasting effects on folivores and a phloem feeder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16638012)

Edit: spelling

It's the reason the teeth of herbivores such as rabbits and horses continuously grow, they are constantly worn down by silica in the grass. 

> Silica, deposited as opaline phytoliths in the leaves of grasses, constitutes 2-5% of dry leaf mass, yet its function remains unclear. It has been proposed that silica may act as an antiherbivore defence by increasing the abrasiveness and reducing the digestibility of grass leaves,Approximately how long does it take for grain to do that to a sheet of metal?There's a joke about steel-cut oats in there somewhere...I'll never question gluten allergies again.

A couple years back we were up there, and a piece of wood about a foot long popped out the end, all that was left of the broomhandle from years of being worn down by the grain.

Silky smooth finish on it, too. You need ceramic liners, less damage from shear. 

-Expert material handling chute designerWhat many people don't know is that this is how breakfast cereals ""Fortified with Iron"" first came about.

The cereal manufacturers realized that there was no good way to separate the microscopic shavings of metal from the grain product for their cereal. This was post industrial revolution; the FDA was becoming a ""real"" enforcement agency, and it was stepping up the regulations around adulterated food products. A man working for Kellog named Andrew Wright was on the team working to resolve this issue before the FDA could fine them (or shut them down). By coincidence, Andrew's father was a medical doctor at the time working in the field of nutriton and defining what we now know are RDA (recommended daily allowances) for various vitamins and minerals. Andrew discovered that Iron was on his father's list of recommended minerals, but in too small of a quantity. He tried to convince his father to increase the value to coincide with the amount found in the cereal, and his father agreed to do it on the condition that Andrew pay him about tree fiddy.I actually sell/install grain elevator and silos in California.

I was a manager at a video (VHS) rental store back in the 90s.  Got a call from my landlord that told me that my house had exploded and my parents were likely dead, and that I needed to come home.  (I just moved in two days before).  I called my boss and told them that I *HAD* to go immediately, and they told me that I could not.  That I had to choose between my personal and professional life.  

So I drew a goddamn map to the nearest competitor (Blockbuster) and wrote a sign on the door that said, ""My house exploded moments ago, my parents might have died inside, and my boss told me I could not leave.

My parents lived, by the way.  They were moving to VA that day from FL and had planned to stop at my place and drop off some curtains.  Because they were going to be driving, they stayed at a fast food place and ate there - otherwise they would have been at the house.Why didn't you file a police reportAt my last job, I was hit in the face by an employee, that happened to be the GM's brother.  GM freaked out, said we were both fired, then 2 other guys said that was messed up, threatened to quit if I was fired for getting hit. He ended up firing no one that day. The next day he fired the guys who stood up for me then gave his brother a raise.  I quit 2 days later when I was scheduled to work with his brother.

First, the sex chromosomes in crustaceans are not XY, but ZW, where the male is the homogametic sex (ZZ). Secondly,  mosaicism can be caused by non-disjunction and other factors,  you cannot assume it is on a sex chromosome.  It's more likely OP inspected the lobster and determined it's gender before posting. Check your facts.

That way everything is safe from being damaged, and there is plenty more usable space on the wall for other potential devices, timers etc, that you would want in in close proximity of your panels. Unless this was requested, it just looks like a fancy waste of time. That being said, if it's the guy's own house and he just wanted it to look extremely neat, then so be it. Oh ya, that's not to code where I'm from, and it seems like it's either the states or Canada, and we have almost identical codes, so I'm sure it's not to code where ever it is. Please don't flame me, most other qualified electricians would agree.It would seem to me that ""cable management"" allows for easy changes. When people do this, they are no longer cables, but a permanent ""circuit board"" type thing. It seems counterproductive to do this.Am i the only one disapionted in the wall socket cable management?This is a complete waste of time and NOT how you should run RX cable.  Should have put a trough near the ceiling and run all the RX cables into it.  Then connect the trough the the panels with some EMT.  All connections are made in the trough and the wall would not be uselessly covered in cables.  The way this guy did this leaves no room for expansion and makes any future work from these panels much more difficult.                                      

TL;DR:  Looks pretty but is a nightmare to work on later. On the surface of it all (No pun intended) it looks all nice and pretty but infact its a terrible way to dress and terminate cabling. You've essentially made that board unworkable on now. It's using up way more space than it should! No practical electrician would do that.Jesus, how many milk bottles filled with urine does this dude have stored.Very spiffy!  I'd be far too paranoid about all that romex being exposed, though, since that's clearly a multi-purpose room.  No way I wouldn't put those into conduit.  Not as pretty, but far safer.Although it looks nice it is definitely not legal according to the NECElectrical contractor here. If one of my guys did this I'd send him home for his OCD meds and then get some one else to fix it. 

The wires would be better managed in pipe or something similar and would take up way less wall space.Where i live this wouldnt fly. If its coming out a panel & not inside a wall it better be in conduit or either in mc or bx cable. No romex or single wire can be exposed like that. 

That would suck though to do all that & then fail inspection & have to do all that again in conduit or mc cable! Either way it makes for a nice picture!Because fuck conduit, right?My brother was just renovating an old house he bought that was largely build by amateurs from the looks of it. Was very satisfying to compare the work of professionals to an amateur's. Simple but genious solutions for many things I'd never think about.

They are our link to the past. It's like when my dad's parents died, and they were my last grandparents to go. In addition to grieving the loss of two people we all absolutely loved, we also lost the last link to all of the first hand knowledge of parts of history like the great depression and WW2 in our family. When these people go, any opportunity to ask any questions we haven't yet thought to ask will die with them. And it's just not the same to read writings or listen to or watch old recordings of folks talking about the too distant past. There's nothing like sitting across from someone with firsthand knowledge of a time so long in the past like that, and hearing them tell you personally, exactly what tricks their parents pulled to keep the family off the street during the depression or what it was like to deal with scared and hostile civilians in Berlin at the end of the war.

Considering you can redeem hotels for as low as 2000-3000 points it's a good deal and I've taken them up on it every timeToo bad I don't get $6 every time I waive room cleaning at home. I would be able to pay for groceries like that.Oh man, I just stayed at a hotel for a work conference and ~~the world's most awkward~~ thing happened. 

It was like 3:30pm and my room still had yet to be cleaned. All I needed were fresh towels and sheets. So I buzzed the front desk and told them. They were SUPER apologetic and told me someone would be in right away to clean. I politely told them I didn't need anything cleaned or sanitized because I don't like the smell of cleaner.

So I go downstairs to the convention hall and just chill for a bit. I go back to my room and there's a team of 4 maids cleaning my room from top to bottom- including 2 of them on their hands and knees scrubbing my bathroom floor. I told them all I needed were fresh towels and sheets and that they didn't need to go through all the trouble. They left and the smell of cleaning product was so overwhelming I had to open a window and go away for another hour.

So, in conclusion, I wish hotels just had a ""light cleaning"" option that only gave new sheets and towels and not just-after-a-murder level of cleaning.I love how hotels are all... For the environment! When in reality it is ALL about labor cost. This is actually a pretty common practice these days. For example, many Starwood hotels (brands like Westin, Sheraton, St. Regis, W, etc.) will give you 500 Starpoints (most people value this at over $10) or a $5 voucher each day you decline room cleaning. 

[Source](http://www.starwoodpromos.com/westingreenchoice/?EM=VTY_WI_GREENCHOICE_PROMOTION)Step 1 - Raise Rates $6.

Step 2 - Reduce Rates For A Small Fraction Of People Who Agree To Program.

Step 3 - Profit Additional $6 Per Room. I would never opt for this. One of my favorite parts of staying in a hotel is coming back after a long day to a freshly cleaned room. No one can make up a bed like hotel housekeeping.I like that.  When I stay at hotels, I only ask for room service every three days or so, and I've *never* seen any kind of benefit.More like ""In order to reduce the operating cost of cleaning""

They will be saving more than $6 in labour and materials by doing this, or they would not be doing it.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's a good thing... but there is absolutely a profit motive behind it.  (and it's a good kind of profit motive)
I waive room cleaning anyway, just because I'd rather not have anyone coming into the room. Ever. I'm only here for a week. You can clean it after I check out. There was a protest about this in Toronto recently and it was explained why cleaning staffs hate this, which is the hidden side the hotel doesn't want to mention.

Staff is scheduled for the week assuming all or most rooms need daily cleaning. Then in the evening, the night manager will walk around to check which rooms opted out of cleaning for the next day. He/she then adjusts the schedule as necessary, and calls unneeded staff late that night or early the next morning to say their shift is cancelled.

It fucks the cleaning staff in multiple ways. They work fewer hours and lose pay if not needed, that's a given. But they are unable to pick up a second job to make up those hours because they can't predict when/if the hotel will cancel their shifts. Plus the added annoyance of getting a call after midnight telling you not to come in to work.####They'll pay an extra $6 if you clean it yourself. They'll take off an extra $20 if you dont use the beds and if you choose not to stay there at all, it will be absolutely free. Yeah it's for the ""environment"". I'm sure saving on labor costs has nothing to do with it.I stayed at a hotel in Vegas that did this and the guy who's name the room was under took advantage of this. The problem was it was Vegas and there were four guys in the room. By day three of adamant refusal to have the room cleaned (it was foul) I threw a $20 bill at him to cover his losses so the room could be sanitized.  Fuck the earth, I just don't want someone rummaging about my room and moving my things around every day. Sounds like a eco-friendly business ploy, but I wonder how they save annually by hiring less staff.Relevant: [Wash My Damn Towels](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4nnUWQu9l48)What if I compost my own shit on site, 5 bucks a day?

The funny thing was the one I reeled in was better than the one I was using.I'd be wary... Seems like metal detectors don't last long round these parts. What you've got there is a beat-frequency oscillation model, which is the most basic type of metal detector. The BFO type transmits a beat frequency radio signal that is balanced by tuning the detector until a slight sound is heard through the speaker or headphones. This type of detector uses two coils: one large coil in the search head and a smaller coil in the control box. Each coil is connected to an oscillator which generates a steady frequency, with each coil having a slightly different frequency. This difference in frequencies will cause a steady ""beat"" which can be picked up by the receiver in the control box. Any metal or mineral in range of the signal will interfere with the frequency in the search coil, causing a change in the duration and tone of the beat frequency.

They are not protesting for the same thing:

from u/anon_na_mouse 
""as for why they're protesting, here is my explanation: Essentially, for the past several years the police, firefighters, bus drivers etc. Have foregone raises in their salaries to get a better pension plan where the city pays more (70%-30%). Both parties agreed to this, but then the city took money from their pension fund to do other stuff. Now they don't want to put it back, partially because their investments fell through. They want the workers to pay extra retroactively to replenish the pension fund. Regardless of what people's opinions on the city workers is, to me it's not an issue of if they deserve good pensions or raises or whatever, the issue is that the city stole money from them and doesn't want to give it back.
""Does a smoke grenade launcher really need an eotech?*Point blank*. F me, that's the second time I screwed that up. 

Edit - Ok I get it, that is not point *blank*. It's just very close. Sorry for all of the confusion. A true canadian cop. His shin guards are held in place with hockey sock tapeAnyone else spot Morpheus in the background?Montreal University student here. If you're curious as to the current situation here in Montreal and why protests are going down, here's a simplified version:

Government needs to make cuts somewhere in order to recover financially. They're putting into practice ""austerity"" which essentially means they'll be cutting funding to schools among other things. The protests here in Montreal are namely ""anti-austerity"" and those demonstrating are doing so not like in 2012 when tuition was rising, but because funding is being cut that should be used in schools.

Personally, I support the protesters and am anti-austerity. One thing worth noting however is that the protesters have begun interrupting ongoing classes in various departments. This is something I 100% am against. They've literally been walking into classrooms which are in session and [making a disturbance to try to cancel them](http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Raw+Video/ID/2660534897/)

Some might argue that they can drum up awareness for the situation by going to such lengths but then the counter-argument to this would be ""I paid for these classes, you have no right to force them to be cancelled""

Anyways, thought you guys would like a point of view from someone living in Montreal who attends a University. 

Edit: Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRWesxFWaTM) which shows the protests, and the disturbances, in a much more organized and clear wayIf this was taken this week, the protest isn't about school fees but cut in general in many place such has social services, health care, education !The protester isn't only protesting against education cuts. He's protesting against austerity in general.""I can hire one-half of the working class to kill the other half.""-Jay GouldI expect people to go soft, as this is not an American cop.

>""This picture seems to be lacking lots of context""

>""I understand that this doesn't create that satisfying sense of injustice, but a basic understanding of that facet of protesting these days should be kept in mind""

I would like someone to tell me with a straight face that this is what the comments would look like if it were an American cop.
When both the students and the civil staff have to protest the higher-ups negatively affecting their quality of life, perhaps it's time to realize that our leadership isn't all it's cracked up to be.I participated in some protests to George W. Bush's visit to Canada pre-Iraq invasion and occupation.

What I observed in those is something people don't want to hear: protestors often force the hand of law enforcement, and they do so quite consciously.

I have no idea what's going on in this scene of course, but it may well be that this protestor was instructed not to get any closer. In all such cases that I saw, protesters push the boundaries until there's really no choice but to hold some line. In so doing, protesters are often posturing as depicted in this photo, with other protesters screaming about this horrific scene of fascism unfolding before them, yelling *""WHAT'S YOUR NAME??""* to fellow protesters as they get arrested, as though they're going to be disappeared...

I understand that this doesn't create that satisfying sense of injustice, but a basic understanding of that facet of protesting these days should be kept in mind  that of the struggle devolving into ""us against the cops that happen to be in front of us"".

Edit: Thank you for the gold!  
Just to add a thought about the other side of the coin, I think the two players in that photo represent two extremes, and neither extreme is right. The ""target"" in this photo would appreciate the law and order that protecting say, a left-leaning policy. ""Law-and-order"" types should be less inclined to be amoral enforcers. I made a quip about a fascist scene, but in *actual* fascistic events, their type is there, making it it all possible.

Just moved to Montreal from Louisiana, and really, everyone has been protesting everything here. And it's all in French! I never know what the hell is going onIf anyone actually cares about truth here, that is a 40mm multi-launcher. 40mm munitions come in a variety of types including some direct fire impact munitions, skip for impact munitions, chemical agent rounds and more. 

It is entirely likely he is not aiming a ""smoke grenade"" at the protester but a direct fire sponge impact round that while unpleasant is less lethal at 5 feet to out part 100.

To be fair, that's not just a ""smoke grenade launcher.""  it's an M-32 40mm grenade launcher and can use [all sorts of nifty ammunition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40_mm_grenade) aside from smoke grenades. I especially admire the red-dot sight he's got going on the top rail, it must be the ""bad at geometry"" version. It's not a smoke grenade launcher. It's a 40mm (or 37mm) launcher, which can launch everything from signal devices to smoke to bean bags and other non-lethal munitions. I'm guessing it had the latter, since shooting a smoke canister like that would be terrible for the protester and likely send the cop to jail. idk, seems more like 4 feet to meStill not buying Hardline.$5 says it's a riot gun that fires bean bags. 

That's an M-32 grenade launcher, which can perfectly shoot riot type ammo.

edit: The first link might not be legit, thanks /u/TelepathicWhat do they do with it next? http://imgur.com/IWOFaYIAwww, this makes me think of the film Big Fish, and then it makes me cry. Well at least he unblocked the water flow in Zora's domainAbout how old would a catfish that size have to be?The article says they released it. Which is good because a big old catfish like that would've tasted like absolute ass. 

I just realized I've commented on a picture like this before and spent the next day and a half explaining why this is so here:

First off fish filter water through their bodies to gather oxygen and breath. As they live and breath they pick up stuff in the water throughout their lives (toxins and minerals and all that jazz) the older  (and usually bigger) a fish is the more it's had time to be more saturated with whatever they've been swimming around in their whole lives. Meaning a big old catfish would taste like ass and probably not have the best texture either. This applies to pretty much all fish even those swimming is crystal clear water (though obviously to a much lesser extent, they'd have more room for margin) but catfish often live by skimming the bottom of rivers and lakes meaning they come in contact more with junk you as a human wouldn't want to eat and that slowly builds up in their system. 

Besides that big old fish like this make A LOT of babies, big females make more eggs, big males can fertilize more eggs. I went over this with tuna as well, you don't want to catch and eat a big ass old tuna because first off the smaller regular size ones will taste better and second the old big ones make more little baby Tunas which allows the population to grow and survive. 

Tl;Dr - big old fish like this catfish have spent a long life filtering a lot of junk through their bodies and they taste bad. They're best being left to live and make babies because these big fuckers make a lot of babies. *~the more you know~*

Whenever I fly, I'm always amazed at the level of technology that goes into the vehicle I'm in. I look at all the screws, panels, and think about the amount of human energy that went into every little thing. From pulling the metal out of the ground, to adding the last coat of paint. Then on top of that, this vehicle is being piloted by a professional that can land this massive vehicle, with hundreds of lives aboard, without even being able to physically see where he/she is going.
  
Though I understand all the principles behind each step of this achievement, it's still magic to me.Video of 747 through fog: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCQyw_dzHeoAfter 45 years still the sexiest flying chunk of aluminum around.....

Riiiight[deleted]Hey charlotte! That's where I am, what part ? North/uptown? That's actually really good of them to do something like that, getting certain charges as a minor can completely fuck you later on in life, unless you have the money to fight them (and since this is apparently a ghetto store, I'm assuming the families don't).

I work in food service, and if you don't know, a lot of criminals work in that industry (we're pretty loose about background checks or drug tests, plus drinking on the job is typically alright). I've seen everything from hardened felons to people that just did something stupid when they were a kid (which we all have done) and it screwed their life up, those are probably the most heart-breaking. Shoplift when you are 16, get arrested, get charged as an adult. Now you've got theft on your record, which means you're having trouble finding scholarships and applying to colleges, even if you worked hard and made good grades. God forbid you stole more than what is considered ""petty"" (easy to do if you're stealing something like clothing, which can be $100 for a pair of pants), you've now got a felony on your record. 

That means by the time you turn 18, you're already fucked, even if you didn't do any real time in the can. Job opportunities close, universities won't take you, scholarships are pretty much unavailable (except for certain forms of government financial aid). It pretty much fast tracks you into a life of crime. Hopefully one day the judicial system will wise up and discover their policies are just creating more criminals.This is really a good thing. With the current state of our criminal justice system and police force, we need to start working together as a community. We have to deal with crime and people behaving badly, but we can't give the police the chance to destroy our young people's lives.

Edit: Forgot a word.thoughtful, but those teens are probably fucked any way you look at itI am really at a loss what opinion to hold.  Punishment is necessary to rectify bad behavior, but our justice and prison system is so fucked that the punishment would never fit the crime and would likely encourage further bad behavior.Slightly ghetto. 

Chynah. 


Checks out. I'm still laughing at the spelling of Saturday as Saturdy at the beginningChynah is a Badass name !Good luck with that.Assuming they're, you know, literate.i think it's cool as fuck... don't set a kid on a path to prison for a single indiscretion, but if you do it again, you're headed to the hoscow.If you show someone that they can get away with bad behavior: they will never stop the bad behavior, and will only get worse. It's the same principle as lovers who are cheated on who forgive their partner. That tells them they can cheat again with impunity. If Chynah really wanted to help these kids she'd punish them so they could become better people. Reinforcing their bad behavior will only make them much, much worse.

People act as if this is just kids being kids. What they neglect to consider is that adult psychopaths started off as child psychopaths at some point. Sometimes a spade is a spade and not an upside down heart that needs filled.Fuck that. Petty theft is a very low level misdemeanor. It wouldn't ruin their lives. On the other hand, if the owner of the convenience store let herself get ripped off by every juvenile that walked through the doors, she would quickly be out of business. I would press charges without hesitation. QC representX-Pac has her back.Chynah.  That is all.Chynah.I once stole a set of Pogs from the gas station across the street from my house when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I went home, changed clothes and went back later to buy some snacks with some loose change I found around the house. They recognized me immediately. I was not a smart kid.> Saturdy OHHHH so *that's* how you spell China.

Apparently they weren't taking any new employees, but that wasn't anything to worry about.

They had us all working overtime painting the place and ""rejuvenating"" it before the new year, told us we were actually doing well enough to get some of the staff from elsewhere over as extra help.

The day before my Christmas eve shift I get a call at home from some woman I've never met. 

She says ""Don't come in tomorrow. The store is closing, we're shutting it down and you will not get access again.""

Company is screwed.  Lost $150 million in 2 years,  stock went from around $3 down to 7 cents.  You can't be selling much when you are losing that much money.[Scumbag Wet Seal?](http://i.imgur.com/sJBGJqg.png)When I first saw a Wet Seal in my local mall years ago, my sometimes-dyslexic mind interpreted the name as We Steal.  I guess I wasn't wrong.Original Post 
http://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/2rc7dj/looks_like_wet_seal_at_the_dayton_mall_is_closing/What the hell is Wet Seal?  

I've got a hunch, but there's no way it's accurate.This sort of thing really sucks. My aunt has story like this where she worked for a local small time pet shop. The location was pretty bad, there were only a three employees that were paid mostly under the table, and the spoiled housewife owner became really absent from the business as a whole when she realized that loving animals and managing a business were two different things. Even though she knew it was a failure, my aunt really enjoyed her job, and was a retiree anyways, so she agreed to stay on for minimum wage.

One night, she gets a call from her boss out of the blue, that the shop is closing right then and there without warning. Aunt was pissed, got into it with the lady, parted on bad terms. About two days later she gets to feeling bad about it, goes back to the shop to turn in her keys and apologize and whatnot, and discovers that nobody has even stepped foot in the place since she last left. No signs saying they were going out of business, animals all still there in their cages, none of them even tended to. The bitch had every intention of locking the doors and hoping the problem went away. She called the authorities, and the owner made up some lie that she and her husband miscommunicated about who would stop by and take care of the animals until they found homes (even though he had never even stepped foot in the shop before). She got away with it too, but my aunt checked every day to make sure none of the animals were dead after that, until they were all relocated. http://i.imgur.com/xyK67.jpgEmployers assume that if they give you even minimum notice that the store is closing and you're getting laid off that you'll start stealing or just doing a shitty job.  rich corporate type severely underestimated the common decency of blue-collar workers, if you treat your people decent and don't lie to them they'll do their job.

I know it's anecdotal but I worked for a corporate restaurant that was losing its lease.  Management was told not to say anything, literally just close up one day and put a sign on the door.  Word got out anyways, and everyone kept working.  We were supposed to have one month left and no one quit plenty of us found extra work but we were loyal. Turns out we got a six-month extension and still retained over 90% of our workers.  What a surprise, you give your people time to line up new work and plan for the future and they stay loyal until the end.  Never heard of this store before, but seriously Wet Seal. ? What a stupid name.   Maybe for car wax, or floor mats or something but not for clothes.  haha I worked at a Wet Seal in the local mall that did the same thing. I couldn't be bothered to write a sign though so I just stole thousands of dollars worth of merchandise instead. Those wet seals seem to be a slippery bunch.Severance pay for retail? Are you high?No Jeverance. Those monsters.These piece of shit stores pop all the time and close because they can't evolve with the changing fashion. Anyone remember chess king?Haha typical. When I worked there I was constantly shorted on my pay. My vacation/sick time would magically decline without me using it. They still owe me around $300 in pay that they refuse to answer calls/emails about. Oh and for a good year they were taking taxes out for 2 states even though my paperwork clearly stated that I lived/worked in Rhode Island Didn't even know that shop was still around. Considering Wet Seal's demo is 14-17 year old white suburban girls, I highly doubt these signs have any impact, at all. 

Besides, just look at their financials.  They're in the toilet already and not long for this world, so no great loss. I'm a manager at radioshack. We're going through the same shit.  O warning, shitty treatment and refusal to admit were closing. From their Mission and Values statement:
 We are Real We have integrity and treat each other with deep respect. We value every member of our team and every person that walks through our doors.

We are Invested We believe in our people, products, processes, and communities and show it by investing in them. We make a difference in the lives of those that we employ and serve.

We are The Wet Seal family. If they really are getting screwed out of overtime and/or sick/vacation time, they need to contact the Department of Labor and sue the employer. They deserve what they're owed, plain and simple, and many employers will quickly pay the money when they get a call from the Dept. of Labor asking questions.Contact the Labor Relations Board about them stealing your vacation. That is criminal and you could be awarded triple for things like this.A relative of mine managed wet seals for YEARS! (Im gunna guess 10ish) Asked her to come manage a new store in LA, she moved her life out there and they did this exact thing to her within a month. Fuck wet seal. some years ago there was a textile mill a few miles from here that did the same thing. They even went as far as to make up fake orders. The workers though things were going great. All the machines were running wide open. Then one morning they found the gate locked and an big sign that read CLOSED in big red letters. The police almost had a riot on their hands. People had personal stuff in the mill and were told they could not get it. One man had over $3000 worth of tools in the mill. In the end every one got their tools and stuff but the whole thing was very shitty if you ask me.","{'Sadness': 0.062243, 'Emotional_Range': 0.815, 'Tentative': 0.385, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.365334, 'Analytical': 0.155, 'Conscientiousness': 0.09, 'Agreeableness': 0.761, 'Joy': 0.055701, 'Disgust': 0.128159, 'Extraversion': 0.691, 'Openness': 0.174, 'Anger': 1.0}",{'abandoned': 0.268941}

That kid will probably remember that moment for the rest of his life -  walking through the streets of his liberated city, his father with a rifle around his neck and a hand on his head. And some day he might just grow up and have children and grandchildren of his own, and then they'll look to him. When things seem dark and hopeless they'll look to him, and I'd like to think that when they do, he'll look back on this moment and the man *he* looked up to once, who made a decision to fight against tyranny and how much that responsibility must have weighed on him and how much courage and character it must have taken and how much suffering and anguish it must have caused him and it will give him strength to carry on even when he thinks he can't.

More information about the dog here:

www.nydailynews.com/new-york/living-9-11-ground-zero-search-dog-returns-site-article-1.1936151#bmb=1

Her name is Bretagne for those curious.


**EDIT:** wow to whoever gave me reddit gold, thanks so much. Its a pleasure receiving gold after like 4 days this comment was made, I thought no body would see this post anymore but you proved my wrong :) long live Bretagne!I was a first responder to the attacks and later, a rescue and recovery worker on the pile. We're necessarily an emotionally bottled group and even more so at that time. I remember sitting on a clean pile of garbage next to one of the FEMA dog teams to grab something to eat. I grabbed this dusty golden retriever and just held him for a few minutes. The dog, for his part, seemed to get it and let me hug him. It was the most I let go to that point and probably since then. Those dogs got a lot of love down there mostly because they're safe - they don't judge, they don't talk back, our secrets and our emotions are safe with them. 

That dog was my hero and I hope he lived out the life he deserved to live. I hope he had a family that loved him and let him do all those cool dog things they seem to love but that we'll never understand. I hope he had a warm bed and peaceful dreams untroubled by the things he'd seen. And I hope that when his final moments came, he was surrounded by the people he loved and welcomed by a God that has a special place for heroes.

tl;dr Dogs freaking rule. Sorry for venting.That really puts in perspective how long it has been. It's like a sped-up version of WWI/II vets at a Remembrance Day ceremony - fewer and fewer until there's only one left.

Who then gets the stash of stolen Nazi paintings, obviously.They should make a bronze bust of this dog to commemorate the canine efforts and put it at ground zero  People are older too.  The War On Terror is currently being fought by people who were small children on 9/11.She's a good girl. 

The rescue dogs at ground zero were upset and agitated by their failure to find survivors. Volunteers hid in the rubble so the dogs could find them.

This raised the dogs spirits and allowed them to continue their efforts. The sirens screamed for hours, but the smoke lingered for days. I'll always remember the smoke.I like when dogs get grey muzzles. It is kind of like when you see old Veterans with their uniform and medals on. They might smell a little off, andnot move that fast but they have don their time and usually have a calmness that only living a long, expansive life can bring.

Grey muzzles are like medals to dogs :)my cousin Barry galfano trained theese dogs and was captain of the first response unit on 9-11. amazing how this dog wound up out living him.. died of cancer due to inhaling debris. came on so suddenLooking at her sleeping peacefully during 9/11. It's calming for some reason.> Soon, the two (owner and handler) will travel to Beverly Hills for the American Humane Association's annual Hero Dog Awards ceremony. Bretagne is one of eight pups up for the top prize.

Which other dogs with Bretagne compete against for the Hero Dog awards?! She saved people from rubble after 9/11, if that isn't amazing I don't know what is!Other things to make you feel old.

http://xkcd.com/647/

http://xkcd.com/891/

Who's a good girl? Who's just a cute, cuddly, good little girl? Is it you? Yes! You're a good girl. Oh yes you are. Now come here so I can wuzz you!I love how the face hairs on goldens get white as they age :D""9/11 - never forge-- SQUIRREL!!!""Texas task force one!Sweet old girl.What a beautiful girl. Golden retrievers have such a caring demeanour, more so than any other dog, in my opinion. 

They love their humans. They want to make them happy. This pup  has lived  a great life doing something she was born to do. I remember reading rescuer works would occasionally hide in the rubble and let the dogs find them to give them a ""win"". Otherwise the dogs would become depressed if they went too long without finding a victim. Did she have to pay $24.00 to visit the memorial or did they count her age in human years giving her the youth discount price of $15.00?

edit:  $24 is the museum price. The memorial is free.I wasn't expecting these kind of feels on a Saturday morning, thanks OP.'I like what you've done with the place'. Lets all remember the dog as symbol of resistance peace and humanity.
Happy birthday Bretagne.That is not THE last surviving dog 

""This one has feathery fur, a sunny smile, a calm nature and  for a dog  an uncanny ability to zero in on the people who need her most. Shes a 15-year-old golden retriever named Bretagne, and shes one of the last surviving search dogs who worked at Ground Zero in New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. (Another surviving 9/11 search dog named Woodie, a 15-year-old golden retriever, also worked at Ground Zero, and a 15-year-old English springer spaniel named Morgan worked at Staten Island.)""

""You're either picking up your coat, you're buying a ticket for your coat, or you are leaving this train at the next stop.""

Suddenly, she could hear, and she picked up her coat. 

I'm reminded of a night train I took from Venice to Prague.  Me and a friend boarded the train and it was quite full.  One cabin was being held closed by someone inside.  I got a look in and it was 2 people who had made the cabin into a sleeper by laying the seats down.  They yelled at me in some language I didn't understand.  Not being as forceful as I am now, I relented and reserved myself to sit in the hall.  A minute or so a young guy came by and tried to open the door.  I mentioned to him that it was full.  He gave me a funny look and ripped the door open.  The two people inside started to yell at him in their language.  The young guy was Irish and proceeded to dress them down in a hilariously profane manner.  ""Cunt, fucking, shite"" were all used liberally.   He pushed their bags aside and raised the seats. I was a bit shocked.  Then he kindly invited me and my friend to take a seat.   Talk about death stares from the two originally inside.   But we were no longer sitting in the hallway.  Thank you kind Irish stranger. I would have sat down and thanked him for saving my seatThe only thing necessary for the triumph of douchiness is for good men to do nothing.

The structure stood 73 cm tall, weighed 147g and consisted of 272 pieces of pasta (not all whole). The stone weighed 3350g, giving the structure a support-to-weight ratio of at least 22,8.

I didn't dare to put more stress on it than 3,3 kg. I wouldn't be surprised if it could support 50% (or more) more.I built one in high school physics.  
1lb of pasta  
Hot Glue  
At least 24"" tall  
  
We loaded it progressively to 180 lbs and it held for 30 seconds.  
We then added another 45 lbs for a total of 225 lbs and it held for about 5 seconds then the whole thing exploded. Pasta went everywhere.

TL;DR
Pasta is stronger than you think.
Dammit where were you for my 4th grade team project?Once I made one of those, it was strong enough to *almost* support a marshmallow.For my fellow ~~American's~~ Americans here, that's 3.3kg, not 33kg.Popsicle stick bridge.  Best physics class contest ever.

Our teacher sorted lots with equal quality sticks; some poor, some good, some pristine, and dyed the lot a different colour each year.

He weighed each lot.  You were allowed a certain % of glue based on the mass of your lot.

He had a test rig for loading the bridges.  You knew exactly how the load was applied, and had to make a certain clear span.

I didn't win, but it was fun the whole time.

RIP spaghetti 2015-2015Reminds me of a story my physics teacher told me. A student was entering a contest that had students construct similar towers with only wood products. The lightest tower that could hold a certain weight for a certain amount of time would win. The student asked for advice and all the teacher said was, ""Cylinders are strong.""

The student showed up to the competition with a posterboard taped over into a cylinder. Other people in the competition asked if that's what his tower was in, and he responded, ""No, this is my tower."" In a competition probably filled with people making complex towers with toothpicks, glue, and complex designs, a posterboard with tape won first place.We once made a bridge out of paper and glue from a glue stick *(really shitty glue, but it was to avoid people just making a thick bar of paper and glue)* spanning half a metre, weighing 100 grams that could support 27 kgs. But this looks even more impressive, because well... it's spaghetti.I cannot encounter the phrase ""structural integrity,"" without thinking about Star Trek.I hated to calculate trellises in college, but this is damn cool. [deleted]What type of glue did you use?I had a school project where the whole class built little bridges out of toothpicks and glue. My group literally drenched our bridge in glue every day.

Wonder what his lungs look like.Source on the original article: http://shanghaiist.com/2014/12/09/yiwu-red-factories-world-christmas-decor-made.php

I've spent six months living in this region of China visiting over 50 factories and walking past countless more. The reality is more nuanced. The photos from here are the worst I've seen but not to the point of being unbelievable. 

* For context, a cleanish factory in this region looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/cp2eJgQ.jpg
* A typical factory looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/bzpsz5r.jpg
* A messy workshop looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/tQtOyRr.jpg

These are all within 1 standard deviation or so of a typical factory. The one featured within the article looks like it's 3.

China is a huge place and they make a huge portion of the worlds total consumer goods. The best things (your smartphones) and the worst things (the lighter you got at the gas station that looks like a tiny gun but broke after the second time you used it) are made there. The factories are on just as big of a spectrum. They have 4x the population of the US and 100x more factories. *There are things that they can make in factories there that we can not make in the US here.*

Yiwu itself is something of an enigma. Most people in Silicon Valley (where I spend my other 6 months) haven't heard of it. It's not political like Beijing, it's not financial like Shanghai, and it's not electronics or fashion like Shenzhen/Guangdong. The land is barren so the area has focused on International trade and commodity production. Most of it's goods don't even go to the US.

Yiwu is the largest exporter of ""petty goods"" or ""small commodities"" in the world. What's a petty good? It's pretty much any item bigger than your thumbnail and smaller than your torso that's generic and usually intended for re-use. Umbrellas, bags, metal pencil holders, hammers, hair dryers, pots, pans, artificial flowers, lawn ornaments, flashlights, hair clips, lucky cat figurines, picture frames, toilet plungers, mailboxes and battery jumpers. I.e. most of the things you buy in stores that you don't eat (commodities). It's also usually the first thing that comes to mind when you hear ""Made in China.""

There is a mall in Yiwu nick-named 'the Snake.' **It's 4 miles long, 1000 feet wide and has representatives from over 100,000 companies**. There's something like 50,000+ 10x10 foot stores. You could spend 6 seconds in each store and given another 3 to walk between stalls you still wouldn't see the whole thing after a year. Given most spaces change their stock or go out of business every 3 months you're kind of screwed. Mall of America eat your heart out.

Here's the thing though, it's all wholesale. Most of the goods on display are commercial samples. Most of the clerks are representing factories or consortiums. Yes, you can go there to do your Christmas shopping but you'll get dirty looks or no service at all. You don't go there with a shopping cart; you go there with a business card and a promise to fill a 40 foot container every 2 weeks.

Buyers are sometimes from brand name stores looking to sell store-brand goods - those Walgreen's brand picture frame hangers? Bought at Yiwu. Pretty much anything you find at Claire's boutique. Anything you find on the check-out counter or in those cheesy glass curios at any truck stop in this country. 

Most of the buyers however aren't American. They're from Brazil, they're from Africa, and in particular they're from the Middle East. After 2001 it became difficult for representatives from small business in the Middle East to get Visas for some of the US product exhibitions so they shifted their sourcing to Yiwu. These are guys that have a state level franchise like Railey's of Lebanon or Dollar Tree of Bangalore that need to fill shelves - frequently they'll buy whatever they get a good deal on if they hear the factory has excess or needs to liquidate stock because another buyer went belly-up. You go to north Dubai and you see a mirror image of the goods in Yiwu, just marked for consumer prices and packaged for individual sale.

So yeah, Yiwu has an office goods supply mall, a cabinet hardware mall, and yes, even a Christmas mall.

In business you tend to favor stability over fluctuations. Seasonal goods in particular present problems. If your company is producing something that requires very specialized tooling and training that's only in demand 1 month a year you're going to have a hard time keeping those trained workers around for the other 11 months.

The Christmas mall is a bit like this - they're open from March to May when buyers for TJMax and Tesco inspect goods and place orders. The factories are in production from June to September and then the stuff is sea-freighted out (1 month) to warehouse centers and fulfillment to prepare for the end of October, beginning of November delivery. Because of the seasonal nature, most of the prime-time work gets sub-contracted out to everybody and their auntie. This video has a pretty good look into what most of this production looks like: http://vimeo.com/92736460

For the most part, Christmas decor is low skill - just slather this plastic bit with chrome paint and sparkles. This makes it easy for factories to hire a bunch of workers on short notice and let them go again when demand drops off. Because the workers are seasonal there is little care that goes to protecting their well being. The guy covered in red powder thinks - ""Jeez, this is awful, but I'll only be doing it for 3 months so I can tolerate a bit of a cough for the next 6."" Cigarettes are a whole different problem in China that probably only makes this seem less bad. Likewise, the factory owner hasn't invested a lot to train up this worker so she is less concerned if he goes out sick in six months because of conditions. She's under a tremendous amount of pressure to land that contract with Winn-Dixie - her margins are already razor thin and she can't risk spending on safety equipment when it comes straight out of her own pocket. She very much has to make hay while the sun shines, and who knows what terrible fate is store for her family in 6 months. For instance, car insurance is kind touch and go (it's hard to prosecute) but the accident rate is stupidly high. Maybe she can land a gig painting masks for the V for Vendetta sequel but that's doubtful.

For all we know, the factory isn't always like this. The mask bit is super concerning and almost certainly in violation of some ISO 9001 regulation or other (really these dudes should be in full suites, respirators, goggles, and positive pressure rooms with special paint collector filtration. If anything it seems like some kind of screw-up - a fan in one room blowing particulate into another rather than through proper venting. The buyer probably isn't aware - if they were they almost certainly would say no way. Or maybe it really is this awful. Paint shops in that area are notorious for having all sorts of terrible stuff just lying around.

edit: The more I think about it, the more I think it went down like this. Cheap factory contracts to paint polystyrene decorations because they have a used vacuum chamber. Decorations are coated, placed in a chamber, electrically charged, pressure is reduced, red particulate is applied to stick to decorations, heat is applied to melt particulate, chamber isn't at a vacuum, heat causes gas to expand, BOOM, chamber blows a seal, red particulate everywhere. Oh shit, we don't have time to clean up this mess right now, this order is late. Let's patch it now and fix it when our factory shuts down next week. Three years laters: oh hi Mr. Photographer, no nothing is wrong here, no please come along to the next room!

There's kind of two paths forward for this sort of operation. Either they make work less seasonal so they improve overall condition - i.e. have a continuous holiday season - orange sparkly Halloween decorations, orange sparkly Thanksgiving decorations, red sparkly Christmas decorations, red sparkly Valentines decorations, invent some holidays for March, April, May, and then start the whole thing over again with red, white, and blue sparkly 4th of July decorations. Or less likely, we are exposed to the working conditions on marginal industries like this and decrease our demand for commodity crap like $0.25 Christmas tree decorations from Fry's and sparkly 4th of July Uncle Sam top hat memorabilia from Walmart.

**TLDR; it's fine to buy stuff from China, just next time ask yourself ""Is this a stupid piece of crap I am only going to use once?"" first.**[The room in the back might be where the decorations get sprayed with the red material.](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/12/12/christmas-factory-china_2.jpg)

http://shanghaiist.com/2014/12/09/yiwu-red-factories-world-christmas-decor-made.phpDid Santa explode in there?I get that everyone deplores the conditions in Chinese factories and condemns the companies that use them ( mostly on tumblr ) to create meaningless garbage, but really these people would not exist without these kinds of jobs. They can't sustain billions of people on no industry. The cheap wages and in turn cheap manufacturing costs, and yeah environmental damages are what keeps their economy afloat. If we boycotted, or they stopped, it would kill millions of people. So keep making fucking santa hats, ipods, and whatever else or there'll be a no child policy for a generation. It looks like this factory uses bits of real Santa :-D Do they make them by spraying everything in the room with blood?

Because that's sure as hell what that looks like.The saddest thing about this is that Santa hats are just a drop in the bucket. Anybody who lives in a first world nation is surrounded by luxury items that are produced by slave labor or something so close as to be indistinguishable.  It has become so pervasive that it seems we'll never break out of the cycle. Even the technology involved in maintaining our precious Internet is steeped in the sweat, tears and blood of these people whose only desire is to provide for themselves and their families. It's enough to make you want to throw it all away and dissappear into the mountains, never to participate in this twisted, unfair and destructive society.

For college he was trained at Sandhurst Military Academy.. That's Britain's national military academy.

The Jordanian leadership is in a very tough position. They need to simultaneously support U.S. and their own security interests, they need to appeal to the international community to deal with the enormous number of refugees (1 million +), and at the same time they need to appeal to the Islamist tribes that basically keep the King in power. 

I could practically write a book about it, but to boil it down: The King is bombing ISIS while his government and society simultaneously support harsh Islamic and antidemocratic rules and norms. 

Jordan has very little free speech and society mostly operates on a system where there is little economic mobility. The economy is not doing well and the media is blaming the million Syrian refugees rather than their own policies. 

On top of that, Jordan is a country that is currently bombing ISIS for being extremist. Yet, in 95% of rapes that went to court last year, the victim ended up marrying her attacker([source](http://jordantimes.com/95-of-rapists-go-unpunished-under-disputed-penal-code-provision)). Being gay here often means that you need to flee the country. Women are almost entirely excluded from the work force. 

Speaking of bombing ISIS, Jordan is actually the country that produces the most Al Qaeda and ISIS fighters per capita in the world ([source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/04/jordan-foreign-fighters_n_6613248.html)). The great irony is that these bombings in retaliation against ISIS are almost certainly killing Jordanians who are just on the wrong side of the conflict. 

The thing is, a lot of these societal issues are not a result of government policy, but they are just cultural norms. The King, who grew up in the U.S., probably wants to nudge his country in a more progressive direction, but doing so too vigorously would endanger support of his monarchy. 

Despite all of this, Jordanians are generally pretty supportive of the monarchy, but they have to say that because bad mouthing the King will get you thrown in prison. 

EDIT: Last year the government cancelled Halloween celebrations and threatened to arrest anyone wearing a costume. [The Atlantic has a good write up on why the government did this, and how it plays into the current political situation in Jordan.](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/why-has-jordan-banned-halloween/382207/)

EDIT 2: I thought this post on [/r/jordan](http://www.reddit.com/r/jordan/comments/2uoh91/anyone_else_here_experiencing_this_at_school/) was pretty revealing. Despite the governments best efforts to try and prevent radicalization, it's an uphill battle. 

EDIT 3: I get the feeling that this post is going to get some traction. I would like to add that there is a lot I like about living in Jordan, despite the very difficult situation it is in. People in general are extremely hospitable and friendly. Crime is actually quite low, so its a very safe country to travel in. The food is also wonderful. There are a ton of nice things to see in Jordan. Petra and Wadi Rum in particular are mind blowing. The views near the Dead Sea and into the valleys are great. It's definitely worth visiting. 

EDIT 4: I heard fighter jets about 2 hours ago. I thought it might have been just a show of support like the fly-by I heard yesterday. Nope. News reports are now saying they were hitting ISIS targets in Syria. There has definitely been a big shift in public opinion the last few days since the Jordanian pilot was gruesomely killed. Sure, the King is mostly doing a PR move here, but it's in a bid build local support for more airstrikes against ISIS. It will hopefully also slow the tide of Jordanian fighters heading to Iraq and Syria. Did you know he's an avid Star Trek fan and even appears in an episode of Voyager. I'm not surprised he's a stand up guy.

It's such a beautiful country.I'm so glad OP didn't spell it Columbia.The worlds tallest Palm tree in the world.. And no one had details?  For shame, Reddit.Anybody have any info on this tree?or trees like it?Valle del cocora is gorgeous. Also nearby is Salento, an amazing little town with warm people and cold weather Woo, that can make a really really long toothpick.What made it grow this tall? There are no other trees to compete for sunlight with, biologically it doesn't _need_ to grow this tall.How to grow your tree an extra 100 ft with just these 3 simple tricks! For some reason this photo gave me anxiety.  Anyone else?My girlfriend had a tattoo done just yesterday and we used this exact palm for the design. :)

Both my grandmas died before I was old enough to appreciate them.Mandelbaum! Mandelbaum! Mandelbaum!what is mind blowing to me is thinking of what year was the oldest guy in this picture born. OP any answer to that question?That is one big ass baby. Get it scanned and one of us will restore it for you.It's amazing how each generation beats the last in head circumference. The great-grandad looks like he's worried that the devil box stole part of his soulIt's like a time lapse of how you will age.Okay, let's say it was taken in 1960 (since the age kind of looks like photos I've seen of my parents from that time). If we guess that 24 years old is when people usually have kids. The grand dad could have been born in '36, the great grand dad in 1902, and the great great grand dad in 1878. So that old man who was born before lightbulbs and automobiles has now been seen by hundreds of thousands of people on screens all around the world ~142 years after he was born.

All estimates, but even substituting for the actual dates and ages, it's pretty incredible.did you end up tall and bald?[deleted]I'll see you and raise you one of me, my dad, my grandpa, and my great-grandpa I used as a show flyer a couple of years ago.

OP, i think you know what this means.His name is [Armen Ksajikian.](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0473280/)

He is not Russian, he's from Abkhazia. (It's a contested territory; most people associate it with Georgia, but was once part of the USSR).

He's an actor who can be recognized from a few movies (I always think of him in True Lies; very minor part but he stands out) *and* is a world class cellist. Cool dude, I met him in Sitka once (where this pic was taken).Ahh Sitka. Great Place. Lots of eagles.Pretty sure they're simply devising a plan on how to get up there and eat him.They're bearly listening. Bear+human=Russia? 
NO!!!
I am russian and i never see bear!NEVER....A guy from Kentucky is visiting New York for the first time. On a whim, he wanders into a music store. He walks up to the counter and asks the clerk, ""Can I see that fiddle you got up there behind the counter?"" 

""That's a violin, sir,"" the clerk responds. 

""Well can I see that violin, then?"" The clerk reluctantly hands the man the violin. The Kentuckian then proceeds to play the most beautiful music the clerk has ever heard. He is brought to tears and asks how he learned to play so wonderfully. 

""Ah man, I ain't never played before, I just thought it would be fun to try it out.""

""You know, I am very good friends with the conductor of the New York Symphony, and you can actually help him out of a bind. His first chair violinist became violently ill and they are performing in a few days. Would you be interested in playing for the symphony?""

""Sure thing, sounds fun.""

A few nights later he performs with the New York Symphony. The audience is beside themselves by his performance. He is written up in the New York Times and soon becomes the talk of the town. Every night's performance is sold out, and people simply can't stop ranting and raving about how incredible this new violinist is. 

Soon enough, he begins touring the world. One night he performs for Kim Jong Un and Barack Obama. There are both so moved by the performance they hug each other afterwards and proclaim, ""with such beautiful music in the world, it makes no sense that we are fighting with one another."" 

Soon after, he performs in the Middle East, and, similarly, the Jews and Palestinians usher in a call to peace. 

One night after performing in South Africa he hears a knock on his hotel room door. He opens the door and is shocked to find a lion standing in the hallway! 

""Sir,"" the lion says, ""I have heard about your beautiful music bring peace all over the world. I know it's a huge favor to ask, but would it be possible for you to come to the jungle and play for us animals?""

After giving it a bit of thought, he decides that he will. So the man grabs his violin and heads into the jungle. He sits down and begins playing such beautiful music that all the animals gather to hear it. Lions begin hugging zebras, cheetahs hug antelope, etc. Suddenly a huge tiger jumps down from a tree branch and mauls the violinist, killing him instantly.

""Why would you do such a thing?"" The lion yells. ""He was playing such beautiful music for us out of the kindness of his heart!""

The tiger just holds his paw to his hear and asks, ""Eh?""Bear 1: You think that person is full of salmon?

Zubaida Hasan appeared on an episode of Oprah, shortly before she returned to Afghanistan, I think this episode aired in 2004.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo32noBNUWYI think thats one of the most amazing things ive ever seen. Just imagine how uncomfortable that must have been. Great job by the doctors.Massive respect to Dr. Peter Grossman!!!She must have been excited beyond belief when the bandages finally came off. Incredible.Holy shit her face literally melted into her chest...

Glad she was able to find help!

EDIT: her face *appears* to have melted, but it did not. They probably removed damaged tissue and then fused what was left so it could heal, resulting in this appearance.

EDIT 2: or maybe it was acid or maybe I was right the first time or maybe it's something else...y'all are confusing me.I wish I had the power to do that for somebody.Here she is now - 
http://grossmanburnfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-23-at-3.43.57-PM.pngNot gunna lie I just glanced at the before picture and immediately thought it was Sylvester stallone.I couldn't imagine having talent like that where I could change someone's life do dramatically for the better. That's amazing!Now we need to get the tattoo artist who covers burn scars.[deleted]What a beautiful face! [Story](http://grossmanburnfoundation.org/success-stories/zubaida-hasan-a-miracle-story/)[She looks kind of like Anne Frank now.](http://i.imgur.com/4xlpQSt.jpg)does skin really melt like that? her face melted onto her chest? or was that the result of some sort of surgical procedure to protect what was left of her throat?The pain burns cause during and after are the most immense fury of hell you could ever imagine! I wish burns on no one. It's pain that you wouldn't believe is even possible to exist, never mind survivable. The magnitude of burns this woman went through is 50x my own, and all I want to do is congratulate her, hug her, pay her, console her, protect her from any more future pain etc. I cannot imagine what hell she went through and am SO HAPPY to see she looks beautiful post-op :) anyone who experiences burns this extreme in their lifetime honestly deserves nothing but positives and good feelings in their future. [That 'before' picture.](http://i.imgur.com/jt6ljbc.gif)She went from Rocky to AdrienneThis is why I don't mind when vapid people get plastic surgery.  

Advancements on people who have money but don't NEED surgery lead to amazing advancements for people who actually need these treatments to lead a normal life. 

(Edit:Oh my goodness I can taste the hate, and the hate is deliccciouuusss)Looking at the thumbnail, I definitely thought the post would be related to a wax statue of Sylvester Stallone that had melted. 

God damn.holy fucking shit. who is the surgeon?? Michelangelo? this shit is exquisite. Man that's awesome. So very happy for herthat doctor did great work on the young ladyThat's an amazing job. On the left she looks like Sylvester Stallone after a fight, and on the right she looks like a hotter Anne Frank. Props to the surgeon. I actually have a large second/third degree burn on a good portion of my right arm - burns are one of the most painfully excruciating injuries with a very long healing time. Luckily I discovered multiple organizations of burn survivors, these people have gone through so much both physically AND mentally and have come out from this experience as absolutely amazing people. 

However lack of an adequate support system and proper psychological and physical care really stunts the healing process. I had the privilege of attending the World Burn Congress for burn survivors this past October and it was an extremely enlightening experience.  These people are so humble, accepting, kind and wise beyond their years.

At the end of the day, we have to focus on prevention and support to help these people. Look up the Phoenix Society and the Home Sprinkler initiative!!

These scars may not be pretty, but a lot of the time they create a beautiful person inside.

There wasn't. There was a note to parents, but it didn't express anything about gender.
  
But it was cool to see these Legos that haven't been opened since 1981. I mean shit, I was 2-3 when this was on store shelves. The brick walls are thicker than they are today. But the sets today are better by far. AND SPCAE LEGO!!! Shit, that brings me back. I mean, my whole Lego room brings me back, but to see ads in the booklet brings me back.

And you know what? Who gives a shit? When I have the privilege of having kids, Ima teach them to do whatever the fuck they want, but they gotta learn both jobs. My girls will know how to change a tire, and my boys will know how to make bathrooms smell like lemons. Pink Lego, boy Lego, fuck it! Boys play with Barbies, girls play with GI Joe, I'll make fun of them for playing with lame toys, not for playing with the wrong gender toy.
  
The fucking Danish got it right with Lego, and Danishes, and they're right. Who gives a fuck?! Maybe they thought by 1981, when this set was made, that they didn't need to insert pamphlets telling parents to not be assholes. Because rthe Danish weren't assholes in 1981.
  
Lego rules. Build whatever the fuck you wanna build, and don't be a dick parent telling your kids what to build. Fuck you and your dying asshole ways. WHO WANTS TO COME OVER AND DRINK AND BUILD WHATEVER THE FUCK??!?!?!!?
  
edit: you want more pictures of the box? just ask. I'll be up for a while.
  
EDIT: Okay, now I'm awake and sober, and can asses what I have done. The set isn't really that valuable, and I got it as part of a massive 390 set haul last year. I kept it for its historical value. The pieces are bagged in the perforated bags from back in the day, and they make that distinctive sound when you shake them. I love that sound. All I did was cut one of the seals to open it, and I don't regret it. This set is a time capsule and should be opened to see that booklet.
  
EDIT: The pictures of my Lego room were pretty old. Here's my room as of today. http://imgur.com/a/MrlX1[A helpful guide to picking out toys for kids](http://i.imgur.com/tcCnOdV.jpg).SPACESHIP?!??!!??Wish my parents had gotten this memo.  :(  All I wanted was legos and hot wheels and all I got were barbies.Source, but in German:

This is an English version of the 1974 German pamphlet found [here](http://www.redshift.com/~shifflett/lego/German_catalog_1974/). The English cover with the blonde girl can be seen [here](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?C=c74ukhom). The blurry numbers on the bottom match: 97880-Eng. This seems to be associated with the 1970s Lego Homemaker sets, which were Lego's first sets aimed at girls.

Other details: Although the matching German page is the third photo in the link, the position of the staple [confirms it is the back page](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2n1t47/70s_lego_had_the_right_idea/cm9o9wi?context=3). I am still unsure of the ""white house"" that OP mentioned, but perhaps he can corroborate the rest of this.

Edit to add: I found the [Portuguese version](https://plus.google.com/photos/+Blastemes/albums/5668495571434629281?banner=pwa), with [relevant translation of the ""To Parents"" letter.](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/a%20necessidade%20de%20criar%20e%20igualmente%20forte%20em%20todas%20criancas.%20rapazes%20ou%20raparigas.%20o%20que%20interessa%20e%20a%20imaginacao.%20a%20habilidade%20e%20a%20tecnica%20nao%20contam.%20Pode-se%20construir%20o%20que%20se%20tem%20na%20ideia.%20uma%20cama%20ou%20em%20camiao.%20uma%20casa%20de%20boneca%20ou%20uma%20nave%20espacial.%20%0A%0AMuitos%20rapazs%20preferem%20as%20casas%20de%20boneca.%20no%20fim%20de%20contas%20ha%20mais%20pessoas%20do%20que%20astronautas.%20uma%20boa%20parte%20das%20meninas%20prefere%20as%20naves%20espaciais.%20Sao%20mais%20excitantes%20do%20que%20as%20cases%20do%20boneca.%20O%20importante%20e%20porlhes%20ao%20alcance%20o%20material%20exacto.%20so%20assim%20elas%20poderao%20criar.) 
Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this. A Lego designer explains how the company survived: http://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1x6ldp/lego_franchise_infographic/cf8vdl3

Edit: You know, I'm really tired of older former Lego builders claiming Lego didn't produce pre-packaged sets with instructions in ""the good old days."" Unless your ""good old days"" were prior to 1978, those sets you sniff at, the ones that told you how to build spaceships with special parts? They were around: http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/year-1978 

Edit 2: Corrected the first link. http://i.imgur.com/afnTUMC.gifThis sucks balls. I tried to enter a Lego building competition at a local mall. I was a skinny little kid with long blonde hair. They told me that ""girls weren't allowed to enter"". I'm still emotionally damaged from that one, cos I was a Lego master.I'm a girl...and I wanted pink Legos. Why didn't they have pink Legos when I was a kid? Why is that so hard? Can anyone else make out what's written [on the back of the sheet](http://i.imgur.com/y5yLayE.png)?  

All I can make out is:

>The day the ----ier  
>get burnt -----

You're standing in an active minefield and you decide to take a picture for karma?!Not saying it must be the case, but to me it feels like someone just created this himself, but to put a more weight on his moral message he's claiming it's official message from Lego.

Greek student here. If anyone's interested, here's who they are. I should note, however, that the separate divisions of the muses weren't agreed upon till the end of antiquity.

In the center is Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. I'm assuming she's in the middle because they considered epic the highest poetic genre. Below her in the bottom right corner, Cleo, the muse of history. To the left, Urania, muse of astronomy. Then Polyhymnia, the muse of sacred poetry. Then Erato, muse of lyric poetry, specifically love poetry (her name is related to the word ""erotic""). Then Terpsichore, muse of dance and the chorus. Then Melpomene, muse of tragedy. Then Thalia, muse of comedy.  Then Euterpe, muse of elegiac poetry.
It looks like it was buried under white pumice from a volcanic eruption.

>The ancient city of Zeugma was originally founded as a Greek settlement by Seleucus I Nicator, one of the generals of Alexander the Great, in 300 BC. The population of the city at its peak was approximately 80,000 inhabitants.

http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/11/11/mosaics-revealed-at-ancient-greek-city-of-zeugma-in-turkey/I'm surprised by all the sediment/ (for the lack of a better word) stuff that ended up on top of it over the years. Although I know 2,000 years, plus or minus half a millennium, is a lot of time for the accumulation of sediment/stuff to take place, I didn't realize several feet/ meters could pile up that fast. [Touched it up a bit.](http://imgur.com/Z4SbgUO)It makes me so happy to know there are still things in the world to be discovered.I was excited when i tore up a carpet and found a hardwood floor. Now i know that was bush league.Wow, can't imagine the feeling you must get discovering this yourself. HOW CAN IT BE GREEK IF ITS IN TURKEY IM ONTO YOU LIBERALS DONT TRY TO PLAY ME I KNEW A MAPPLEASE dont let ISIS find it...

Edit: ok, folks, I'm not a novice when it comes to geography, history and current events.   I said that because ISIS is right across the border on Syria, and heaven forbid, they make their way into Turkey somehow.   We see Russians in the Ukraine so why is spillover totally impossible?  I mean no offense to Muslims in general, but ISIS has history of destroying works of art, monuments and historical sites in towns it makes a home in.   Man, reddit, you are fickle and easy to insult a total stranger.   First time I've been called a ""knuckle dragging mouth breather"".

Edit #2:  Alright, let me justify the comment/joke behind what I said.  Current (2 week old information) shows that [ISIS holds the boarder area of Turkey in Syria and the northern end of Iraq.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html?_r=0).  [That's about 25 miles/40 km](http://imgur.com/E1PqDqE) to the site where that mosaic is being uncovered...Not really far.  Of course its a stretch to say ISIS will invade Turkey anytime soon.  But sheesh man, they're right there at the doorstep.  Chill out people.This will probably get buried but I work for the Biblical Archaeology Society and we did a short piece on this last week. This is from Zeugma, an ancient trading center that was the only point traders and travelers could cross the Euphrates. The name literally means ""bridge"". In the 90s turkey built a dam farther down the river and submerged 30% of the site underwater. They've been excavating since 2000 and this is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. I think it's worth pointing out that these mosaics actually date to the 2nd or 3rd cent. A.D., so at a glance, they are about 1,750 to 1,850 years old, rather than 2,200, as has been reported in the media.
([Here is a good source](http://www.ccaroma.org/en/zeugma-conservation-mosaics) for more reliable info, if anyone's interested.)

There were definitely some very stunning and intricate polychrome mosaics in the Hellenistic period; it might even be considered the height of the craft.  But there are some stylistic differences that set the later mosaics apart.  That includes things like the heavy borders, the interlocking geometric patterns, the use of large(-ish) tesserae, the heavily rounded and shaded facial features, etc.
You can compare them, for example, to [these other 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics](http://followinghadrian.com/2014/10/15/roman-mosaics-from-the-national-archaeological-museum-of-spain-madrid/) from Spain.

Interestingly, it's thought that the interlocking geometric 'panel' designs in some mosaics might have been designed to imitate the elaborate panelling of the ceilings in the rooms where they were laid.

Gorgeous mosaics!  So nice to see that they've been spared the flooding that's overtaken so much of the site.

[Edit]  P.S. Also note some of the qualities I listed for 2nd - 3rd c. A.D. mosaics are common to Hellenistic mosaics, too (compare the Zeugma pavements to the [Alexander Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#mediaviewer/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) from Pompeii, for example (ca. 100 B.C.).  An art historian can probably add to this better than I can, but some of the differences are kind of ineffable to pin down.Oh man, crosspost over to /r/AncientCivilizations, they'd love this!They used sealer.awesomeIn Gaziantep, the closest major city to the archeological site, there's a state of the art ""mosaic museum"" that showcases finds from Zeugma. 

I was there a few months ago and had a blast. Southeastern Turkey is completely safe and refreshingly light on on other tourists, making you the recipient of a lot of warm hospitality from the locals.

Comment thread in the Dutch subreddit[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2nv3gx/you_will_not_be_arrested_for_using_drugs_in/) Avoid the classic Pulp Fiction situation. As a graphic designer, I love how practically everything in the Netherlands is professionally designed. Isn't it usually possession that's illegal, not the actual consumption?In Australia, at school and university I was always reminded that no matter what the person has ingested, legal or not; it is always safe for them to ring an ambulance. They will only ring the police if there is a dangerous and violent situation.

Paramedics are there to save your life, not to criminally charge you.Little story about some of the victims involved in this.

2 British tourists collapsed on the street after buying and using cocaine that turned out to be white heroin sold as cocaine, both got brought to a hospital. 

After they get some medication one of them decides he feels fine and bails. When the hospital staff realizes he's gone they inform the police who eventually track him down that same night, he was quite easy to spot since the first responders cut open his clothes to get to his chest and he was wearing those clothes. 

He refuses to go back to the hospital, the police have no choice but to detain him and put him in a temporary holding cell where they continuously check on him to make sure he's ok. I don't know the exact details on this but he stops breathing/heart stops, the EMT starts CPR. Gets picked up by an ambulance and dies on his way to the hospital.

Meanwhile, at pretty much the exact moment the other guy stops breathing too and survives because he decided to remain in the hospital.

TL;DR: 2 tourists use white heroin thinking it was cocaine, one of them dies after leaving the hospital and the other lives.That's a PSA you will never find in the USA. Where in the world do you get arrested after going to the hospital for an OD?The red-light district in Amsterdam has some pretty dodgy characters. I found the tip is to never stop moving, do not even acknowledge the existence of people trying to sell you things and above all do not show how stoned/drunk you are.

http://imgur.com/l9dmmQ0There's electronic signs all over the busy tourist spots conveying the same message. It's quite comical sometimes how dealers approach you so openly around the common bar areas like Rembrandtplein.Its amazing to see that they actually care and not just let drug users die.Here is a little story from personal experience if you feel like reading something. I currently work in the caregiver field for developmentally disabled adults. Upon starting the job, you find out that the mental illnesses you're dealing with are really just the extreme end of a spectrum that a lot of totally normal people with high IQs are also on. They're really not that different from us besides the fact that for a lot of conditions, their brain cannot resist the urge to do something even when it knows it's wrong. We can know better and learn and resist urges but no matter how many times I teach a client something, when the situation comes back up, the chances of them retaining the knowledge are unfortunately pretty low (but not impossible). With that being said, the following story is about someone with dev. disabilities, but the reactions their brain are having to the events in the story are totally normal and something that we all experience.

You quickly realize that the #1 trick to stopping acts of defiance in your client is to not give them something to defy.

For example we have one girl with oppositional defiance disorder. There is a set time for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, snack in that order. She constantly will cause a scene or have a documented behavior because she wants food at the times that aren't set for food.

Now she is an adult, and she should be allowed to have food any time, but we realized that it wasn't even about eating, it was that she HAD to break the rules. There was something about a rule for her that caused her to want nothing more than to overcome it and break the rule. It has a lot more to do with wanting personal control over your own life, but we call it the forbidden fruit effect.

So we solved her issue by taking away all snack times, dinner times, lunch times, breakfast times, and letting her tell us when she wanted to eat. When she wanted a 3rd or 4th snack we gave it to her. We weighed her after a week and she had gained 10 pounds in literally 1 week.

She was very upset and we explained to her the natural consequences of eating too much. We taught her how to eat healthy and feel healthy. We told her she can still eat whatever whenever she wants.

""No I want to eat healthy, I don't want to be fat.""

From then on she asks for one snack or no snack after dinner. She doesn't go crazy anymore trying to get food at times that she isn't supposed to have it because we totally took away the whole matrix of scheduled times and calories and all that stuff. We took away all of the rules to break and replaced it total freedom coupled with personal accountability.

I really believe a lot of the things people do, especially teenagers, are done 10x more because you're told not to do them. No one wants to be told by another human being with just as many flaws and shortcomings as them that they're not responsible enough to handle their own shit around some food or a drug or whatever else it is that's being forbidden.

**TL;DR A recount from an experience I had working with those with developmental disabilities that relates to the whole idea of the forbidden fruit effect. We took a girl with oppositional defiance disorder who consistently wanted to defy all the house rules and removed every rule and let her control her own life, but showed her the natural results of eating too much or not being responsible. She learned that being in control means it's on her and no one else to make the right choices, and she started making them.**[Gotta love Hamsterdam.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOHkrZECnfs)at night there is a LOT of coke dealers in the streets of amsterdam, most of them African (as in, actually recently from africa) ","{'Sadness': 0.059729, 'Emotional_Range': 0.795, 'Tentative': 0.112, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.961212, 'Analytical': 0.723, 'Conscientiousness': 0.079, 'Agreeableness': 0.681, 'Joy': 0.057378, 'Disgust': 0.117224, 'Extraversion': 0.761, 'Openness': 0.261, 'Anger': 0.941726}",{'sign': 0.377541}

The City of Boston claims a 60% reduction in power consumption and full replacement paying of in just 2-3 years.  Fantastic program.The light pollution effect is *very* evident in this picture.  Notice the foliage between the lamps on either side--the traditional lighting shows an orange bleed for the entire area, yet the trees between the LED lamps are almost completely unilluminated.Those orange lights sure are going to be nostalgic in 20 years...Which city is this?From this angle, the LED lamp posts look to be more efficiently directing the light. Compared to the conventional post which appears to be shining light everywhere with limited efficiency. Unless there is a great deal of reflection of light from the pavement, I'd say that light pollution is less likely. The way I understand it, LED's are more directional that conventional light bulbs. But that's only my opinion.LED looks much more natural. I hate the orange street lights. Always have. Wish this was happening on my street!/r/darksky would like this.depends on the white balance on your camera tooThey started this in my city, and I'm actually not a fan of it.

I travel on a highway to work almost every day. The lamp posts are more spaced apart and much higher up than in this picture, so the light is less concentrated and the dark spots you see in this photo are much larger. 

The orange street lights spread the light out better and didn't leave dark patches like the LED's did. The LED's are worse during the winter as well because they are much dimmer in my city than in this picture. The orange lights help distinguish definition on the road much better, but with the LED street lights, its harder to tell where icy/deep snow patches might be.

These would be a great for city driving where the posts are usually shorter and closer together and would illuminate the street as well as it does in this picture, but for highway and winter driving, the orange is better.

But that's just my opinionI, personally, prefer warmer colored lights.They did this to my street sometime around 3 weeks ago. It only really decreases light pollution above lamp level. You know, reduces the pink sky effect. 

The HUGE downside is that the inside of my house looks like daytime now. And the light is blue. Blue = bad at night (thanks f.lux). 

I used to be able to sleep with my curtains open. White curtains. I hadn't slept well in a week, and had one of those aha moments when you're lying in bed at 2am, curtains closed, looking at the ceiling and thinking holy crap its bright blue in here, with the curtains closed, its bright as hell. 

Replaced my white curtains with red ones to mute out the blue, and now I'm fine. Then I think, how many people will lose sleep like me, and not realize the issue, and then wake up and screw my commute by driving tired and getting into accidents. 


And also, why couldn't the get a warmer colour temp for the LED's? Blue sucks, at least give me yellow or something. These new lights have been attracting the gypsy moths back

Wanna put shout out to r/invasivespecies for the info!I have no source for this, just something that I heard, but apparently there is some question over the long term health effects that replacing the sodium lamps will have. The white LEDs simulate sunlight, whereas the sodium lamps are more similar to candlelight in terms of coloring. I guess there is some discussion over whether or not this shift will disrupt the natural sleep cycles of people walking around at night, or even having this light shining in through their windows. 

On a small scale, the shift is not expected to be bad, but if they were to replace every street lamp, apparently there might be some problems. 

Anyone care to verify or dispute these claims? Idk if OP knows but the LED lamps probably look better in this picture because of the white balance setting on the camera that captured this shot. Maybe I'm nitpicking though.Chicago resident here... They have been slowly replacing the old street lights the the new LED bulbs over the past few years in our glorious city. They got to our street last fall and once the polar vortex struck with its powerful might we noticed the streets were dark at night. The new bulbs couldn't melt the snow and ice off the lamps like they use to!! They actually had crew go around and knock the buildup off. Thanks Obama!Replacing sodium vapor lamps with white LEDs as street lights is a good plan, but not a great one.  I think that replacing them with red or orange LEDs would have been a much better idea, since you still need your night vision once you leave that road that looks like it's lit by the sun.I hate the cold white of the LED street lamps... I liked my warm orange glow =(It's worth noting the Hwite balance of the photo is set to the temperature of the LED lights so it makes the Tungsten lights look like shit; not a really fair photography.

[A photograph I took for Instance](http://i.imgur.com/u5JREM5.jpg), the camera White Balance was set for the Tungsten lights up front, the halogen around the side as a result turned a a very noticeable Green color in the photography; with the naked eye the lights looked the same.I wish they'd tint them orange. It's easier on the eyes for night driving I thought. (Other than that the old ones were naturally reddish).That tall building in the background has a faceThe building almost directly centre looks so happy.Random note - the yellow/orange lights actually produce more lumens (more light) per bulb, but due to the light being more omni-directional and having a bad color-rendering index, to humans the LEDs appear like a much better light. This looked so Korean, so I zoomed in and found that it was Korea.LEDs are a complicated issue. They save energy but the cheapest kind emit blue-rich light which simulate the daylight which can be harmful to humans and animals alike. The rule to remember is to use red light at night. Just the other day, LEDs received a Nobel Prize. You can read about how that might affect dark skies and light pollution [here](http://darksky.org/night-sky-conservation/421).

[It looked like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Comptometer_model_E.png), but the copper body was pretty heavily tarnished and almost black like a really old worn penny. However, it still worked. After taking everything apart (there were hundreds of individual parts: springs, levers, gears, etc.), lubricating everything and polishing the copper shell it looked even better than the photo above, like a shiny new penny. It was incredibly impressive to see how such a complex device was put together (and very satisfying to be able to take it apart and put it back together without screwing it up!). I took photos of the inside, which I don't have access to right now, but [here's an internet pic of the inside with the shell taken off](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/08/comptometer_interior.jpg).

As a nurse I work with a lot of patients who are terminally ill and frequently I'll ask them what were the most memorable moments in their life. 9/10 times people will mention family or memorable moments like these. Never once have I had a patient mention money or personal possessions as the highlight of their life.

His bed was set up in the sitting room, his view out the window was onto the mountain range in our area. He woke up to the sun rising every morning over it. During the day and in the evenings his bed was wheeled out into the kitchen so he could be there with his family and be beside the stove. He could lie there and look out the double doors onto the bay. The view from the kitchen over the bay is unbelievable, many people at the funeral in the house were amazed at it. 
Before his remains left the house to go to the church we faced him towards the sea one last time. Something I believe would have put a smile on his face. Happy watFuck yeah grandson! Not only are you sharing that fantastic day with her, and making her final desires a reality, you are there. And her face shows the joy and wonder of the setting and experience with you! 

To this day I regret missing my stepfathers final days, due to work commitments and travel constraints. All in all bullshit rationalizations. I just missed his death by @ 6 hours. Regret not being there just to say goodbye, hold his hand and thank him for everything he was to me. So kudos, it's hard to watch it happen, but being there for our loved ones is soul work. It is our responsibility and great honor to help them pass from this world to...

I'm a geriatric nurse and its sad the number of elderly people who don't have family or don't have family who care enough to do things like this for them. You guys are awesome :)Op, was that wheelchair rented or how did you find it?  I may be trying to take my mother-in-law to see the beach for the first time next year and worry about her walking on the sand.

Thanks.

She said that no one ever climbed Mount Fuji because Dragon ate them.

NeatIce.... Cave... under a Volcano?... sounds like a death trap.This reminded me there was some pseudo-scence attempt in some website somewhere to explain how dragons would be and they were apparently made of carbon fiber that would allow them to have hollow bones like birds, so they'd be light without losing durability to allow flying. They'd have a sack of methane or some gas in their stomach which they would spark with a specialized lighter-like organ in their throat that would allow it to breathe fire.

All the luck in the world to the brave people of Hong Kong. For those who aren't aware of what's happening there right now:

[""Occupy Central With Peace and Love, as the protest is officially known, aims to foment democratic change by paralyzing the heart of this freewheeling financial hub. It was originally slated to begin Wednesday, but an aligned student demonstration Friday gathered such momentum that its leaders brought the launch forward.""](http://time.com/3439242/hong-kong-democracy-china-ocuppy-central/)I was born in Hong Kong and my family moved overseas when I was a child. For many years I have always hated hong kong: I hated the apathy, I hated the materialism, I hated the fact that all everyone talked about is money. I moved back there a few times and every time I would find an excuse to leave as that culture of no one caring about anything but themselves got too much for me to take.

I am now studying in the US and every time I see a photo like this, it brings tears to my eyes. The students proved the future of Hong Kong is not selfish, it is not apolitical, and it is willing to fight with each other for a better future. We do not want to break from China, we just want to protect our way of life that we can see disappearing bit by bit, year after year. We are sick of a puppet government bending to the will of China and tycoons, ignoring the plight of ordinary HK residents. I am even more proud knowing that most people there are aware of the potential consequences of the police, or even the army being sent to handle them, and that they will likely lose. But they are still there, occupying the streets, helping each other, staying peaceful, even cleaning the streets, for fuck's sake. I have never been as proud to be  HKer and never been sadder to be away. Now this is how you protest. Hats off to the protesters. Hong Kong is spotless. No looting, no damaged property. This is how to do a protest. The Hong Kong protest should not be compared with the Occupy movement.

The Hong Kong protest is about the people wanting Universal Suffrage - the right to vote through a real democratic process and not some state selected candidates which is achievable through electoral reform.

The Occupy movement is about a protest against social and economic inequality which happens not just in the US but also around the world. This is why the movement failed because this is highly unachievable goal.Taiwan here, wish HK the best of luck.I love seeing this.Whenever I see pictures like that, I get pee anxiety.  Man, what would I have to do if I had to go?  I'd never find a bathroom in time.Does anybody have tl;dr: of what is going on there?I'm surprised nobody brought a beach ball5000 protesters according to the authorities https://www.reddit.com/live/tnc30xhiiqom

live thread about thisImagine if Hong Kong was able to separate from China 100%. Too bad that would never be allowed to happen :CThis is not going to end well. I don't see China making any concessions. The CCP rules with an iron fist over many autonomous regions such as xinjiang, tibet, inner mongolia. If they were to give an inch, it would affect all those regions plus maybe Taiwan. Hong Kong has to deal with the fact that it is part of China now and the pseudo autonomy they have will disappear officially in 2047. hopefully by then, the CCP will be more open and democratic. I've been there. That is a crazy amount of people even for HK. I imagine this is Hong Kong on a day by day basisI wish them the best of luck, hope they get what they want Anyone know current participation estimates *not* from the police?They should use the US Constitution as a base but they should outlaw lobbists, campaign donations and to be a citizen your parents have to be citizens (starting the after the Constitution is implemented) so they don't have created citizenship. First World Problem: I really want to be a part of something that will revolutionize my country, but we already have a democratic government , free k-12 Education, universal healthcare, subsidized post secondary education and fairly low corruption and high transparency.  
TL;DR There is not much left to fight for in Canada. [China](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-29405747) are telling their people it is an illegal uprising by students. That a minority are forcing them to do it and they gave the authorities no choice but to reluctantly use tear gas. 
Where do people go to the bathroom in situations like this?What an ironic name. The American Occupy movement was not a ""pro-democracy"" movement. It's hard to say what it was about due to its complete lack of focus, but primarily it was an anti-economic disparity movement. In fact, by the end it had been completely coopted by pro-communist organizations.

This seems like a very specific, very focused protest with clear goals. Putting the ""occupy"" label on it just makes it seem like something about that label was lost in translation.I know this is a serious situation and I really respect those demonstrators for standing up for their rights.

But I can't help but feel an odd twinge of that odd ""I've been there"" feeling because I've spent countless hours playing Sleeping Dogs.

Edit: I'm dumb, the front is bigger than the hole.Sure, I'll just bludgeon these logs into firewood. The technical term for an axe handle is haft, not shaft.  While shaft can be applied loosely, it's like calling a joist a piece of wood.

Now, literally 5.5 millennia later, other humans find it.  There's a clear linkage, in the form of that axe, between they that found it and they that made it.TIL the Stone Age was only 5500 years ago. I seriously thought it was like a million years ago. I really need to read up on prehistory.Wow ! Axe is impressive but an intact wood shaft that is 5500 years old?? Priceless!This appears to be a nephrite (jade) ax head, it could also be chalcedony (jasper, agate).  Either stone type would be shaped by grinding, rather than chipping and flaking like flint would be.

Jade is a fairly soft stone, it seems like an odd choice for an ax.  But jade is *incredibly* resistant to breakage.  A fresh flint blade is as sharp as a surgeon's scalpel, but a single strike onto a tree trunk would dull it, and it could shatter completely.  Jade won't take an edge like flint, but it is easy to hone the edge on a bit of sandstone, and it won't break. This resistance to breakage, and ease of grinding, is one of the reasons that jade can be carved into such intricate shapes without shattering. Looks like something out of The Flintstones.Looks like they found it when someone broke off the handle.

Something that amazed me while visiting America as a european was the Fauna. 

In my country the only chance you'll get at seeing a live deer would be to have a house in the countryside, far from roads, wake up at 5 in the morning, find a random spot near a lake to stay at, freeze your ass off waiting for something living to pass by, finally see a deer approach, deer will see you before you see him, it gets immediately startled and runs off.

In america I literally saw a dude in the suburbs, watering his garden  plants, kids running around, fawn in the same garden, close to a tree, with a doe eating the watered grass.

I  saw so many animals, buffalo, deers, elks, wolves, bears I didn't gave a shit anymore, those motherfuckers only blocked the road and wouldn't run off despite me being the top of the food chain !

Edit : thanks to /u/jhnhines I now know buffalo in plural isn't ""buffaloes""I drove through yelowstone.

Was odd for me to see bison up close. Their eye balls bounce with every step they make.

Also I didn't know female bison had horns. I though it was odd when the babies were nursing There were once as many as 30 million of these creatures roaming freely.  One herd witnessed by early pioneers was said to be 10 miles wide by 50 miles long and took 3 days to pass by. About 4,200 bison in 2.2 million acres and they still somehow manage to block the main roads every day. 


P.S. Not that I'm complaining, just some interesting numbers. It was really cool to see scenes like this when I visited the park for the first time a few months back. In the park, we call this a ""bison jam"". As a tour guide, one of my favorite jokes was that I much preferred boysenberry.I bet this makes a great sound.DO THE JINGLE! DO THE JINGLE!This is no joke. I worked there during the summer as a room attendant and frequently would have to wait for Bison to move away from the doors of people's cabins so I could clean them. They also say give yourself an extra 20 minutes of drive time to account for Bison traffic.Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.and there's always that one fucker milling around, blocking the road, no idea where to be.There was a small stampede of about 50 bison when I was there a few years ago. Some guy tried to drive through it; that didn't work so well. That's how I learned bison always have the right of way. I absolutely fucking LOVE Yellowstone.

Favorite place on Earth.I worked in Yellowstone one summer. The best days were when our van would get stuck in a buffalo jam and we'd get paid just to screw around and watch bison and tourists. Holy shit that's terrifying.That's a steaming load of bull right there.Word of advice from someone that has bison on their farm currently. DO NOT FUCK WITH BUFFALO. They are fast as fuck and don't give two shits. My dad is a park ranger at YNP, and one of his regular duties is doing ""bison patrol,"" which the park rangers refer to as ""human patrol"" aka: ""keep the humans from getting too close to the bison."" I like bison...I like fog...not sure if putting them together was nightmare fuel or not...will update.If you've never seen a buffalo up close, let me tell you something.

They're fucking scary.

A few years back my family went camping up in the Badlands in South Dakota. I basically got trapped for a good hour in the general store because a herd of those fuckers decided to make camp right outside, and if anyone went near them, they'd fucking charge. I also got yelled at by an old guy because some random kids decided to approach the buffalo, and apparently I was the only female in range, hence they were my kids.

Fuck buffalo, man.bye son
Looks mythicalBison are fucking badass. They just so casually do whatever the hell they want. Thought they were awesome when I saw some at Yellowstone. There was one that was eating some grass on the side of the highway, and cars were slowing down and carefully going around him. He just gave no fucks, was just like, ""Fuck you, I'm a motherfucking BISON.""Actually, the traffic is behind the camera. It is the 1315 people who pulled over because someone else pulled over to get something out of the trunk and made everyone think he was looking at an animal, so now a half a fuck ton of people are peering into the brush.

Once they see the bison on the road, at least a quarter of the people are going to ignore rules and good sense and get way too close to the bison.[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)","{'Sadness': 0.043387, 'Emotional_Range': 0.811, 'Tentative': 0.715, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.520477, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.111, 'Agreeableness': 0.589, 'Joy': 0.052157, 'Disgust': 0.803737, 'Extraversion': 0.664, 'Openness': 0.257, 'Anger': 0.856936}","{'abstract': 0.354344, 'tree': 0.668188, 'winter': 0.377541, 'forest': 0.28905, 'snow': 0.310026, 'curtain': 0.28905}"

Rammstein comes to town, and the place is booked with people in various displays of bondage gear, gas masks, and metal sticking out of every orifice of their body. I strapped in for what I thought was going to be a rough night after the show ended and I had 200+ rooms of fans amped from the show. 

It was one of the best nights I had working. Every single fan was polite, courteous to the other guests, and just happy they saw their favorite band play. It must have been the only night I didn't get a noise complaint.

On the other hand, I had to call the police 3 times after a Bob Seger concert due to fights in the lobby...[deleted]I have seen them several times, most amazing thing I've ever seen.

Woodstock 99 had a third of this, if not less people and it was riddled with problems.  I'm just wondering if things are done differently there, if there's just a different concert going culture, or if similar problems occur with crowds this large.

They protect you. They babysit your kids. They miss you when you're gone. They mourn you when you die. They sit with you when you're sick. They have been known to find their way home when lost. They bring you stuff. They lick your face even when you are dirty or smelly. They ride in a car or a boat or a plane with you. They keep old people company. They obey commands. And some will fight to the death to save you. And they'll comfort you when you're down and cuddle up next to you in bed. Dogs, you get all the reddit gold. I just really love this picture. Its so beautiful. 

I met a couple that have raised dogs together probably for at least the last 20 years. They're really active and often go on long walks and hikes around their home (they live in Switzerland). They had this one dog (a mixed Swiss breed) named Cindy they got from a farmer. Cindy had 6 puppies and the couple gave the puppies away to friends and family apart from 1 which they kept and named Calimero or Cali for short. Anyway, Cindy got really sick around 12 years or so and had to be put down. The couple lived on an acre and a half of land and buried the Cindy on their property. Now usually, the couple would let their dogs go out in the evening so they could do their business. They were very well trained and the dogs always came back when they were ready (after about ten minutes or so). Soon after Cindy had passed, the couple noticed that Cali would leave for longer periods of time, at least 30 minutes or so. One night it was lightly snowing so the husband followed Cali's footprints and found Cali at his mom's (Cindy's) grave. He was just walking around the grave sniffing. This picture reminded me of this. Very sweetI regret not taking a picture with my cat when I was younger. Got her when I was 4. Im 21 now and she's still around but I can't have a photo comparison like that now

There's really no evidence he ever came back. That's a picture I'd like to see though.By induction, the previous graffiti was removed by a pair of sadomasochistic rabbits.

I was wondering why did Make a wish foundation gave a bald man a kid with Spock ears to hug. Hi I'm a Make-a-Wish Wish Grantor! Let me answer some popular questions for you regarding MAW and what we do!

We give kids with **LIFE THREATENING** conditions a wish for something, anything, they could possibly want.

It can be something to have, something to help, something to do, somewhere to go, someone to be, etc. If it is the deepest, truest, thing the child wants, we do everything we can to make it so!

I encourage all of you to go check out make-a-wish, and if you want, to donate either some time, or some money, as we are continually granting wishes for kids.

Last note: Each child's wish costs, on average, $5,000-$10,000 (usually around the $7,500 mark). So a lot goes into these things!

Thanks and take care!

Edit: it doesn't have to always be cancer, a very popular 'qualifier' is muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.

Edit 2: Thanks for the PM, I'm not a former Wish Kid - I'm just a 28 year old male trying to learn to a little about humility. It's hard to think about yourself when you are sitting with a 5 year old in a hospital that he hasn't left for months talking about him running around and playing with his younger brother.

Also, I want a pizza from that :)What's the big deal about Italian wood?It seriously has to be 200 degrees inside there.When a food truck is essentially a fully kitted out restaurant kitchen, hasn't something been lost?

It's hard to explain - but somehow it feels like it's got a bit too serious. A bit too 'big' and 'professional'.  I feel like we might be at the start of a food truck size and feature arms race, where the focus on the little guy in the crappy truck but with the great food might fall by the wayside.

For example, street food is what it is because traditionally it was designed to be made within the limitations of cooking it on the street.  Simply serving food on the street doesn't really make it 'real' street food, in my opinion.

I get why this truck is cool in itself, but if this is the way food trucks end up going I think something special will be lost.The legitimate ""food truck"" guy at a construction site somewhere in east Los Angeles  is probably thinking ""so, you couldn't afford a brick and mortar restaurant?

Don't want to see your kids get hurt or worse.It's easy to say ""time to move to toddler bed"" when you haven't been through this.

I had one that climbed out of the crib lowest setting, and walked, at 10 months.  It wasn't safe, she was a wanderer too, found her asleep on the steps once, under my bed once.  Child got into everything.  

Crib tent was great, she learned to unzip it right away but diaper pinned the zipper on the outside, bought us some time until she could understand to stay put better.

Put her sleepers on backwards with the zipper pinned up too after she started taking them off and stripping.  One time she got up before me, explored her dirty diaper while in the crib, ooh finger paint.  It's how she got the nickname Pie (poo in ears).

She's 23 now, a very creative soul and adventurous woman.

You do what you have to do to make things safe and get through it.

But, what are the odds they have a spare spare tire?I live in Atlanta. Can confirm the proliferation of Wranglers with lift kits and giant tires.  Most Wrangler owners here never take them anywhere but paved roads but I had an old coworker with a Jeepenstein who did some serious rock climbing. He actually had airtools and a welder on board the Jeep for fixing underbody stuff that broke on the trail.  Once he got booted for parking on the curb (tires actually on top of curb) and he just cut the boot off with a grinder and welder and drove off like it was no big deal. I assume this was to prevent him from just putting on his full sized spare that he has on the back.Jeeps are not meant to be kept pristine.  TIL that Americans calls car clamps ""boots"". Those boots look like the kind people put on their personal vehicles to prevent the car from being stolen.  The wheel hubs aren't covered and the driver could just come back with his original wheels and drive away.

More info can be found at  emptytheshelter.org. 

This is either really uplifting or really horrifying. I read about the article in the news a few weeks ago, and decided that I would participate in this.  Lo and behold, my adoption fees were only $10 per cat, much to my joy.  So I now have Lucy and Ethel Meowman whom both are spayed, current on shots and very healthy.  Great value considering the cost involved to get them to this state.



I am a firm believer in adopting pound pets, as they make the best ones.

TL;DR:  I adopted two kittens and it's the best thing ever.That poor spray canister must be utterly distraught at not finding a home :-( Sounds like adoptions went through the woof.Was very happy when I saw the the title and picture. Unfortunately went on to read comments and then became sad and worried for those animals.

 Then, I  remembered how poor my family was. Not in poverty but definitely poor and in the lower economic class. Yet my Mom would still take in every stray dog or cat that came our way. Sure, their cat/dog food was heavily supplemented with our scraps to make it stretch further but at the end of the day they received food, fresh water, and love every day. If we needed vet services, we would go and worry about payment later. Most vets offered us huge discounts and/or payment plans and we were able to pay them even if it took longer than other people. We had all of those animals for years, most dying of old age.  

Remembering this made me feel better. Mom would have been stood in line for one of these animals. Yes, because it was free but also because she had so much love to give. Maybe there were asshats who stood in line for a free pet with cruel intentions. But maybe there were also kindhearted people with little money but lots of love to give, who will take care of their pets like my mother did. These animals at least had a chance at being adopted by the latter rather than face certain death if not adopted.That is the coolest thing i have seen all day!My issue with adoptions has never been the money but the long drawn out process that only happens on the adoption center's time. 

I tired to adopt a guinea pig from a shelter years ago. I was living in the basement of a single family home but my living there was autonomous. The center wanted every person living in the house to come in to visit with the guinea pig during work hours, like we don't have jobs, like anyone else in the house was going to give a shit about my one guinea pig. They then wanted to do a home visit/ interview, again, with everyone living in the house present, during work hours. 

I adopted one from Petsmart instead, in which I ask ""do you have any up for adoption?"" ""Why yes, this one right here, would you like to hold him?"" ""I'll take him home now!"" ""That'll be $35 and sign here."" Done and out in 15 minutes. I had that guinea pig for 9 years. *A 9 year old guinea pig guys!*

So it makes me wonder how many other pets lost out on perfectly good homes because of the overly strict adoption processes [of that particular shelter.] 

I looked for years for a Boston Terrier to adopt. Couldn't find one breeder/ adoptable bossy within a 4 hour drive (I don't have a car) so I bought one. No regrets there. My other dogs have all been adopted directly from previous owners. 

My gf adopted a cat from the local shelter. And they just flat out LIED about every aspect of that thing's health. I sat right there and listened to the woman tell us all of kitty's ailments had been cured and that she was perfectly healthy. We take her to the family vet, she's got everything she was initially diagnosed with that was left almost completely untreated, and then some. So now my gf is stuck with a sick cat that she does NOT have the money to front all at once to fix; she thought she was getting a healthy cat, like they told us, not one that was on death's doorstep. When we called back and talked to the shelter, their response was basically ""tough titties, either bring her back so we can put her down or deal with it."" We didn't want to give her back, we just wanted them to cover the treatments that they'd lied to us and told us they treated. Had they not lied, we might not have even cared. 

I've just been so turned off by every experience I've had with every adoption center. I still believe in adoption but I just won't go through those channels. took reddit all of 5 hours to turn this into a thread about animal abuse.Debbie Downer here.  I just hope they background checked the adoptive families.  Back where I used to live in East Oakland people used to get animals off Craigslist for bait animals.  Many dead puppies and kittens dumped mauled and dead behind the Oakland coliseum or just on the street.My adopted pit sends it's best.I wonder if people only adopt a dog when it's free, will they take care of them if they get ill and need to go to the vet, or will they just get rid of them as soon as they cost too much money...i love the thought of all those dogs finally in homes!! i hope they all have long happy lives with good humans.I work at an animal shelter, reading the comments people seem concerned that the dogs are going to a good home. Each shelter runs differently, however we do a background check which includes, if you rent, calling your landlord, and if you've had pets in the past, calling your vet to verify the animals were taken care of. We're overloaded with cats and doing a waived cat fee, but they're mostly still here. I'm so happy your shelter got so much attention and all the dogs have homes! What a wonderful (and quiet) sight!\o/  I've never been so happy to not see puppies!This is the first time an empty room made me happy. My shelter? Kills every dog someone isn't willing to pay $500 for and have someone stop by their house for the next 3 years.

It's just easier (and cheaper in most cases) to go buy a puppy, it's a headache through adoption and most end up regretting it.

Broken systems, broken systems everywhere.I worry so about giving pets away for free because it makes it so easy for people to take them for nefarious purposes like training fighting dogs and feeding large snakes.  Surprised at all the negative comments on this post. People will jump at the chance to bitch about anything I guess! I'm happy these dogs found a home. :)Maybe they did some promotion and that got attention, so much negative comments here! You upvoted a picture of an empty room. You people are really impressionable.That is really cool. 

The shelter in my city did an 80% off all dogs recently. They didn't quite empty the shelter, unfortunately they were actually over capacity by a ton before the sale. But it did reduce the numbers by a lot. 

You mean to say you usually have to pay to adopt a dog from a shelter?I worked in a shelter and we were forced to start having free cat adoptions because we had 250+ cats and kittens but no one wanted anything but kittens and most of our kittens were still suckling. It was either free adoption fee or euthanize the animals. Now even though the fee was waived, the potential adopters still had to fill out the same questionnaires and go through the same process any other adopter would. Sure some people are still bad owners and some will give the animals up but they do that anyways and we saw no increase in cat intakes just because more people were adopting them. My guess is they were so full it came down to waived adoption fee or dead dogs. Waived fees are a great way to put spayed/neutered animals in people's hands as well as to prevent euthanasia rates. My guess is that a little less than a third of those animals will be returned. Some aren't house trained, some chew shoes, some don't get along with other animals. That's normal for a dog, but when people don't know how to train their animal the behavior gets worse and the dog is returned.

This is why you should ALWAYS adopt and you should always have your pets spayed or neutered. Because there will always be shelters full of animals.","{'Sadness': 0.066357, 'Emotional_Range': 0.883, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.006, 'Fear': 0.046661, 'Analytical': 0.37, 'Conscientiousness': 0.092, 'Agreeableness': 0.78, 'Joy': 0.07036, 'Disgust': 0.137005, 'Extraversion': 0.739, 'Openness': 0.177, 'Anger': 1.0}",{}

The day before one of the Presidential limos was brought in and guarded by the Secret Service at a local fire station.  My friend's dad worked there and arranged for us neighborhood kids to get to see it.  They let us try to open and close the doors (hard for a kid around 14) and let us sit in the back where the President would be sitting the next day.

I had the opportunity to drive a similarly armored Cadillac in a motorcade through downtown D.C. while training with the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service.

The windows rolled up and down and actuated just like the windows on a stock Cadillac, except they were twice as thick as a deck of cards.  The first thing you notice sitting inside is that *everything* is **thicker.**  The pillars, the dashboard, *everything.*  Driving it, it felt very, very heavy.  At the same time though, the engine is...enhanced, as is the suspension, and (this is what *really* amazed me) despite feeling extremely heavy, the car still responds to your input about as well as a Crown Victoria Interceptor.  The weight helps when cornering, but the understeer I expected wasn't there at all.  Jumping lanes on 395 was a breeze, and the acceleration was phenomenal.  I guess you get what you pay for...when you pay $1.5 million for a car.The queen's bently has a roof raised three inches so she can wear hats.I think that car can whitstand RPG hits.

I was snorkeling in the Caribbean and a huge school of fish started ""shoaling"" around me. There I was, in the middle of this dense ball of fish and couldn't see anything but a million fish eyes swirling around me with a vibration that was utterly terrifying. After a few seconds they were gone... zig-zagging about through the lagoon... I left the lagoon in awe of mother nature, feeling like I had an experience beyond life itself. I was quick to tell the person we were staying with, the experienced diver who lent me his gear.

He asked ""did you see anything else?""
Me ""nope""

Later I found out that one of the reasons fish ""shoal"""" is for defensive purposes. There was most likely a shark near and that they are VERY common in those waters...

It burned at around 7-8am on Friday morning and was totally worth staying up for.

This is called ""the Embrace"" and it was one of the most remarkable art installations on the playa this year. Both figures were made from a really solid internal framework that most resembles the support structure for a water tower. On top of this, the artist layered loads of this very thin wood planking that almost resembles birch bark. It is the material that is compressed and glued to together to make plywood. 

The forced perspective in this image does not due justice to the size of this. The male figure was a good 3-4 stories tall, and both figures were entirely hollow. You could climb up/down the internal structure via helical staircases with the eyes being the highest reachable point. 

The holes in the armpits and in the female figure's back were created prior to the burn to improve airflow at the recommendation of the several fire safety experts on hand to supervise the burn. It was quite an experience to watch something so massive and beautiful just go up in flames. This image was captured at a particularly still moment. In reality, there were fairly strong winds gusting for the burn and the flames whipped off the back of the male figure's head like fluid more than fire. The winds in combination with the statues' positions and the heat of the blaze caused the burn to spit out fairly massive dust eddies while it incinerated. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention, at night, the plastic/mechanical heart inside each figure glowed in brilliant colors while a motor gave the illusion of it beating.http://i.imgur.com/J0Leu1r.jpgI believe this picture should be [credited to Trey Ratcliffe](https://plus.google.com/105237212888595777019/posts/5hrWJQ6Th8S).Reminds me of the energy drawn in Alex Grey's Kissing

For those who have never heard of it, it's a book about Douglas Adams going around visiting severely endangered species around the globe, and it's just as amazing a read as you'd think.

It is sad to think about though in some ways as at one point Adams finally manages to see a white rhino and her calf... but both were unquestionably killed by poachers. :(I can't believe the situation is that bad. very sad actually.

In case anyone was wondering like I was, Santorini is an island of Greece.  

I think if I could retire anywhere in the world it would be in the Mediterranean because it seems like along the coast of Italy and Greece it seems so peaceful and mellow.  Nice! You guys have a built in thing for bottle rockets!The world is hugeSantorini is on my bucket list. Beautiful! I would just sit there for hours listening to some psychedelic music and enjoying the view. So relaxing.is this the Petras hotel?Go for a hike on the mountain near perissaOff season island hopping in Greece is the best. Less tourists, more Greeks. 

It's not as crazy and you don't have to worry about getting anywhere before the crowds accumulate. Name of hotel? Just so I know where to go for epic lodgings in Greece[I too was at a hotel in Santorini not too long ago!](http://i.imgur.com/Yr1P6j1.jpg)

After hours of digging I found a page in Japanese detailing a custom cable someone had built and the unlock process involved. Unfortunately I couldn't make sense of one of the diagrams and emailed the author to ask if he could help me build one. He offered to just ship me his cable instead, and said I could hold onto it until he needed it again. He declined to let me cover the shipping cost (from Japan!).

Sure enough it arrived a couple weeks later, I used it and put it in a drawer. He emailed me about nine months later asking for his cable back, and I sent it. Never knew his real name, never spoke to him again.

There are a lot of things about living in Japan that I'm *over*, but this is one piece of Japanese culture I miss a lot: the way people trust each other and the much higher societal standard for ""doing the right thing"" in everyday life. Realized you dropped something in the street? Just go back and it'll be there -- even your wallet, contents undisturbed. Got your bike stolen? Someone was probably just drunk and needed a way home, it'll be back where they took it from or turned into the police within a couple days. Hell, people don't even use *locks* on their bikes.

Even online auctions in Japan just use bank-to-bank transfers, because it's considered so shitty to steal from people. I bought several concert tickets this way. One time the seller was even on the phone with the shipping company at 5am to make sure I got the tickets before leaving Tokyo at noon on the day of delivery.

Japan is just as weird as you've heard, but also filled with a lot of golden-hearted people.Similarly, I ordered a 3ds xl charging cradle from a Japanese e-bayer and included were 4-5 Japanese candies and treats, along with a sweet message.

Those folks are alright.

edited for grammarI ordered a backpack on eBay from China once. Got the backpack and a pair of socks that were children's size. The note said ""We give good luck socks for great year."" Lovely :)Can confirm. Japanese people as a generality are so humble and giving. 
I asked a man where a cord was in the store. And he got so so sad when he didn't know where it was. So  I went to look for it. 
10 mins later he comes running up drenched in sweat with the cord 

From another store. 

I want him to be all of humanity 
Edit: thank you guys so much. Such a high rate of up vote. I love you. I wish people sent me Pokemon cards wanting to be friends.>It is called a ""Pokemon Card"" very popular in Japan

This reminds me of my Japanese friend asking me if we had 7-11s in the United States. I said ""Yeah, but they don't sell sushi,"" and she was surprised that Americans even *eat* sushi.

Other popular questions while I was there: ""Do you know Brad Pitt?"" and ""Have you ever been shot at?"" (Both of those make a certain amount of sense, when you consider that almost all of the average Japanese person's knowledge of the US comes from American movies.)That's kinda cool, my son got some Bay Blades (sp?) from ebay that came straight from Japan, and the seller put a Japanese Kit-Kat bar in each one. It was cool for my son because obviously it was something from another country, and in Japan they have dozens of different flavors for things like Kit-Kat.Wow! That's super nice! You should totally be this guy's friend. This sounds dorky, but it's always heartwarming to see little slices of humanity like this.So..is it...in you?I kind of want to buy something from Japan now.What did you really order I wonder?eBay, the new social network.As someone who does not play (or know anything about) Pokemon .. is that good..?Please tell me you added him.I ordered a jacket from a japanese guy on eBay, and with the jacket he sent me [this nice little gift](http://i.imgur.com/orgPtfk.jpg).> It is called ""POKEMON CARD"" 

For some reason that made me crack up.I want to see Canadians and Japanese have a ""polite-off"" where they try to be nicer than each other.
So... Do you have a Facebook? I have a Facebook.Going to start ordering stuff from japan. Even if i don't want/need any of it.I've ordered Godzilla figures from Japan and the sellers are always super nice, they usually pack some Japanese snacks with the item as well.That face at the end though.I order stuff from Japan quite frequently.  This is definitely the norm.  It's common to receive a letter of thanks asking to be friends or what not.  They usually like to also include a small gift, usually something representing Japan.  Usually I get postcards from their region, tea, etc.BRB. Going to order something from JapanThis is great! You should send him something in return.

1 - Steal and disable Droids without testing or formatting.

2 - Drive across the entire planet on a route that includes tiny piss-ant farming settlements that could only want a droid every 10 years or so.

3 - Sell droids with classic inept bargaining skills.

4 - Provide no audit or sales records when asked by Imperial Police Forces until near death and home destroyed (see point 3, ""bargaining"" skills).

5 - ???

6 - ProfitThat is so freaking cool!  How did you make the eyes?next year you can reuse them as black mage costumesNot entirely related: I was at a con in Germany in the nineties for pen&paper rpg, tabletops, strategy games and such stuff. It was just about the time, when people started to go in costumes to such events. It was in a gym, there were tables where you could join a game. Three of the huge windows didn't have shades (broken maybe), so they hung up some black cloth for the atomsphere and on the last day, they were torn down.

Also on day 3 there was a contest for the best costume. There was a girl in a dark elf costume and she put clearly a lot of love and work in it. A guy with whom I was playing Shadowrun for 2 days took some of the black cloth and wrapped it around himself and stormed onto the stage in the last moment as Emperor Palpatine. The vote was cast by the cheering of the audience and that guy won. The dark elf came in second and was totally crushed. When the mc asked the winner for some words he turned around to the girl and said in a perfect Emperor voice: ""I can feel your anger"".

He then apologized, said he didn't thought it would turn out that way and gave her the first prize. (IIRC it was a mail order voucher).

Using a 380-foot-long tunnel originally dug towards the center of the pyramid by archaeologists in the 1930s, researchers added an additional three short tunnels and dropped 59 exploratory shafts with the aim of reaching the foundational layer. The old tunnel turned out to stop just 20 feet west of the center, so the new extensions led archaeologists to the pre-construction base of the pyramid where they found the remains of three structures that pre-date the pyramid and the ceremonial offerings they were hoping to find.
The offerings found at the base of the pyramid in the Teotihuacan ruin site just north of Mexico City include a green serpentine stone mask so delicately carved and detailed that archaeologists believe it may have been a portrait.

The find also includes 11 ceremonial clay pots dedicated to a rain god similar to Tlaloc, who was still worshipped in the area 1,500 years later, according to a statement by the National Institute of Anthropology and History, or INAH.

**I've copied and pasted some of the article below but there is a lot more if you want to read click here**

http://cnsnews.com/news/article/feds-airlines-must-let-passengers-fly-pigs-emotional-support


>Pot-bellied pigs must be granted passage on airplanes if they are used for emotional support by their owners, states the Department of Transportations (DOT) draft manual on equity for the disabled in air travel.

>The DOT published its Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel: Draft Technical Assistance Manual in the Federal Register on July 5, providing guidance that allows swine on airplanes if they are determined to be service animals.

>The manual is designed to ""help carriers and indirect carriers and their employees/contractors that provide services or facilities to passengers with disabilities, assist those passengers in accordance with"" the Air Carrier Access Act. The manual open for public comments until Oct. 3.

>The manual states: A passenger arrives at the gate accompanied by a pot-bellied pig. She claims that the pot-bellied pig is her service animal. What should you do?

>Generally, you must permit a passenger with a disability to be accompanied by a service animal, reads the manual.  However, if you have a reasonable basis for questioning whether the animal is a service animal, you may ask for some verification.

>The manual instructs airline carriers and their employees to begin by asking questions about the animal, such as, What tasks or functions does your animal perform for you? or What has its training been?

>If you are not satisfied with the credibility of the answers to these questions or if the service animal is an emotional support or psychiatric service animal, you may request further verification, the guidebook states.  You should also call a CRO [Complaints Resolution Official] if there is any further doubt as to whether the pot-bellied pig is the passenger's service animal.

>**If the answers are satisfactory, pot-bellied pigs, which can weigh as much as 300 pounds, must be accepted aboard the plane.**

>Finally, if you determine that the pot-bellied pig is a service animal, you must permit the service animal to accompany the passenger to her seat provided the animal does not obstruct the aisle or present any safety issues and the animal is behaving appropriately in a public setting, the manual states.

>Last November, ABC News reported that a 300-pound pot-bellied pig flew on a US Airways flight from Philadelphia to Seattle because the animal was deemed a therapeutic companion pet.

>**On a case-by-case basis, the DOT says, animals can be turned away if they are too large or heavy to be accommodated in the aircraft cabin; would pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others; would cause a significant disruption in cabin service; or would be prohibited from entering a foreign country at the aircraft's destination.**

>According to the DOT guidebook, if an animal is not accepted, the carrier must document the decision in writing and provide it to the passenger within 10 days.I've been on a flight where a passenger had to leave because he couldn't control his support parrot.I need a ""fuck you"" salt water crocodile to help me get over my inferiority complex.Looks like today is *not* the day.. when pigs fly.

To be fair, though - I don't know for a fact that the dogs are not ""service dogs"" but when the owner barely has control over the dog and the dog is clearly poorly trained, I really have to wonder.  Not that the dogs were out of hand - although one did try to steal my sandwich off my tray and another I saw cowered in fear the entire time (even when its owner tried to make it look out the window for some crazy reason). Their presumed fakery is annoying for three main reasons: 1) their fake service dogs make real service dogs seem less legit, 2) I always feel sorry for the people on the plane who might be allergic to dogs but end up sitting by them for no real reason and 3) I really, really hope the owner has to pay for the extra seat the dogs took up.","{'Sadness': 0.046621, 'Emotional_Range': 0.795, 'Tentative': 0.424, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.094818, 'Analytical': 0.76, 'Conscientiousness': 0.128, 'Agreeableness': 0.335, 'Joy': 0.037554, 'Disgust': 0.524039, 'Extraversion': 0.563, 'Openness': 0.425, 'Anger': 1.0}",{'sport': 0.331812}

FTFYAll it needs now is Chris Pontius in a devil costume being launched from it.When I was little, my dad would tell me the steam coming out of the sewers was hell.Ghost busters will have this shit under control in no time. Yeah.  City folk.

I moved to Chicago from Austin in the early 80s.  At that time, I think Austin had maybe 300,000 people.

Got my first job in Chicago, had to ride the el train to work.

One day, I'm sitting on the train and it stops.  We are high above the street and I look out and see that the train is on fire.  Yes.  ON. FIRE.

Now not being someone who wants to look stupid, I turn to the businessman reading his paper who is sitting next to me and I quietly say ""Excuse me, the train is on fire"".

He looks past me out the window, says ""Yep"" and goes back to reading his paper.  A minute later one of the train guys comes by my window with a fire extinguisher, puts out the fire and off we go.When we visited New York in 92, there was a subway fire.  My dad always told the story of people pushing the firefighters out of the way on the stairs to get to their trains. [After this fucker terrorized the city 30 years ago..

NYC was worse in the 70s when I was a kid and I had even then mastered ignoring crazy people, stepping over the homeless, staring at the ads above peoples heads when riding the subway to avoid the possibility of accidentally locking eyes with anyone: i.e. a potential crazyThis is exactly the reason why every super hero movie is bullshit.

Remember in Hellboy how they didn't want to expose Hellboy but they had sightings. In reality they would be like ""that's a guy in a costume, dumbass""

Or demons of hell running through New York in Ghostbusters. People would be calling zoo that they have a bear missing and continue their day as usual.

Edit. I do love super hero movies. It's just the people's reactions that are a bit unbelievableEver since that shit went down with Gozer, the Staypuft Marshmellow Man, and Vigo the Destroyer, it takes a lot to get the people of NYC worked up.Uhhh...

I'd find a way to secure and protect it.The little mechanism on the bottom is totally cool, self breaking, but how the hell does it fall unto that little hammer ?It's Plasmid.

Ok, so they aren't filled with a liquid that decomposes into a horribly toxic gas and a carcinogen and they aren't pretty glass balls, but they are still pretty neat. It's called the FIT-5 and it works like a hand grenade but looks more like a landmine. It disperses potassium carbonate which retards combustion as well as reduces overall heat in the area very quickly. When they were first purchased my town used them to put down a working fire at a home with a fully involved second floor in minutes and it saved the bottom floor to the point where they did not have to rip the whole house down.

It looks like HP potion. Everyone here is close, but it was used to mount over oil rag bins as at the time, they were a huge cause of warehouse and factory fires.

Sprinkler systems were crude, but existed when this device was around.

Miracle it hasn't broken yet. How do you know it's not broke? Did you check its bank account or something? Notice the mouse trap like spring?  Seems that the metal lug blocking it would melt (softer metal like lead of something). That would free the spring and smash the glass i'd guess.This is what Wikipedia has to say about them:""Another type of carbon tetrachloride extinguisher was the fire grenade. This consisted of a glass sphere filled with CTC, that was intended to be hurled at the base of a fire (early ones used salt-water, but CTC was more effective). Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were fitted to motor vehicles. Carbon tetrachloride extinguishers were withdrawn in the 1950s because of the chemical's toxicity - exposure to high concentrations damages the nervous system and internal organs. Additionally, when used on a fire, the heat can convert CTC to phosgene gas,[7] formerly used as a chemical weapon.""I'd say very carefully take it out and bring it to a local fire department, they should know how to dispose of these.It looks more like something that would start a fire rather than put one outMy grandfather had several old time fire extinguishers in his garage. That looked similar to this only they had a more tear dropped shape with a wax plug on the bottom. When it got hot enough, the wax melted and the fluid rushed out in a spray.

the other night over dinner i asked my father what the official difference between a pond and a lake was...we both agreed that it essentially came down to size (for the record, there is no universally accepted standard distinction between the two) but one of the defining characteristics of a pond was: ""bodies of water shallow enough for rooted water plants to grow throughout"" and ""bodies of water where light penetrates to the bottom of the waterbody"".... just some food for thought.So mesmerizing!  Thanks for taking me away from work for several minutes. Hydrila, terrible stuff, ruins ponds.The Lord of the Rings swamp always gives me chills.
This is exactly like that.This is the kind of lake were monsters or an ancient nature god lives.How was this shot photographed? Did the people on the boat to sit perfectly still for an hour while the ripples from the boat subsided? when you think about it... our atmosphere is just another ocean, made of gas instead of liquid.

Here's [Nebraska.](http://i.imgur.com/bEa4PYC.jpg) it's because of the irrigation. It's a pivoting sprinkler that rotates. 

Edit: my top comment and it's about irrigation. Thanks guys :) Looks like a cd grave yard.Oh so thats where pie charts are grown. I always wondered where they came from..Center pivot irrigation systems.  I know too much about these.  They are much more efficient than any other irrigation method for several reasons.  The center pivot eliminates the need for machinery and resources (tractor, labor, time) to move a sprinkler row.  Instead, there are electric motors on each wheel which rotate the sprinkler around its pivot.  These move at intervals of about 5 seconds on, 30 seconds off, and move (on the outside of the circle, of which the radius can be up to around a quarter mile) at about 1-2 mph.  Very slow, but they are constantly rotating so there is even coverage over the whole field.  The other major advantage is that the sprinkler heads are hung from the bottom of the main truss section and have a finer, more even mist.  This reduces water waste to evaporation and you also don't have to waste energy throwing it upwards in the air to let it fall down again.  

In short, these are incredibly more efficient because of the automation they are built around.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_pivot_irrigation#mediaviewer/File:Center_Pivot.jpgThe view in [google maps](https://www.google.pt/maps/place/29%C2%B059'34.8%22N+38%C2%B022'01.2%22E/@29.6842759,43.0311782,2159363m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en) is even more incredible.. You can see it from space

Aren't these places shunting down due to the enormous amount of water they used? I read that the Saudi Government was withdrawing the authorizations for this projects..
>Due to the governments awareness of the scarcity of water, the MOA implemented several measures to encourage farmers to apply irrigation water saving techniques. Furthermore, some of the subsidies and support programmes that contributed to the depletion of groundwater resources in agriculture have been discontinued or revised. A collaborative programme has been initiated with the World Bank to provide technical assistance in reorganizing the water sector as a whole.

One of the highlights was our mysterious invitation to the Saudi Arabian embassy. We were given a long presentation about  the future of agriculture in Saudi Arabia, the highlights I recall being their development of desalinating plants and irrigation.

We were encouraged to bring our experience and knowledge as Iowa farm kids to Saudi Arabia, especially if we were interested in vegetable production.

It marks the border between ""normal ground"" and ""sacred ground"". It's also generally a good indicator of how much ground the shrine legally possesses. They are usually a bright red color, and the path would be better kept, but this one seems to have fallen into disrepair. When going through a torii one must walk along the sides, because the center of the path is reserved for the gods. 

The actual shrine where the god lives, where offerings are made, and where people go to pray would be in a building further down the path, but judging by the state of the path it's probably been abandoned and the god has left. fucking fatal frameFirst reaction was ""holy cow those are some nice mods"".

I have never really traveled outside my surrounding states, but went to something in Seattle for a few days for college. We checked in to our hotel, looked out the window, and there was a lot of fog which made the visibility quite poor. Well, after business, we went out that night, partied some, and all woke with hangovers. In a groggy stupor, I got out of bed, opened the curtains, and essentially shit a brick. There before me was a 14,000 foot tall, 500,000 year old stratovolcano that I had never even seen in a photo nor known existed! It was amazingly breathtaking and a complete surprise that that thing was there the previous day and all night and none of us had any idea. I actually had to go on google and find out what the hell it was.

(FYI: it looked a *lot* bigger in person than it does in the originally posted photo -- intimidating and possibly even ominous)

She absolutely loves them. Yes, when I asked her what she wanted to be for Halloween she told me a Xenomorph (we did go back and forth between a queen facehugger or a xeno).

Before this catches on, I think people should be reminded to do their research, don't trust your local nursery or garden center to have native varieties. Some plants look pretty but can be invasive, or otherwise displace native species by increasing wildfire risk in an area where it was previously minimal, for example.

Also, if you want to have maximum impact, do it as a group or plant multiple trees so you can start to create some habitat, which is probably the best outcome for something like this.

Edit: if you want to see how the pros operate, /r/treeplanting/ exists, though as pointed out single tree plantings hardly compare to their operationsYou can think for [DrSuviel](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2dg0iq/my_friend_made_a_baby_groot/cjp98hw) for the idea!Well I'm on board.

Murrow, he did not mention that the lawyers from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis had looked into patenting the Salk Vaccine and concluded that it could not be patented because of prior art  that it would not be considered a patentable invention by standards of the day. Salk implied that the decision was a moral one, but Jane Smith, in her history of the Salk Vaccine, Patenting the Sun, notes that whether or not Salk himself believed what he said to Murrow, the idea of patenting the vaccine had been directly analyzed and the decision was made not to apply for a patent mainly because it would not result in one.

It was amazing. There were two canopy observation options. One option was essentially a giant treehouse, there was a wooden staircase wrapping around a tree which lead to an observation platform at the top of the tree. This one gave a great view of the rainforest from within the canopy. The other observation area was similar to the one in OP's picture. There were three tall metal towers with rope bridges between them. This gave an above the canopy view, which was beautiful around sunset to see the steam coming of the forest.

Yeah, because children used to be super into fucking Monet, amirite?weekly reddit art hate threadCan we make a point of how great a title this is? No sob story, no joke, no opinion, no superfluous comment. Just a plain title detailing what is depicted in the photo. I wish all /r/pics titles were like this. I used to not be into art at all, didn't like or dislike it, frankly I just didn't care. Then I switched majors to film which at my school is only offered as a Visual Art so I was kind of forced to learn about and embrace art.

There are so many people who only see paintings in jpg form which is a shame because real paintings are so big and impressive in person and look so much more complicated than a shitty pixelated version that can't even rendition the colors correctly.

I understand that there is a high cost to understanding and appreciating art, especially modern art, and I think that sucks. I really wish there wasn't this cultural divide about who can and can't take in art, I believe that art should be for everyone!

Like all things, art comes with context and its own subculture. Painters, sculptors and other artists are often making works that comment on a broader discussion of the state of art itself.

For example, part of the radicalism of Jackson Pollock and the NY scene of the 50's, at least to my understanding of it, wasn't **just** because he did some weird abstract thing of dripping paint everywhere. It was also because he was carrying on a legacy that was decades in the making of eschewing the idea of painting as something purely representative. Painting had been moving more towards a form that was purely emotive but people like Pollock and Rothko really capped that off and so in their work you have new and innovative techniques, but techniques that are somewhat commentaries on art itself.

I think that that meta-ness of painting is seriously rad and when I learned that it gave me a new and deeper appreciation for their works.

Art doesn't have to be for you and you certainly don't have to like it. You're allowed to feel and think as you please, but as an artist I humbly request that you might seek to understand the context of things before you judge them, it can really help deepen your understanding and art is just really cool.Huh so its true. Museums do have human sized vents that I could easily crawl through and steal the declaration of independence.I didn't get the impression that this post was anti-anything, but trying to say something that doesn't start a fight is a challenge in this place.I took my son to see the da Vinci codex at the Seattle Art Museum and he spent the whole time running up and down the stairs.
I really liked modern, abstract art as a kid. Not all of it obviously but some pieces just spoke to me. My taste hasn't changed much.

Here is some [mace info](http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/Collections/collection_profiles/CP_mace-e.htm) for the curious!Top job, that man.  Not often the Sergeant at Arms in a parliament gets to do the one main function the job was invented for.I like that the media is focusing on the people who did positive things, and not the gun man.

Kevin kills terrorists.Out of curiosity, if the Sergeant-at-Arms himself did it, does that mean there's a ton less security in the Parliament than in the US Capitol?

I bet he didn't even say sorry after he did it.That picture is him escorting Bridgette DePape out, right? Not sure where else to put this but here's what I got from the video of the shooting:

it starts out when they have the guy cornered. He's standing on the outside (camera side) of the door but is obscured by a pillar (on the left of the screen). I believe the we can see the sergent-at-arms near the end of the hall around the corner from the gunman (on the right side of the screen). The gunman takes the first shot, you can here the pellets/bullet flying bast the camera, sounds to me like a 12 gauge or .308. At this point the security moving towards the gunman would take cover on either side of the hall. This is when Mr. Vickers comes back around the corner and shoots the gunman 6 times. willing to bet he had a revolver. The gunman would have been looking down the hall so vickers had the jump. All of the shots after that are from the security in the hall. Mr. Vickers then clears the gunman and opens the door to check on the people on the other side/clear the room. 

I think the reason he ended up shooting the guy is because of the location of his office and his location in relation to the gunman and other security. Just my two cents though. And he only has three medals?! What an injustice!Was he wearing that uniform when he shot him?  I think I have a broner.Sgt@Arms Vickers did his job well. He's a bad ass in that outfit too.How I wish he had used his sweet ceremonial mace. Wait. Do we know this was a terrorist or just some wacko??He stood on guard for thee.

Up to the rest of us to make sure we remain strong and free.The fact he doesn't seem proud of the fact he shot a man, terrorist or not, makes him even more of a hero for me.And he's getting a medal for that already?

Start offering coffee for free. They will accept a few mugs, but begin feeling bashful about your charity. In a day or two set up a table with coffee and tea for small donations. Start selling homemade baked goods, and maybe bring a big ol pot of soup out. After 3 days of this, stay up all night drinking coffee and tequila mixed with beet juice, watch some horror films. The next morning, stumble out with their daily treats, set them on the table and wait until a few are taken. Make small talk, and cough gently into your arm a couple times. As you turn to leave, fall to your knees and blow bloody chunks all over the sidewalk. ""Hey, someone has a horrible communicable disease!

Take a 5mm allen wrench and remove the four bottom screws that are holding the plate. Once the plate is removed you should see the riser board with a green and white latch on the top.  Pull the latch towards you, and the riser will come loose.  One the riser is removed, move the jumper from pins 1 and 2 and move it to 2 and 3, then back to 1 and 2.  This will flush the CMOS on the riser and you can put everything back together because your system fault error should be cleared.  

If you have any other questions PM me.    If shutting it off doesn't reset it, make sure you find which way the wind is blowing.So, got down. After finding the manual, the guy on the ground let us down manually. Called the rental company and someone came out shortly after. We expected that there was some switch at wasn't flipped but after messing around with the code reader for 45 minutes he called someone else for help. They suggested looking at some electrical panel and it turns out that part of the control board had melted. Only 108 hours on this lift. Big thanks to the Sunbelt Rental because they brought another lift out an hour later and we finished the job. Thanks for all the advice (well some of the advice).

Rising from the sea

The end is near, endless fear

Prepare for miseryOh this motherfucker.  Appears every year around Christmas.

It appeared just before my trip to Japan in 2011.

I thought, AWESOME GONNA GO SEE GOD DAM GODZILLA XMAS TREE!

Oh I planned.  I found out where it was, how to get there, what else we could do.  But the tree, the tree was the most important part.

Our 14 hour flight (hey we had to make a stop on the way, cheap tickets!) was over.  It was 11am.  We dumped our bags at the hotel.  Time to see my new fern god.

Chugging energy drinks as we battled the on set of jet lag we heaved ourselves across Tokyo to the mall where GodZilla lay.

We ran in, we ran around.

Where the fuck was Godzilla?

The Japanese shoppers saw in puzzlement as a grown ass man and his new wife tore around the mall screaming ""Godzilla? GODZILLA?!""

Then a security guard appeared.  He smiled but his eyes where full of sadness.

""Godzilla tree only in 2008, now 2011.""

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

TL:DR: Godzilla tree hasn't been around since 2008, the internet failed to tell me this when I went to Japan in 2011.

Edit: Crown to grown..i was not a king or prince when I ran around the mall.Edward Scissorhands is such a show off.I swear I looked at this at work and psychically I heard my wife in a very definite tone say ""No!"" in my head.It's Reptar!Nothing quite celebrates the birth of our Lord and the accompanying themes of peace on Earth and good will to all mankind like a giant lizard destroying Tokyo.GOZIRRA!!!!!Oh, no - there goes Sbarro.At what point does it stop being a tree and start being Godzilla?This looks like the sworn enemy of Robot Santa Claus.Does this come in a home sized version? Money is not an issue. If this was in America some woman would sue because it scared their fat child.Ken Watanabe says ""Let it snow.""TIL Japanese people celebrate Kishamatsu (a secular Christmas).Reptar??I hope they got a license for Godzilla's likeness, because the owners of it are quite sue happy.Mother-fucking christmas Tokyo, heres a tree monstersince everything is p.c. nowadays and people get offended by anything and everything, shouldn't you have called this a ""winter tree"" ? Fire the mistletoe!Hopefully this enhances the holiday spirit for kids and doesn't scare the crap out of them! Jesus, that so offensive. Do you think it would be OK to make a christmas tree out of a nuclear bomb ?? Some people have no respect to history whatsoever !Will Work For KarmaOnly the best one ever!!thats a godly treeI'm not surprised.

easiest possible.I'm not sure why, but I think I hate this.[deleted]Volume waste? All I see in this family's future is a jar of severed fingers.Get that shit out of here and give me back my lazy Susan.Put in a door with an extra hinge in the middle and then put in a carousel.That's a waste of a corner. That's usually where you put a corner cabinet and stick shit in it you won't see for 10 years.  here comes [German engineering](http://youtu.be/YjVMkBaZ7G4)

..though it doesn't move that smoothly once it's loaded with heavy stuff.. but it's still neatAll I can think about is the fact that you lose half of the available storage space.Wastes space. A corner closet with shelves that slide out are much more space effective and you still get continuos space to store larger objects. Like [these]( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/mJBIcQM3dt4q0VJklDHumKkfXghfVOXh8jvse03BbTkq8rAGDQWnFUQzYUhSezOsP-L8BfI_1xhOlvZZlJPek6rqx1EVpxcwdxxHQYL9wF7QsR9npTJCGdAIz6HAlQaEbqwcgJx3rxSLkbIToHfEBUvEkKlcPak=w384-h256-nc ). And they slide all the way out so you can reach whats furthest back.Did [this](http://allocinit.com/diy-projects/corner-cabinet-drawers-retrofit/) in my kitchen a few years ago.When i saw the thumbnail i thought it was going to be a ""You had one job"" kind of thing. But dam thats cool.I always like having corner spaces like that with shelves (not drawers) with folding door closing it all in. It's great for large items that are not used often but you want space for.

**Edit** 

Quick method from my sis:

*Built a clay mould, using wood glue from the pound shop I layers scrim over the top and let it dry to keep the shape,added some stitching and paint and sewed it with extra scrim to a lycra balaclava and painted it up, I would have done a front face one but the person needs to be able to serve customers during the day, quite a few things I'd change but it was a first attempt at anything like this*

One especially hot spot is a sandbar a little less than a mile off of a popular resort (which used to be called Holiday Isle). Throughout the year locals will anchor their boats on this sandbar and drink away the day on what is known as ""Sandbar Sunday"". 

However during memorial day weekend it becomes an absolute shitshow; hundreds of boats, and thousands of drunks show up crowding the sandbar; there are floating kegs, trampolines, restaurant boats, marintime DJ's, you name it. Every year my buddies and I would spend at least one day refraining from the festivities in order to comb the sandbar the following morning around the asscrack of dawn with masks and snorkels.

Not a year went by where we couldn't pool together 6 or 700 bucks off of jewelry or high end sunglasses sold online, funds which we would use to throw our own party, with blackjack and hookers. You killed 8 people with that knife just for their sunglasses while they were scuba diving with you?Thats a decent haul. I used to work at a ski resort in Tahoe and the lift maintenance folks would get to walk the lift lines after the thaw and find all kinds of stuff. Jewelry, watches, glasses and lots of paraphernalia.

Story time: I was working the main mid-lift one very stormy day and had to take a crap pretty badly toward 3:00pm or so, you couldn't tell because it was white out conditions. I called for a relief person but none were available. keep in mind this is the main lift back down the mountain for the employees so it had to always be manned until all clear was called. I held out for as long as i could and then made the choice to take a crap in one of the plastic garbage bags I had. This was tough because a fellow co-worker could enter the lift shack at any moment since visibility was about 6 feet. I unceremoniously squatted in the corner of the lift and pinched the most vile, horrific loaf a fast as I could and wiped with some tissues. The smell, even in the cold was unreal, like Satans worst movement. I tied up the bag and then for some odd reason instead of putting it in the trash can, tossed it out under the lift line. The bag narrowly missed some stragglers on a lift chair and settled into the powder below them. Three months later I heard through a mutual friend the maintenance guys found the bag and actually opened it up to see my previously frozen shit looking for goodies. They were not happy.I've always thought to myself if the oceans dried up the ocean floor would be lined with sunglasses.Just like a snorkeler to bring a knife to a sunglasses fight.If anyone finds a titanium wedding ring just off Cheeca Lodge on the Florida Keys please let me know, I lost it on my honeymoon in 2005 and my wife is still fucking furious.

Thanks$10 for those Ray Bans. I'll pay S&H.That's a good haul for 2 hours what no used condoms and broken dreams? PCB SPRANG BREAK FOR EVAH
I want my knife back.Obviously these people were all eaten by sharks. Youre lucky to be alive.http://imgur.com/Mc8qCisI actually lost a pair of sunglasses in PCB on labor day weekend. I loved that pair and am pretty bummed they weren't pictured here. i live/snorkel PBC all the time and never find any booty. Maybe some golf balls. Where were you? Did you find anyone's dignity cast into the ocean from spring break? Thought you said on PCP...was very confused. My family took a trip to Hawaii last spring and my brother found what we think is an engagement ring while snorkeling on a beach full of people. 'PCB' means 'printed circuit board'. Pretend for a moment not everyone is hip to your acronyms. Nice. Buck is a high quality knife. That's not a dive knife though, which raises questions about the reasons it was in the waterMy name is Buck and I like to... store my knife somewhere safe so I don't drop it into the ^****bloop**** ... aw shit.Even a pair of ray bans, lucky.Sweet Wayfarers.  Time to take some old records off the shelf...Huh...that's where those sunglasses went...

At least I brought an extra pair when I went on vacation...

(In all seriousness, they're probably not mine, but I did lose a pair of shades on my vacation to Florida.)Went to PCB this summer.

I had a professor who did a project instead of a thesis for his PhD. He got true vellum. Made his own quill. Used the most authentic ink he could find online. He then spent weeks replicating one page from an ancient codex of the gospels. 

He said it took 20+ hours to replicate the one page because the calligraphy had to be correct and the spelling had to be exact. You had to not touch the vellum and basically had to hover your writing hand as you wrote. The vellum had to be at a specific angle and it murdered your back to do it. 

It really puts the value of text in perspective, especially when you realize that men dedicated their lives as monks to preserve and copy the writings of western civilization.

Edit: also, sorry for my awful grammar in the headline. Don't know what I was thinking.Does anyone know what the coloured markings in the text are?

Edit: Thanks guys! That makes a lot of sense. I didn't even really consider the value of parchment back then.These is an exceptional example, both in its quality and its frequency. More commonly, the holes were left in the parchment and the scribe worked around them, like [this](http://library.osu.edu/blogs/rarebooks/files/2008/12/gui_mss-hole.jpg). In OP's particular case, it wasn't even a repair, but an addition. Parchment, since it's made from skin, is almost never square and as such has wonky edges. The leaf in the image didn't quite have enough material to make a full one, so the scribe got a scrap piece and cut it to fit whatever size he needed. This could occur at the original point of creation or later on when the text was rebound. Repairs certainly happened, but they usually occurred somewhere more central in the leaf, like [this](https://medievalbooks.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/leiden_ub_bpl_25.jpg) or [this](https://medievalbooks.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/uppsala_universtity_library1.jpg) or [this](http://library.osu.edu/blogs/rarebooks/files/2008/12/pagula_sewing3.jpg), or even using glue, like [this](http://www.lanecc.edu/sites/default/files/archives/m006_patch3.jpg) (you can see stitching, too).

[Here](http://web.ceu.hu/medstud/manual/MMM/bookbinding.html) is a pretty good website about medieval book production, but the authoritative book is Tim Graham's *Introduction to Manuscript Studies* (Cornell, 2007)

Hope the helps a little. Happy reading!

**Edit**: fixed linksI think it's important to remember that these books weren't made from ""paper"", but parchment (the skins of an animal). With proper preservation and preparation of the skin it can last ages (in the right environment of course). Repairs are easier to perform on a skin in an already made book versus cellulose paper. The cost and time consuming nature of parchment made ""on the fly"" repairs like this almost mandatory.

Today modern binders perform miracles on damaged books and manuscripts. Sadly it's a skill you don't often hear about in your normal daily routine (much like horology). There's only a few ""big names or businesses"" left performing this art, and if you're feeling inquisitive do a search for it. There's a large binding house in England that had some youtube videos about some of their processes. They are really good if this subject interests you.

If I can find the link to their site I'll post it here. (Sorry on mobile so make take a moment).

http://www.georgebayntun.com

Is one. Check out their tooling section. They also run a used book store as well.That's awesome. What's crazy is how much time they had for stuff like this. 

""Yeah, I spent most my day sewing this piece of paper together.""

I wish we all took that much pride in our crafts. I'm assuming paper was scarce based on the extent they went through to repair a single piece, so why would they leave such large margins on the page? Wouldn't that just increase the pages they would need per document?They did a good job if it held for 700 years. Its like Kintsugi! This is beautiful! Feel free to check out /r/medievalart as well! Relevant: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi

""As a philosophy it speaks to breakage and repair becoming part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise""I think this might actually be vellum. Paper was almost impossible to come by at that time. Medieval art historian here. Hmm. A couple of things aren't right with this. First, this is a cut, not a tear (you can't really tear parchment, and you certainly can't tear it and leave the rest of the page intact, like this). This is the kind of cut that happens during the rebinding process when edges are trimmed or someone has gotten careless with a blade. So the cut likely happened long after the manuscript was written. Also, there is absolutely no reason to have taken the time to stitch this empty margin back onto the book. At this point, manuscripts were big business and a leaf with this kind of damage would not have made it into the book in the first place if it were being made on commission. Also, those colors and their arrangement are not really something you would see in a medieval book (and judging by the hue of the rubrics in the text, the color of this image has been adjusted digitally. Red and blue rubrications were not quite that vibrant).  Also, the amount of punctuation and textual abbreviation in the text itself indicates that this manuscript was made for the clergy, not for a private citizen, therefor this level of pointless decoration for a flaw in the vellum would not have occurred. So, while it's a neat bit of needlework, it almost certainly is not medieval, but a modern repair for a modern bit of damage. Is that latin?What's it say?Does anyone know the font?
wow that must have took a long timeI can't imagine how sharp a needle would have to be to puncture the paper without crinkling it. That's beautiful.I love how they put the time into fixing it, yet there were no words on it that would be lost if it wasn't.Reminds me of Kintsugi, a Japanese art form that involves gluing broken ceramics with gold. 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KintsugiThat looks a lot like an audio WAV form.Very cool - this is sort of like the art of [Kintsugi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi). In that I think the broken page is more interesting and beautiful from the repair.This reminds me of the Japanese concept of [kintsugi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi), where broken pottery is fixed with gold and resin to accent the break rather than hide it.","{'Sadness': 0.272097, 'Emotional_Range': 0.743, 'Tentative': 0.812, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.161684, 'Analytical': 0.308, 'Conscientiousness': 0.158, 'Agreeableness': 0.389, 'Joy': 0.066423, 'Disgust': 0.049395, 'Extraversion': 0.457, 'Openness': 0.537, 'Anger': 0.887835}","{'book': 0.28905, 'webcam': 0.975873}"

You just destroyed your baby's natural fear of demon baby snatchers. My mom did something similar to my dad YEARS ago.

My dad said one night over dinner that he has been having these nightmares about the show and that he was going to be abducted and what nots.  My sister was an alien a few years prior for Halloween and my mother is an asshole.  (I say that with love.  Shes awesome, but she pranks EVERYONE. We all hate it.)

My great great aunt visited Europe from Maine sometime around then and when she returned her health failed.
For about 100 years all of her belongings were stored in my great great grandmothers attic untouched. As we were going through her things a few years ago, this plaster casting caught my eye because the colors were still so vivid and bright after all this time.

Luckily a few people gave them beers to hold while they were pelted with water cannons. I've saved a girls life, she was underwater for about 45 seconds, it was our annual river raft race that looks 100% like this. I untied my rafts and barely grasped her wrist. Not a single person noticed I pulled a near drowned girl from continuing under 100s of rafts, but my group of friends. Needless to say haven't been back since.  

Edit: Wow thanks I've never had gold before!!! I did get a nice little make-out sesh, but luckily I was standing up watching upstream and just happened to see her fall in initially. It was a nice coincidence that I had my Mighty Mouse shirt on that says ""Here I come to save the day"". Can't make this shit up. A survival raft!  Someone's dad is going to be pissed.

Remodel of the store. This included new fish tanks.

All new, looked nice. Lots of cool equipment set up by professionals, not normal employees.


After that the actual fish were put in and taken care of by people with zero training. Literally no additional education in handling live animals. They receive the same attention and care as the motor oil. That is to say, unless it makes a mess, it is ignored.


Not 12 hours after the first fish were put in an entire tank was dead. Must have been over thirty dead fish in just that one tank. Within the week approximately 1/2 of all the fish in all the tanks were dead.Because people are stupid enough to buy fish from walmart. Nobody is answering the question.

**WHY** do they sell fish if they can't care for them properly?

They can - they just don't. Why? Because it's less expensive to replace them than it is to make sure they stay alive.

Profit is the driving force here, and it does not always align with life.If I walked into any pet store and there were pens for dogs, cats, and birds but 75% of them were laying there dead, they'd be shut down within the day.Former Walmart pet department employee here. As there is not much to do whilst working at Walmart, I spent my shifts meticulously facing the tiny cans of cat food and studying the fish. 

Every time I noticed a tank of fish infected with ick (it looks like little white spots all over the fish) I would get out my dry erase marker and write ""sorry, not for sale, we are sick!"" On the tank and leave a message for the department manager that there was a tank requiring treatment. 

Every time I came in for another shift, I'd notice my message had been wiped off and the fish were back up for sale despite still being sick. 

Long story short, because Walmart doesn't give a shit about fish nor do they train their employees on how to properly care for them. I just bought two betta from petsmart and this is what they were housed in also. The workers will tell you that 'it's okay they can survive in those conditions'. And it's such crap. Just because something can survive doesn't mean that it's what it thrives in. I did a ton of research after I bought them and this is literally the worst living condition for these beautiful fish, It makes me sick. They literally die of boredom, they become complacent and simply rot away. So sadWalmart is currently in a state of retraction in terms of its sales force: Hours for most floor associates have been cut over the last few years and department managers are having less staff to do the same work that was done by a larger team in years past. Only Walmart hasn't cut back on the things that they expect their teams to get done. 

So you've got a situation where there actually kinda used to be enough people to get everything done, but in the past few years there hasn't been. And Walmart would be loath to cut back on what it was offering. This is especially true as most of senior management comes, these days, from the logistics side of the business. See, Walmart isn't a store chain as much as it is the world's most effective logistical machine at bringing cheap shit from China to every town with more than 5,000 people in it in America. 

Source: I worked for a group that, let's say, ""watched Walmart"" of a number of years, had personal relationships with associate activists, and read every word on the subject for a number of years.""No, he's just stunned.
Pining for the fjords."" 

""Pining for the fjords!?  If you hadn't skewered him in this bowl he'd be pushing up the daisies, glubbing along with the choir invisible This is an ex-fish""Don't shop at Walmart. Plain and simple. Wal-Mart doesn't even give a shit about its human employees. Why would they be super concerned about these fish?Stupid Waltons.  Zero character.  They don't care about their business.  They run a slash and burn operation.

What do they like to say.... walmart brings low prices?  Guess what.  Give people a chance to vote and people will kick your shitty store right out of town if ""low prices"" comes because of stupid shit like this (poor upkeep).

There were plenty of stores that existed before that shit stain Walmart came about.  And they functioned just fine.  And the prices were fine.  And they were cool and unique.

And how is this not animal cruelty?  A lady goes to jail for having pets a filthy house, but Walmart just runs a torture house and no big deal?

Oh that's right, more convoluted illogical bullshit laws.

There is absolutely no reason for the Waltons to be in control of so much money.  I don't want some asshole who can't even run a pet department correctly to be in command of a billion dollars.

The Waltons need a war brought down upon them.It's beta, there'll be fewer bugs down the road.Walmart, and most pet stores should NOT carry fish, I totally agree.

My best friend works at an aquarium, and I never thought about this issue until she brought it up.  

Fish are still living beings.  They can still be abused.  All I see now is poor treatment, and neglect.Once they die they just swap out the sign from ""Fish!"" to ""Bait!""As someone who worked for Walmart, specifically in the pet department, lemme clue you in on the inner workings of the Big Box Retailer. 

They never, ever staff to metrics. It's always under. And I'm not talking a few hours a week. I'm talking hundreds. This is the main controllable that managers get bonuses off of. So, when there is one person per shift in a department, that's why things don't get taken care of as well as they should. 

Now, couple that with the registers being the priority staffing point, and associates from other departments being called up front to ring, you have two ingredients for a recipe for disaster. Pets, housewares, etc. are usually the first ones called up because they are usually frequented by shoppers who know exactly what they want and can actually read well enough to find it on the shelves themselves. So for a 6 hour shift, you're spending maybe 1.5 - 2 hours actually in your department. 

During this time, you have to put away returns, pull overstock, push freight, update signage, clean the aisles/shelves, face the product, AND take care of the fish. Something isn't going to get done. 

Now, staff the department with employees who generally don't give a fuck, and now you have the complete recipe. I tried to clean 2 or 3 tanks a day that I was there, including doing the dead fish log and all that wonderful shit. Wasn't going to happen. The amount of shit in the rocks that gets kicked up as soon as they're disturbed is astronomical. 

They're a hassle, and I'm surprised that location still stocks live critters. Most of the ones around here phased them out a long time ago, and haven't looked back since. How is this not considered animal cruelty? OP they wanna know more.  https://twitter.com/Walmart/status/528821512300539904?s=09Just go to their seafood department. They're ALL dead there.I worked at Walmart.  
Fuck Walmart.  They should get sued for a SO MANY THINGS[These are the eyes of a child who just lost his innocence.](http://imgur.com/pZTPdeT)Maybe if they paid their employees less, they'd do a better job. The bigger question is why doesn't the media publicise this? A picture like this is posted nearly once a month involving a Walmart store. MSNBC and CNN will run petty stories about brewing ""Twitter wars"" and when Oreo makes a stupid fucking rainbow cookie. People don't get outraged unless they know and our media unfortunately doesn't care what Walmart is doing unless they made a page for fat girls in need of a Halloween costume. Petty is important. Dead is drawl. [deleted]This same thing happended at the walmart where I live. I have called and complained to managers several times but there always seems to be dead fish. Fuck walmart man.....big buisness BULLSHIT!Younglings, this makes it okay to steal fish from Walmart. Liberate them into your fish bowls/tanks. Stealing these fish before they die is a good thing.

Kinda funny to see a town you visited last week on reddit.There's creepy fog, then there's mesmerizing and magical fog. 

This is the latter.Europe is truly what our fairy tales are made of. God that's beautiful.The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,

The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,

Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,

Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,

Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,

Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,

And seeing that it was a soft October night,

Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

Sigh.Planking is so 2011.Looking at this, and thinking about this from a cats perspective.. could you not imagine a cats body to be incredibly comfortable? 

I don't actually own a cat, and I'm a bit drunk right now so I don't know if this makes sense and a cat owner could probably verify.. but is the cats fur/skin slippery? Like on the inside, around the organs and the skeleton does it move quite a bit if you stroke a bit harder?

What I'm thinking is, is like a cats body is kind of like a human in a sleeping bag. You could practically sleep anywhere and be comfortable. Only a thinner version that gives the same comfort, with some natural evolution style cat skin comfort.. which hasn't been invented yet in a sleeping bag because companies are lazy and who would buy the 'most comfortable sleeping bag' for £300 or whatever that would cost.It's common for cats to chase phantom mice or birds when they are bored. What humans don't know is that cats are actually chasing prey in a parallel universe. Cats can see up to 2 alternate universes, one for each eye lid (they have three but what we see counts as one). Not every cat can see the same universe as the next but they are able to emphatically bring a buddy in for some co-op.Basically what you are seeing here is your cat laying down on a ""phantom"" table that exist in another realm.Obviously you haven't heard of an air mattressWhat the hell is wrong with catsThat cat is showing off. Competitive napping.

JOANNAThere used to be a redditor that would delight listeners with tales about intelligence in crows and other corvids, but the intelligence in monitor lizards is pretty impressive too, often overlooked and only recently being  investigated.

They have a good aptitude for problem solving, someone gave monitors a clear plastic tube filled with food and hinge doors on each side, and the monitors solved the puzzle pretty quickly. They learned and remembered how to do deal with the apparatus and did it quicker each time. Not bad for a lizard...

This particular species has been important in advancing our understanding of dinosaurs too! In a sexy paper in [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7488/full/nature12871.html) showed that *Varanus exanthematicus* uses unidirectional breathing like birds! Unlike our inefficient way of breathing in and out these guys can extract oxygen during [inhalation and exhalation](http://voices.nationalgeographic.com//files/2013/12/2-one-way-breathing-lizard-s2048x1147-p.jpg). 

[Crocodylians](http://news.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_article_l/public/article_images/201011511.jpg) have also been shown to have this type of unidirectional breathing, and since crocs, birds and now varanids all have unidirectional breathing it seems the ancestral state of the clade and the chances are high that dinosaurs used a similar system!

Show up, 6'2"" with a 10' broadsword made of PVC. Dominate. Hear the lamentation of the women (moms).I admit it, you are better than I am.

Then why are you smiling?

Because I know something you don't know.

And what is that?

I... am not left-handed.Damn. I'd like to be on the back porch watching the kids duel with foam swords and arguing about if it really was a deadly strike. Then one kid is destined to get a scratched cornea while the poor bully kid (the remedial one who smells like mashed potatoes and old dog) is gonna bring a half broom handle wrapped in pipe insulation and really hurt someone. I can hear the little snot nose punks now. Classic childhood moments.

EDIT: reminds me of a birthday party my cousin threw for his 10 year old son. We'd done the party games, the pin the tail, the pinata, the musical chairs. Over the hours we'd been sipping from a bottle hid in the kitchen so by the early evening we were pretty toasted. So I came up with the brilliant idea: let's put the kids in the middle of the lawn, stand on the back steps and throw dollar bills (fuck candy, kids love money!) You should've seen the battle royale, the feeding frenzy as we proceeded to rain crumpled up dollar bills into a maddening frenzy of 10 year olds. Oh, those were good times.

This 12 and under crap is limiting the experts out, typical.This takes me back.  Some of the most fun I had in my teen years was making ""swords"" with  my friends out of PVC pipe, foam insulation and duct tape, and beating each other senseless with them.  There was a big group of people who would gather in our neighborhood and fight.  Costumes were not required, but were welcome for those who liked to role play.  We had several ""guilds"" within our group, each of which practiced different skills and used different weapons.  I was in the Samurai Guild, the leader of which was a guy who was very practiced in Kendo, and was able to teach us some.  There was ""magic"", but nobody really used it except for one fat guy who didn't want to move much.  We mostly ignored his spells and just beat the hell out of eachother with our swords and axes.  Good times!I've always wondered by Swordmanship went out. I mean it was such a big part of culture forever then poof not really practiced. I mean there are small cult things or fencing which I don't consider like regular sword fighting. It would be cool to attend like a wooden sword fighting event with head gear.12 and under

It is the only complete example of a Viking helmet yet discovered, and was found beneath a burial mound on a farm in Norway, broken into nine pieces. The helmet was designed with a horizontal rim that went around the head, attached to which were two vertical strips, one extending from ear to ear, the other from the front of the head to the back. Protective iron plates were riveted onto this framework. It probably would have had an aventail (a chainmail neck guard) but none was found.


The discovery was made in 1943 at Gjermundbu, a site that is just outside the village of Haugsbygd in the Ringerike municipality of Norway. In fact, two rich Viking burials were uncovered there, named Gjermundbu and Gjermundbu II. Excavations revealed a huge number of Viking warrior gravegoods. In addition to the helmet, these included spears, axes, swords, shields, and a chainmail shirt, all of which were dated to the second half of the 10th century.


Few remains of Viking Age helmets survive in the archaeological record. Maybe they were considered heirlooms and passed down from father to son, rather than being buried with the dead. The Gjermundbu helmet is similar in design to the pre-Viking helmets that were found in the 6th- to 8th-century AD Swedish Vendel burials. These feature a rounded cap with the spectacled-face guard, and mail aventails, a design that was common across Anglo-Saxon, Frank, and Slav cultures, and often embellished by decorations to depict individual warriors. Such ornamentation disappeared in later periods, in favour of a simpler standardised conical helmet with a nosepiece. There is no evidence that Vikings wore horned or winged helmets into battle. Horned helmets did exist in pre-Viking Nordic and Germanic cultures, but for ceremonial use only. The enduring image of horned-helmeted Vikings probably stemmed from a misinterpretation of evidence, popularised in 19th-century Romanticism, and taken up by the German costume-designer Carl Emil Doepler for the Viking characters in Wagners operatic version of the Nibelungenlied, thus embedding the image in popular culture of the time.

The Gjermundbu Helmet is on display at the Historical Museum, part of the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo, on Frederiksgate 2.

When I lived in Lyon, France they had the [funiculars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funiculars_of_Lyon) which went went up the hill.  I was so happy when I found out about these since I lived up the hill.  The only problem was the funiculars stopped running around midnight.  This made for some tough decisions at the bar around 11:45.yep, it's called a [funicular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funicular) and there's over a [hundred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_funicular_railways) in the world.Is it at Mt. Carmel or is that just the name of the train?It's called the Carmelit and it's in Haifa, Israel.

What's interesting is that the platforms separated by stairs don't line up with the train exactly. It's off skew just a little bit. Only the first and last stations are lined up (there are only like 6).a lot of them do.  usually its more gradual.  but many subways position stations at the top of an incline. it converts kinetic energy (energy of motion)  into potential energy (energy of gravity) to slow the train down.  the potential energy is then converted back into kinetic when the train goes back down the incline toward the next station.  its a very simple, yet effective,  system as normally kinetic energy is bled off as heat by applying friction based brakes.  this wastes the energy and puts extra wear and tear on the train and tracks.

Theres like 500 brush strokes'. Anyways, its a single frame picture photoshoped i.e digitally painted on. The ""artist""/photographer name is Matt Molloy. He uses the photoshops paint brushes in correlation with the clone & smudge tool across the skys of single frame photos to achieve that effect. You can plainly see the brush strokes in the middle top. Any person with a wacom tablet could tell you that. Just look at the BIGGER pic of the link i have below. ALL of those strokes are photoshop smudge tool drags and clone tool brush strokes. No Doubt, 100%, i've done it practicing brushes.

[BIGGER](http://blog.dashburst.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8534837233_370f36d63d_o.jpg) - note the brush strokes across the top middle. NOTE the repeating pattern of the stroke, thats the brush flow in P.S.

Hi I'm from Midland.

Any time you goto McDonalds/Chick-fil-a, there is a line around the building. 

McD's has a minivan that will pick you up and drop you off from work.

Not sure about the current pay, but last year they had a sign that said pay started at $14.
 
My mother in law works for Wal-Mart as a night stocker for $15.75/hr.

Yeah the pay is great but there is nowhere to live.

Edit: She makes $17 now. Became a cashier. 
It's because they can't find people work out in Midland. My dad works for shell and had to go out there and last time he talked to the waitress at Abuelo's restaurant and she said that she lives in Abeline like 2 hours away. The restaurant pays for her hotel, the gas, and gives her a huge bonus to go out there for like 6 days at a time. They pay her all that because they can't get enough waitresses. The oil and gas boom has revitalized Midland and they  have more jobs than they can fill right now.Can anyone explain why they chose the ""Wednesday through Tuesday"" language?  Not sure if they still do it but a few years ago here any fast food place would give you a $1000 bonus if you stayed 6m. Most would give you another $3000 at 1 year. Labor shortage + side.I'd be willing to bet that they are doing this because the oil and gas companies have taken all the local workers and now businesses like this are desperate to find employees. If you work 20 hours a week... Probably schedules employees on school 19 hours a weekWorth noting that Midland, Texas is the richest, per capita, city in America. High schoolers have time to work 20h / week? that sound a lot if you are studying.It would make more sense to reward the lower grades with more cash. They'd probably have less turnover. There is a burger joint in Texas (primarily) called Whataburger.  A buddy of mine worked there through high school and when he left for college they gave him a couple hundred dollars as well as guaranteed he could work part time during the summer/xmas breaks if he came home.

Good shit, I hope we see more and more of it.I worked at a Burger King during high school. They had a scholarship through whatever company owned the franchise. I got a 5k scholarship towards college for being a good student. To be honest, there wasn't much competition from the other fast food employees.Get all D's and you'll be promoted to manager. I was hired directly out of college from my internship 5 years ago and have never once seen a bonus. 

I should have dropped out and worked here instead apparently.  I live in midland.  They pay more at McDonalds than at my wife's job.  She is a Vet Tech....I think this is great! Being rewarded and having incentives is always a great thing.Why is a C worth a bonus? A C is exactly average on the bell curve. No high expectations there. Sheesh.For those of you that aren't familiar with west and south Texas, we are currently experiencing an ABSURD oil boom. Oil companies are throwing around ridiculous salaries to any guy who can pass a drug test and stand. This has had a positive and negative influence on things. On one hand rent/gas/groceries are going up in these little towns, but on the other hand, my dipshit buddies that (literally) didnt finish high school are driving range rovers and building nice homes. My cousin, who has ZERO formal education, and no job experience just got a raise to around $450,000/year(not a typo). He works insane hours, but he would've otherwise been stuck in a dead-end job. It is very tempting for me to leave my solid career and go cash in for a few years. Headhunters frequently call and before I can even get a conversation going they are already saying they will double my salary. Not sure what McDonalds incentive is here, but you can bet that it is oil-field related(possibly employee retention?). My uncle lives in Midland and it's hard to hire people in low-wage positions as it is an oil town. A restaurant may only open half of it's restaurant as they don't have enough waiters.

[Midland second highest US city in personal income per capita](http://www.mrt.com/top_stories/article_45baf67e-b34c-5a53-98d1-d0ee660471e2.html)

Midland's average income (as reported by the study in the article):

* 2009: $51,947

* 2010: $58,262

* 2011: $65,173 per capitaIts hard to get people to work at McDonald's in an oil town like Midland.Mcdonalds pays $14 an hour here in Midland,TX. Lol. go boom go. :/ good message though. Wednesday through Tuesday  ?isn't the ""wednesday through tuesday"" part redundant? Ingenious.  Establishing good will as the top commenter said but more important it seems like a promising recruitment strategy to attract top tier employees (kids with their heads on straight) these employees do wonders for the success of a business.  

Also, it's a good thing to do.Cash incentives for getting a C? What a great message to send lol. Someone could be an A student, slack horribly, and get a C, but get a cash bonus.","{'Sadness': 0.052378, 'Emotional_Range': 0.607, 'Tentative': 0.432, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.036932, 'Analytical': 0.217, 'Conscientiousness': 0.33, 'Agreeableness': 0.633, 'Joy': 0.516652, 'Disgust': 0.049385, 'Extraversion': 0.414, 'Openness': 0.258, 'Anger': 0.551997}",{}

The poem appears about a third of the way down in the OCR text: http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/60307558/The one place they didn't use an X was for the eyes?Printed with an IBM 1403 printer, if I'm not mistaken. Extremely fascinating device. Made a cameo with Peter Sellers in Strangelove.Despite the misspellings, the poem is very heartfelt.

That thing looks like it's from the early 90s. Funny. I bought a fourth gen iPod touch and the thing slipped off my knee, dropping into soft beauty bark and exploded into a gazillion pieces. I repaired it at 124 dollars. About three months later, I was getting out of a taxi and my hand spazzed as I was sheathing it in my pocket which forced me spiking it into the ice pack on the street; repaired again. 
Hell bent on protecting my investment, I purchased a drop proof case plus screen protector and never carried it on me, only safeguarded it like a being born of a purer bloodline. Sat it next to the microwave at work, someone decided to boil a Pyrex of water to clean it which forced the steam to condensate, soaking my lord.

I like to think we are kings of eulogy.

Didn't repair it for a couple years then splurged about eight months ago, got it repaired and opted to have it engraved again: ""Liberate tutame ex infernis.""

Put the iPod into Disk Mode and connect it to your Mac. You may be able to reformat the hard drive using Disk Utility, then restore it using iTunes.

It was one day before the supposed typhoon.  Was at the summit at 4:30am and it was just a massive fog.  No light came through so no good shots could be had...  Got some great night shots on the tripod but no sun rise.Hey, really nice shot! [I got a similar result on Mt. Meru in Tanzania](http://i.imgur.com/QOMhvx4.jpg). I had clouds though :(When I climbed Fuji many years ago there was an old man right at the top (somehow connected to the Udon shop up there) and when he saw our foreign faces he laughed at us and said:

This little boy is an example to us all.holy shit, death being the catalyst of life. no better way to end one's journey than by allowing others to continue theirs. My sister passed away recently.  She was an organ donor, and everyone involved in that process was incredibly respectful, compassionate, and above all grateful for her decision.  She saved the lives of several people directly, provided organs for research, and tissues which could wind up helping 100s of people.  As bad as it all was, it's some small comfort knowing that her death wound up helping others.[More information about this great human being in case anyone is interested.] (http://www.chinasmack.com/2014/stories/11-year-old-chinese-boy-donates-organs-to-save-others.html)I always thought you couldn't donate if you had cancer?Relevant XKCD :

http://xkcd.com/659/To see these people bowing to a boy donating his organs, is such a powerful image. I got chills all over my body. the respect they have is so immense.Much respect to this young guy.I find it amazing how something as simple as a few people arching their backs in your direction can mean more than a thousand words of thanks.  
It's like a primitive way of showing appreciation from before we were able to communicate with words.  
It's also great seeing such a positive piece about China. Seems to be in an almost permanent state of negativity these days.  
Respect.I'm not sure if this is relevant, but here goes: 

My close friend took his life three months after he turned 22. Everyone was devastated and so caught off guard. He was so loved. Anyway, during his funeral I was so upset that I didn't think there was anything that could be said that could take away my grief. Well, I was wrong. He was an organ donor. They were able to use pretty much every single organ from the neck down and his eyes. The pastor of the funeral told us that because of his death, his eyes allowed a child to see for the first time. Whoever that kid was is so lucky, his eyes were the most beautiful shade of blue. Miss you, buddy.

 There's nothing that can take the pain away, but I hope for this child's family, the knowledge that he has given others a new chance will help. This will probably get buried but when I was in high school I had a friend who suffered brain damage after being hit by a car while he was crossing the street. He lived for the following three days before his death. He, too, was an organ donor, and the day after his death a story was reported of an anonymous 18 year old boy who had donated his liver to save a young girl. We all knew it was his. Following his death he donated any organ possible, from his heart to his kidneys to his corneas. He was a healthy young man whose death made an immediate and powerful impact on other people's lives. It's a sad but bittersweet story that I'll never forget. Most of the school followed through and became organ donors soon thereafter. RIP Robb. fuck...its too early to feelHere's the whole story in Chinese with more photos, if you guys are interested in, I will try to give a brief translation

http://shaosanbai.blogchina.com/2196016.html

Edit: Very rough one, please forgive any typos and grammar mistakes

The boys name is **Yaoyi Liang**. He came to Shenzhen (close to Guangzhou) 2 years ago with his older brother and sister, who are seeking jobs in this metropolitan.

04/12/2014, his sister noticed Yaoyi was having slight movement disorder, and even fell out one time. Yaoyi was sent to hospital immediately next morning, the examination told that it was brain cancer. The family originally thought modern medical technology could save the little boy, however, after 2 surgeries on 04/16 and 05/08 respectively, things didn't get any better.

Yaoyi had been dreaming to become an astronautic scientist/engineer before he was diagnosed the illness. However he changed his mind, he hoped that if he could recover, he would try his best to be a doctor to help relieving the pain of others. During the period, he showed incredible maturity, never really complains the pain but tried to comfort his mother. 

When it came into June, Yaoyi himself seemed to realize it was coming to the end. He said to his mom: if I cant survive, please donate my body. The family came from rural area in China, his mom who was under-educated, cant really get what her boy was talking about. And then she realized. At the beginning, his sister was strongly against the idea, as per Chinese tradition, it is peaceful only when whole body is buried. After some time, the family understood, that was also another form of living in this world.

06/06, 11:45 AM, Guangzhou Zhongshan 1st Hospital, relatives of Yaoyi were called; 4:35 pm, Yaoyi peacefully passed away. 5:19pm, Yaoyis kidney and liver were collected, and would have transplant to others within 8 hours to save their lives. Yaoyi has become the 142th multi-organ donator in Shenzhen.
I wasn't aware that cancer patients could donate their organs. Are there not concerns about unknown metastasis, circulating tumour cells or circulating free DNA?

Edit: I read further into the thread and this is discussed, never mind! What was his name? This picture is amazing and this child deserves the dignity of his name being known Way to go kid. I'm very proud of youEvery day I come to Reddit for laughs and leave with tears. Reddit is the first ten minutes of Up in constant loop. My grandma received a heart from a young man who died when dove off a pier.  This was in the 90s and they told her she only had about 5 years to live with it and everyone else who did the program.  Thankfully she was given another 18 years.  This was enough to see me be born and grow up. Although she unfortunately passed away a year before I graduated high school, I am so glad I got to know her.  Without someone donating their organs that would have never happened.  Every year my grandma would have a second birthday on the young man that gave her the heart's birthday.  She would go to his grave and release a heart shaped balloon.  Powerful. I wish it was higher resolution so I could frame it and hang it up at my uni accommodation. Pictures like this push me through med school.An 11 year old makes the decision to save as many lives as he can, in the face of impending death. I can't get most full grown adults I know to make a reasonable decision if their life depended on it. This young... child, hero, saint... whatever you call him, had little knowledge and experience of many of the truly wonderful joys and experiences of life, yet was wise enough, and kind enough to ensure others to get a chance he never will. Its much too bad that with type of selflessness and concern for fellow man this child held, that he didn't get many more years to make the world a better place.

The New York City Fire Department responded to a call about the fire and quickly extinguished it. When the fire was under control, one of the firefighters on the scene, David Giannelli, noticed Scarlett carrying her kittens away from the garage one by one. Scarlett herself had been severely burned in the process of pulling her kittens from the fire. Her eyes were blistered shut, her ears and paws burned, and her coat highly singed. The majority of her facial hair had been burnt away. After saving the kittens she was seen to touch each of her kittens with her nose to ensure they were all there and alive, as the blisters on her eyes kept her from being able to see them, and then she collapsed unconscious.This makes my heart explode. What a good mama[The story is incredible](http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/famous/scarlett.html) - four of the five kittens went on to be rehomed and one sadly died. She lived to 2008 which is a good age even for a cat who's lived a peaceful life and when reuters heard about her passing away they put her picture on their huge screen in Times Square for 24 hours!

Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and shall we say, love. 

The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye, and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot has appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch.

Ugly would have been a dark gray tabby striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" 

All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave.

Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running meowing frantically and bump his head against their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him up he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.

One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbors huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. 

Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. I must be hurting him terribly I thought. 

Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear-Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion.

At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. 

Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 

He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for.

Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly.

When I was in sixth grade I was suspended for getting into an argument with my religion teacher. She told us animals have no feelings and don't go to heaven. So, I told her about how my cats were so sweet and a somewhat famous news story of the time (2006) about a dog that saved its owner from something, I don't remember. Anyway, even after all that, her answer was,""Well, no."" I told her,""This is why so many people don't like religion, because of nuts like you!"" I was suspended for a day.

There was this young guy, spoke English fairly well, that offered to drive me to siem riep, but I declined. He started following me, which freaked me out as it was getting late, after spending 3+ hours at the border, but I decided to take him up on his offer to drive to siem riep. 

On the ride, he told me about life growing up on the farm, how he borrows his friends car, whenever he's not using it to drive passengers to the border. He learned English from some monks that would visit his farm every now and then. After almost reaching SR, the car breaks down, and he calls some friends who come with another car and a rope. The journey was about 3 hours with the breakdown but he was always in a good mood, definitely made the effort to keep our spirits up, and overall nice guy. Total cost of the ride was 20usd, which is nothing to us, but is a weeks salary for most them.

One house was hit, the intended one.
Israel phoned the house and told them to leave
Three warning ""knocks"" were made
The family left after the third, apparently they knew the drill
No one was hurt
A big family is now homeless
The family claimed they had no idea what they were targetedLooks like a GBU-24. Brought to you by Raytheon. Daaammn....

...I imagine this tall pixie in the giant's castle on top of the beanstalk swinging an overgrown daffodil flower, trying valiantly to bash in the heads of the enemy and prevent them from overtaking Jack. Sadly, the pixie is slain in battle as the giant, 10 times taller than her, steps on her while running towards Jack. Her lifeless body, partially stuck on his sandal, oozes its innards onto the ground. There's hope though, for pixies are asexual, the juices from her body will fertilize the soil and bring about a group of flowers and trees that will eventually end up growing another pixie, which will be picked and boiled, for that is what the giant eats.Pretty cool?

I'm starting to suspect that I never learnt to do it properly when I was a kid.Good on Brandon Bass, swimming is a skill that people of all ages should have.I took a roller skating class with a bunch of children.  The parents thought I was crazy, but I said they really should be skating too so that they can have bonding time with their children (most of them didn't skate so could have used lessons).  Since I started late, the instructor had the children teach me the things they learned to catch me up.  They were great kids and were very cool about helping an adult learn to skate. :-)   Would take classes with children again.Every human being in earth should learn how to swim.

Learning to swim is out of the question.

Yes, this IS irrational.  Yes, there are other people who share these fears.I think swimming is a basic skill everyone should learn. You don't have to be good at it, but just well enough so if you were to fall in water, you'd be able to keep yourself afloat or able to swim a small distance for help.You would not believe the amount of people who joined the Navy that couldn't swim.

[Here is the Supermoon shot](http://i.imgur.com/eHXgKf7.jpg) that I took last year.Finally my username is relevant! Just saying if it's not obvious, the Moon is never that big on the sky, ever. If this picture hasn't been photo shopped, then the photographer was very far away from the temple and took the picture  with a *big ass scope* that can zoom very far. Cool pic though.Ngl, read that as sailor moon at first. Was very confused. Fun fact; on a regular night the moon still looks bigger to us when close to the horizon, because when it's high up in the sky our brains don't have landmarks to reference its size.If I fits, I sits. Great wallpaperOh merciful Poseidon, have pity on this mechanical mariner.I guess Poseidon didn't want to be outdone by Jesus. What a shit hole! It doesn't even have a roof.PSA to everyone saying it's photoshop:

* The angle of this image suggests it was taken from [the other side of the sounio bay](http://www.mykonosblu.com/assets/media/PICTURES/userfiles/images/images/CAPE%20SOUNIO/BEACH.jpg), *northwest* of the temple. The supermoon rose in the *southeast* in greece.

* The pillars are 6 meters tall, and the distance across the bay to the temple is 1.2 km. If taken at this distance, the pillars would take up an angle of about 18 arc minutes. The supermoon was 36 arc minutes across. Tell me, do the pillars seem to be about half the size of the moon? (they do)

* Someone said you'd have to overexpose the moon to get the temple this bright at night. This wasn't taken at night - since a full moon is always opposite the sun in the sky, the sun had just set, probably just minutes earlier. So, it was still light enough outside to properly expose the temple AND the moon. 

TL;DR: If it's fake, someone should have a medal. That's a great shot! I visited Cape Sounion and the Temple of Poseidon a few months ago. That whole location is so ideal since it is far from the city.PLAY YOUR OCARINA!!!Looks like something straight out of the Ocarina of Time.","{'Sadness': 0.135724, 'Emotional_Range': 0.623, 'Tentative': 0.368, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.682482, 'Analytical': 0.003, 'Conscientiousness': 0.383, 'Agreeableness': 0.424, 'Joy': 0.071637, 'Disgust': 0.045824, 'Extraversion': 0.444, 'Openness': 0.395, 'Anger': 0.649564}","{'arch': 0.377541, 'blue sky': 0.975873, 'nature': 0.268941, 'rock': 0.689974, 'desert': 0.425557}"

http://i.imgur.com/9jJ1UiJ.jpgA fellow I worked with at a previous job came up to me one day and said ""you're good with photoshop, right?""  to which I responded, ""i guess, what can i do for you?""  

He emailed me photo of a baby - his baby.  His wife had given birth the day before.  The baby looked a bit off, eyes closed, skin a slightly greyish tone and what looked like a small tear at the side of her mouth. otherwise she looked like any other baby: knit hat and tiny little gloves, I figured she was asleep.

He asked me - ""Can you get rid of some of the crap that's on her face and maybe brighten up her skin a little?  It's the only photo we were able to take.""

I said sure, of course.  So I went home and spent a while tidying up her photo, smoothing out the little bits of stuff that were on her skin until I was happy with what I had done.

I sent the photo off to him asking if it was all right.

he emailed me back and thanked me and thanked me kept thanking me and he says at the end of all this ""She passed away an hour after she was born and this was the only photo we got of her before they took her away"".

I won't lie, it still makes me sad to think about it, but I know that how I feel is a millionth of what he must feel.

You have my deepest condolences, she is a lovely girl.

Soon what was once a buffer became a war front. Colonies which had known millennia of peace were unprepared for the realities of war. The nemesis crushed the outer races one by one until only their creators, the Precursors, remained. When all seemed lost, the  Precursors stored the secrets to their advanced technology within a single device. The device was sent far beyond known space in the hopes of aiding in the defeat of their own creation. Eventually it landed upon a planet with no apparent intelligent life. The primitive beings there found the device, cut it into pieces, and polished them to be sold as trinkets.

I personally recommend [International Anti-Poaching Foundation](http://www.iapf.org/en/)  ;-)This is a really amazing picture. I've never seen one with a horn so big. I didn't even know they got to looking like that. Thank you. what's this type of rhino called?

i've not seen one with that type of horn beforeI like his little bird friends.**Solution**: Flood the market with a fake ""Rhino based male vigor powder"" that actually causes impotency or worse. Word gets out, the market crashes?

Repeat with other endangered species, which all seem to center around getting boners.Feel like I'm qualified for this thread, I spent 2 weeks on Mankwe game reserve in South Africa that had about 12 White Rhinos. They are ridiculously passionate about anti-poaching, 60% of the entire reserve's resources go to it. 

Someone mentioned if the rhino was tastier it would be farmed intensively (like the buffalo) and the numbers would recover. A much simpler solution I heard out there would simply be to make the rhino horn legal to trade. This would create a boon in trade for reserve managers who can now make a huge income by harmlessly cutting off the horns. You'd still get poaching but not nearly as much with the demand in China and the Middle East satisfied.

An interesting problem reserve managers have is when a rhino dies naturally. Great, you've protected it and it's lived into old age but now you have $300 000 sitting on the ground and it's very difficult to get rid of it:


**Keep it in you house?**Someone will break into you house, kill you and take it. There are so many poor people living on the edge in Africa, if someone knows you have a horn in your house they won't hesitate.


**Bury it with the rhino?** If rumours spread there's a dead rhino lying around someone will either try to track you to where you buried it and dig it up or force you at gunpoint to tell them.


**Just burn it?** The authorities keep tabs on rhinos in the area. If they find out the horn is gone they'll assume you sold it to poachers and you'll be charged.


**Give it to the authorities?** The reserve owner (Dougal) told a story about this: another reserve owner was flipping his shit, thinking he was going to be robbed any second so he gave the horn to the local police station. The station was mysteriously ""robbed"" a few days later and the horn taken. Authorities can be pretty corrupt.


I never got a straight answer on dealing with rhino horns, I don't think they wanted to tell a bunch of students. I suspect they fudged the law a bit in some way, not selling it to poachers but something else, they wouldn't tell us.

Bit of a ramble but hope you appreciate some background on the poaching situation. Got a few more anecdotes, I saw a poacher while I was there and Dougal once threatened a poacher at gunpoint. A few snake stories: one reserve manager was feet away from a Black Mamba crawling through a bush and another had a spitting cobra slide over his legs at night. Yell if anyone wants me to elaborate.If only they were good to eat, then there'd be millions of them, giant factory farms full of rhinos ready to be turned into tasty rhino burgers. 

Worked for Bison That horn would really fuck up your day Ah, the majestic grey unicorn. 

Edit: counting is really hard. Bicorn. My bad...and guess what, China: his powdered-up horn **still** won't give you a 12"" dick.It is horrible that it doesn't look natural to me with a fully grown hornWarning: when photographing these or other beautiful wild beasts make sure to remove the EXIF data or disable location stamps so that poachers don't get a treasure map! Imgur removes it automatically but other services may not!I was expecting to see Jim Carrey crawl out of its ass.Fuck the people that kill these. One of these days we'll be sat around, telling our grandchildren about majestic giant grey creatures which roamed the savannah, and gigantic bears big enough to climb over icebergs on the north pole, and they'll sit in wonderment and wonder if the stories are true, or just grans old tales she likes to make up. Those birds are going to have a strange empty feeling they won't be able to explain once the rhinos are gone... kind of like my life...Assholes in China driving demand for Rhino horns.

Who would kill this beautiful creature? Honestly I've never seen an animal as fascinating as the rhino, from the armor like plates to the ivory horn. Amazing creature, I'm glad I was able to live in a time before they are all wiped away. Save the RhydonOnce those birds developed a taste for rhino meat, it was all but inevitable.Biceratops?Why are we killing these things when we could be riding them into battle?!Very interesting read from Wikipedia:

> In 2011 the Rhino Rescue Project, organized by Ed and Lorinda Hern of the Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve in Krugersdorp South Africa, began a horn-trade control method consisting of infusing the horns (while on the animal) with a mixture of a pink dye and an acaricide (to kill ticks) which is safe for rhinos but toxic to humans. After sedating the animal, holes are drilled into the horns, fittings added, and the cavity connected with rubber hoses to a 2 foot by 4 inch diameter metal container of the liquid mixture which is then pressurized. The infusion takes less than 20 minutes of the 45 minutes of anesthesia; because of the effect of the mass of the animals on their internal organs, they are rolled every 7 minutes while sedated. The procedure also includes inserting three RFID identification chips and taking DNA samples.

>Because of the fibrous nature of rhino horn, the pressurized dye infuses the interior of the horn but does not color the surface or affect rhino behavior. The acaricide is expected to cause nausea, stomach-ache and diarrhea, or convulsions for anyone consuming the horn in Traditional Chinese Medicine, depending on the quantity, but would not be fatal; the primary deterrent being the knowledge that the treatment has been applied, communicated by signs posted at the refuges. The original idea grew out of research looking into using the horn as a reservoir for one-time tick treatments, and the acaricide is selected to be safe for the rhino, oxpeckers, vultures, and other animals in the preserve's ecosystem. It was reported that only one out of 150 rhinos treated did not survive the anesthesia.

>It was claimed that the dye can not be successfully removed from horns, and would remain visible on x-ray scanners even when the horn is ground to a fine powder.

Not all of them are.[deleted]Go to the Air and Space Museum in Washington DC and you can see how big one is for yourself. It's quite fascinating.That would be the Global Hawk.  
[More info here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_RQ-4_Global_Hawk)Personally I find the Black Hornet Nano more impressive.

http://imgur.com/q5XJni6I thought it is something like this: http://www.blogcdn.com/www.switched.com/media/2011/03/800px-rq-11raven1.jpgYups, they're [pretty big](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/RQ-4_Global_Hawk.jpg) , [indeed](http://i.imgur.com/7k1hlmy.jpg).They are also extremely loud.  When I was in Afghanistan we called them ""the lawnmowers in the sky"".  The taliban would not come out if they could hear them.The Global Hawk is a little larger than the standard Predator, as it is designed to have intercontinental range. [Here](http://media.rhizome.org/blog/8688/Bush-w/-Drone.jpg) is a picture that gives a better idea of how large the Predator and Reaper drones are. For scale, GWB is 6 ft (1.82M) tall 

Edit: [Here's a wider shot](http://www.nationalpost.com/news/cms/binary/1727876.jpg?size=620x465)This Global Hawk is probably the biggest UAV (""drone"") out there.  It's got a wingspan bigger than the U-2 (116 ft vs 103 ft).  

This ""drone"" flies around the world, being controlled via satellites from a stateside location.

It's quite different from your average ""drone"".I wish we would stop using the word ""drone"" altogether. It conjures up this terrifying image of **autonomous** aircraft, doing whatever the hell they want, without human intervention. The vast majority of military drones are not this big. That's actually the brood mother. Her offspring are quite smaller.In a shocking plot twist, there actually is a pilot in there and everybody's been calling it a drone all of these years to mess with people's heads.My first two thoughts were how much it reminds me of a penis and how much I wanted to play some smash bros on top of it.My dad got his doctorate in Aerospace-Aeronautical engineering so I remember growing up with posters of f-15s, f-16s, f111 aardvarks and plenty others and used to love all that military stuff. I think it is funny that I hate war and think military budgets are crazy high here in the usa and in the world in general but I still think military shit is badass. that globalhawk is sweet as shit

am I allowed to think the stuff I hate looks sweet and admire the tech involved in it or does that make me a hypocrite?Should be noted that this is not an armed aircraft. The Global Hawk serves pretty much the same purpose as the U-2.They [aren't all that big](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/973040/thumbs/s-HELICOPTER-DRONES-large.jpg?6)THAT is a drone!!! My HOBBY grade quad copter is not!! Recently the RC community has been under fire for flying our RC planes, helicopters, and quads. I do admit that a very, very small percentage of people abuse the technology and have malicious or foolish  intent. However, the overwhelming majority of people involved in the hobby are good people who take the hobby very seriously. They go above and beyond to ensure their model isn't putting anyone or anything in harms way. It's a great, friendly community that's getting a bad rap because of ""drones"" like the one pictured. We fly model aircrafts... not remote missile silos. 

[/rant]everybody seems to think that just because they're remote controlled they're the size of a rc carCan't see the banana... Just how big are they?why put a body in the sky, when human fragility greatly limits the potential of the machines?   Can you imagine the advangtage of a figherjet that doesn't have to worry about it's pilot blacking out in extreme G's? What's up with that big hole on the top?

He had a picture of himself pouring his beer in panel one while his friend caught the stream out of frame below out of frame. Frames 2 and 3 were just the stream of alcohol being poured from above out of frame and the last panel was him again with his mouth open catching the alcohol while his friend poured from above out of frame. 

The end result was perfect. It looked like he was pouring his drink into his own mouth. I wish I had a copy to post, but I don't know the guy.

He was a titan of the used carpet industry. Known throughout the south and east districts of the great used carpet confederacy, as well as most of Mexico. 

Now 21 years later, a widower, blind in one eye, and wall eyed in the remaing orb, he has one last shot at keeping the last store he owns, the one he opened with his dear departed Urigret, while also reconnecting with his five quintuplet daughters on their respective 21st birthdays (one wedding, one out of control, one a miserable unachiever, one disappeared for 4 years [not shown], and then one successful one who blames him for their mother's death).

(Yes. His mother wanted a girl so bad, she named him Harriet. As you can imagine this caused him some minor trouble with school bullies.

Norway, or anywhere there's a car going by with it's headlights on.As a Swede I get more and more compelled to move to Norway.[Cropped at 1920x1080](http://imgur.com/bCT9HjB) for wallpaper.Finally, they finished that highway to Mordor.

Sam and Frodo are going to be pissed. [deleted]I find it hard to believe this is a 10 minute exposure for several reason.

* The clouds are way too sharp for 10 minutes, they should be way more blurred out.
* The lack of noise either means the photographer had exceptional NR or the exposure was simply much shorter; generally a 10 minute exposure is going to produce lots of artifacts and noise at night as the image sensor heats up.
* You really don't need a 10 minute exposure for this shot, it could have easily been done in a few minutes or less.

Edit: EXIF Data shows this image was a **62 second exposure**.

I was so excited... I'd always wanted to try something like it. Charges pretty well (up 5% in 5 min or so, airplane mode) but for some reason, my screen didn't work right while it was plugged in... got really buggy on me. But it felt great to bike a bit after a 7-hr plane ride *and* get a decent charge.It would be funny if it just sprouted wheels and started to carry them to a predetermined destination that had a bunch of wall outlets.Is this the train station Matt Damon goes to in Bourne 1?I feel like if we had these in America, people who are already in good shape would be the only ones using them. I would love these because I don't mind exercising and my battery drains quickly but I'm too cheap to buy a new one.

edit: As many of you have pointed out, these may not be the best option if they require a lot of effort to get some juice for your battery. However, I'd still like to try one to see what it is like. If I could just get on and lightly peddle for about 20 minutes and get a decent charge, I would be all for these.

I know nothing about these and I don't normally go to places that would have them, like an airport, but I don't think they will ever catch on in any country.Gare du Nord?Anybody have good numbers on this? How long would it take to charge the average phone assuming reasonable health?

It's just that last time I got interested in this idea, I ran the numbers out and realized there's no fucking way I'm powering my desktop with a pedal generator, even if I'm a no shit Olympian. Laptops get more doable, since they use much less power. Phones might be a lot more reasonable still.

Edit: a lot of people are asking me why it blooms at night.  In it's native range it's pollinated by the Sphinx Moth which is nocturnal thus requiring a night bloom.  Secondly, the flower itself has little heat tolerance without the protection of it's sepals and thus it wilts as soon as it blooms and then sees it's first sunlight.

I visited Poros two years ago. The walk into town was about a 20 minute walk. Our hotel also provided bikes for either a very small price or free. (My friends and I opted to walk.) I was also surprised by how good the food was at our hotel. It was just as good as many restaurants I've visited.

One thing that I was not expecting was that the beaches I visited didn't have sandy bottoms. If/when I visit again, I'm going to bring water shoes. It wasn't a huge inconvenience, but it's something to consider when planning a visit.Ahh so this is why they like diving so muchWent here last year, extremely nice place with great food and a great beach.

I have never been so bored, never so desperate to look at anything other than soybean fields.This pic is literally Trains, Planes and Automobiles. Did they land in a delta?This is a legit pic. The line number i spotted on the closest fuselage is #5032. In one of the pics of the 3 fuselages on the river bank you can clearly see one of the fuselages is ln #5029. These line numbers are assigned in sequential order and given that 6 fuselages were being transported they had to be on the same shipment.

Edit: Grammar.

""Its well known that the daytime sky is blue because the atmosphere scatters shorter blue wavelengths of light more than longer red wavelengths. Similarly, the team found that the shorter wavelengths of artificial light are scattered most easily on clear nights. But with cloud cover, the long-wavelength red light that is usually sent out into space on clear nights is scattered back down to Earth.

The result is that cloudy nights in urban areas have a reddish glow. And the size of the effect is substantial. Taking measurements hours every night for months in Berlin, the team found that the blue portion of sky glow is 7 times more radiant on cloudy nights than on clear night, while the red portion is 18 times brighter. In the visual range, that translates to cloudy nights being thousands of times brighter than they are in natural dark night conditions.""I live not far from there, and I can tell you that nearly everyone in my neighborhood was outside looking up at the sky.

For some reason it's the lantern that really makes the picture for me.

A cormorant fisherman picture could be almost timeless, staged for tourist photos, etc.

However I've used lanterns like that (his is almost definitely a coleman kerosene lantern, although possibly other brand).. and his is worn with clear years of use. He's taken the old -cormorant fishing- and merged it with newer practical modern tech. For those of us living in cities, such a lantern may seem quaint.. but for people who've lived off grid - it's easy to recognize the sheer utility of them.

So.. it makes the picture more real to me. It's not just an ideal fantasy picture of an anonymous cormorant fisherman. It makes it definitely an actual human being, who has to deal with the day-to-day drudgery of life just like everyone else and had/chose to use something that some might think makes the picture less beautiful.. but I disagree. It makes him all the more powerful. He just chose a certain path, and that path happens to be the picture's topic, which then ties the whole thing together.
Covetous Shen? Is that you?http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1hz2br/an_old_fisherman/These guys are amazing. I watched a documentary on them the other day. They tie a small string around the birds neck so it can't swallow. The fish jump in the water and attempt to swallow the fish. Then they come back to the surface where the fisherman retrieves them from the birds mouth. At the end of the day they give the birds some small fish, otherwise they will refuse to work. So is this like falconry where they have the bird do the fishing?

I'm now considering moving into a van down by the riverAs someone who has lived in a setup nearly exactly the same as this (yes it was a van and I did spend much of my time down by the river), let me give your friend a few pointers.   
1. It gets old. Fast. Do it and be happy until you're not, then don't. If you last longer than 3 months, you've beat me.  
2. You'll get lonely. Moving from place to place with nobody to share your home can be hard on the friend making. Take one or two nights per week and stay at a hostel, or try [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.org/) and be the social butterfly you know you are!  
3. Skip the fast food and eat healthy whenever possible, your body and mind will thank you (as will your flatulence). Fast food stops are your bathrooms. Leave the shit there.   
4. Park your car on side streets of safe neighborhoods. Use logic and watch for street sweeping signs, permits, or crack dens. Walmart allows overnight parking as a last resort. Use a car cover to hide yourself (and block annoying street lights) if needed (but make sure to crack a window).   
5. Sign up to a nationwide gym chain that you'll have access to! Hot tubs. 'Nuff said. But also you don't realize how much you miss hot showers with water pressure until that cloudy day doesn't heat your ""solar shower"" (black plastic bag) trickle of icy pain.  
6. Crack the window at night, get a fan, or get some air flow somehow. Sleeping in a cramped ass car breathing in your own farts is great and all, but the stuffiness and heat can be overwhelming, causing many lacks of sleep.
7. Buy a decent cooler. Keep your ice sealed so it doesn't leak. Leave it open and near your head to keep yourself slightly cooler on hot summer nights.  
8. Glamping is all the rage, don't be left out. Buy a dc/ac converter to go in your cigarette lighter and charge your smart phone and other portable electronics. Just don't exhaust your car's battery or the air.  
9. Propane and propane accessories. These are your friend. Camping stoves are like $25, and small bottles of propane $3 which can last a surprisingly long time. Coleman makes a good propane heated hot water shower, if you find yourself next to a working hose.  
10. Board shorts are great to use when you run out of underwear. Buy some soap and rinse your clothes well, then let air dry on your (clean) car or some twine you hang between trees.   
11. Have fun living the simple life! Remember to go out, meet people, explore the beauty around you, and save a shit ton of money by not paying rent! It's not an easy way to live, but it has it's own rewards :). Good luck!!

Polson sits on Flathead Lake and surrounded by the Mission Range, so absolutely fantastic hiking and water recreation.

Why does sleeping in my own property make me suspicious? I was tired officer so I took a nap. I do not have any other nefarious motives dammit.we need more picsNot sure how hard the details are to reach so, here is a self re-post of them. 
My buddy just graduated from NAU with a major in geology. He picked a spot on the map and decided to try out living in Montana. (We live in California) he wants to in the mean time backpack throughout the wilderness of Montana and find a job there as a rafting guide or something he enjoys doing. Living in his car is a temporary experience he wants to endure during his job search and he hopes to have a place before winter.

The car (Nissan XTerra) is complete with:

    Bed

    Stove

    Solar shower

    Water storage

    Backpacking supplies

    Climbing gear

    Tent

And pretty much all items that he believes (and knows well) that will last him until winter.

As a fellow graduate, and friend since pre school, I am happy that he is doing what he loves doing best. Not many of us can do that.

EDIT: commas and grammar and formatting
Small person advantages.Where does he poop?[deleted]I just pulled the opposite. Keep the apartment, ditch the car. They both were costing me about $400/month, and the apartment is more comfortable to sleep in.Guys, this is not a van, its a 4wd

Me and my father worked together to build something similar in the back of a pretty small four wheel drive. After living in it for a few months i decided to take it out when i got home, i want to build it again with smaller storage. Perhaps 20% storage instead of 40%

Ultimately i saw that i don't need as much storage space and to have more 'breathing' space for sleeping is far more important to me, it felt too cramped. Also the **sex was not too good** when i met a girl and we went travelling a little. We could get away with really cramped missionary, and also side-on road-doggy sex. but nothing much else. Air flow was really stuffy and we needed to open the windows far more than slightly ajar, which made us feel unsafe lol. 

But it's good for when you go on a road trip here and there, but not living. To live in the fourwheel drive it would be preferable to have half that storage space taken away for sleeping, and to put a cover over the bed to store things on top of it, when you sleep just move the stuff onto the roof, or into the front seats. This is what i learnt from building exactly what your friend built. But maybe it will work for them.

Just make sure he knows the + / - ,try a month first before setting off into the sun.  just want to give your friend some realistic advice, no one FROM montana is going to pay him to guide, and its going to be hard for him to get a job guiding in a place vs someone who has grown up / lived here for 20+ years. there are roughly 900k people here and most of them are outdoorsmen, everyone has their own fishing spots on various rivers etc , or knows someone who can take them to do x y z. that being said geology major you can probably find a job working for some form of the oil business in montana. another piece of advice is you can easily die in the summer time in montana from exposure. our last snow was in may. you need good alpine gear if you decide to go out like that , and i would not go out alone . would not keep food in my car depending on where he is at either..Get a gym membership to shower and you're good to go!","{'Sadness': 0.055219, 'Emotional_Range': 0.692, 'Tentative': 0.754, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.047805, 'Analytical': 0.237, 'Conscientiousness': 0.173, 'Agreeableness': 0.772, 'Joy': 0.353671, 'Disgust': 0.057343, 'Extraversion': 0.734, 'Openness': 0.212, 'Anger': 0.720884}",{'car': 0.450166}

Back when I was younger and skinnier and much more active, I was a pretty avid climber.

I was setting a toprope, and due to the awkward shape of the top edge of the cliff, I ended up rappelling over the edge with a grigri to line up the anchors.

Went to climb back up and punched my hand into a wasps' nest like this.

I probably got stung close to 100 times, and ended up picking about 20 stingers just out of my right hand. Had to have my buddy drive me home (an hour drive from the climb site) because I was dizzy and nauseous and feverish. 

But everyone agreed that I looked really hilarious when I was running around on the side of the cliff, suspended by a rope, shrieking as I was being chased by a swarm of wasps. So I had that going for me, which was nice.The mental fortitude it takes to write that, knowing he will have to jump to his death, is remarkable. WASD.

But you are passing up on some pretty sweet hornet honey. Good to recharge you during the climb. The big \\__/  under the wasp nest is often used in climbing to signify the end of a route.  It's a shape you recognize almost instantly when figuring out where you're going to end up.   Clever use of it here.I wrote that a week ago saturday. Climbed there tonight (and last friday?) too. The wasps go to sleep around 7pm or so, but when we got there today (6p) they were pretty godamn active. The start isnt quite a 5.6 if you avoid the wasps. Maybe 5.7 :)

Cant do enough chalk for all the spiders tho. They're just everywhere.

I dont know the diff between a wasp and hornet, sorry. also Hornet is 6 letters long. :) Hard enough to write on the last bits of my chalk on bumpy limestone :)
That guy had some balls to stay and write that, god bless the queenI've almost been bitten twice by bats climbing. They love hiding in the big pockets in the sandstone that are common at the Red River Gorge. 

Also had a big ass spider crawl out onto my hand from inside a crack once. Ended up just taking a whipper rather than let it crawl on me more. I fucking hate spiders 

Now I've got more thing to worry about. That' a hornets nest, not wasps nest.What a brave person to sacrifice their life to save others.

If I order 5 lunches, I get 5 cards punched. After 5 times, that is a weeks worth of free lunches. 

Red Robin is even more awesome. They do it based on how many entrees you buy on one card. Way easier but you have to order 9 entrees before the 10th one is free. That is a great idea. Bring business to the restaurant and receive a small reward, comparatively speaking. My old job ordered huge amounts of food for meetings on a regular basis. When you are picking up shopping bags filled with take out orders, one free lunch is a nice gesture.Well mine will now!FAX.. what is this word?Just add a 20% delivery fee.  All lunches are immediately free.I once had a job where if you ate at your desk you didn't have to take a ""lunch break"", i.e. you were in the office for 8 hours to get your full day in (not 8.5 or 9).  But if you left, then you had to stay 8.5, etc.

Some guys eagerly would go to pick up lunch if you paid for theirs. Penny wise, pound foolish. The smarter ones of us would gladly stay at our desk and pay them. The extra time wasn't worth it. Literally. If lunch cost $10 and you were gone for 30 minutes, that means your time is valued at $20/hr.  We got paid more than $20/hr so it made no sense to go.[deleted]I hate when people don't order in advance, you have to wait in line while two ladies obviously working at the same place order 12 burritos apiece. Fuck call ahead, or send a fax. Quit making people wait half of their lunch break because you are stupid. This is fantastic. Where is this located?Office lunches are always free.Nice.  There used to be (maybe still is) a cafe in Denver that would give you your meal if you played their piano for thirty minutes.

i mean, at that height, your visual range ought to be extended MASSIVELY, so if you were to put a shell-protected camera setup, you should be able to see a much further distance than otherwise. put a camera on a rotating axis and vertical axis, like something used in FPV flight, and add a large zoom, and you should be able to get a good bit of range off of it. plus you could access the camera via computer near your nav/radio area. if you had night vision it could potentially help when scanning for ships after darkhttp://sortieenmer.com/?lang=ennopenopenopenope

That blew my seven year old mind then and seeing stuff like this still blows my mind fourteen years later.

  Edit:

   I remember like it was yesterday. It was the days of believing I could go dig three feet into the dirt in my backyard and find t-rex bones or getting to the moon was a matter of strapping rockets to my back! My dad and I would read nightly from Carl Sagan 1980 novel Cosmos and I would be amazed by the journeys my imagination took me.

   Then one day my dad comes home with a brand new telescope but this was special. It was a very powerful (Powerful to a seven year old.) telescope that hooked up to his computer at the time and you could save images.  For days we went on night gazing sprees of examining space! The moon, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, and distant stars, boy were those the days. We still have that old telescope somewhere but I'm sure they stopped supporting the firmware for it. I'll have to hook it up and see if it works still.

  Anyway thanks OP for helping open up a fond memory from my childhood.

  Edit 2: 

  Thank you for the gold! That was mighty generous. Is Saturn really that big relative to the moon from the perspective of us on earth?I learned what occulted means because of this post. I actually assumed that you meant ""occluded"", and had to google.Wow... I always thought Saturn was a lot bigger than the moon. [http://imgur.com/G1kVZqh](http://imgur.com/G1kVZqh)It always blows my mind how Saturn is almost 750 million miles away, and this is AN ACTUAL PHOTO of it. When your friend's dad took looked through his telescope to look at this, he was looking at Saturn IN PERSON. 

Maybe I'm easily impressed, but that's just unreal to me.Saturn always was my favourite planet I remember the first time I viewed Saturn and Jupiter through my university's telescope, which was outside on the roof.

It was February (in Winnipeg...let that sink in for a moment) and we had to climb up to the observatory deck one at a time. 

I was next to last, freezing to goddamn death, but when I got up there and peered at Jupiter and then Saturn, I damn near cried.

I still feel that same sense of awe and wonder that I felt then when I remember that I SAW those two planets with MY eyes. Fucking magical.Because Saturn is 1.2 billion km away, this is a photo of Saturn as it was 1 hour and 7 minutes ago.you'd think we could get color pictures of the moon by now! it's 2014!It looks so far away holy shit, hard to imagine billions of more galaxys not just the milky way! Fuck Saturn! Smug bastard is always flaunting his giant rings. We should launch all of our trash into orbit around earth until we finally have bigger rings than that pretentious gas giant asshole.You should post to /r/spaceporn as well.This probably won't go anywhere but when I was in Kona, Hawaii a few years back my family and I went to the [Mauna Kea visitor center](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/uploads/SuperSizerTmp/mastheads/DPP_0002PS.-w730-h350-p0-q85-F-----S1-ctrue.jpg?1289266928) (9,200ft) located below the summit of the [Mauna Kea observatories](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Mauna_Kea_observatory.jpg) (13,796ft). 

They pull out big telescopes every night for planet and star gazing, but the night we went, it was cloudy. People had been there for hours and around 11 o'clock most people had given up and left. We stuck it out for another half hour with another two families and the clouds finally cleared. At that point it became a 1 on 1 with the telescope operator who was able to point out various constellations and planets. 

My favorite moment was when he finally located Jupiter. I used my iPhone to take [this photo of Jupiter and four of its largest moons](https://scontent-b-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/383413_3577801208397_1267678942_n.jpg) through the lens of the telescope. It doesn't do it justice because viewing with your eye, you could actually make out the red spot (storm) on Jupiter. Seeing Jupiter with my own eyes was surreal after having only previously seen photos of it online and in books. It was easily one of the coolest experiences I've had while on vacation and I *highly* encourage you to check it out if you ever visit the big island.My first thought was how it was fascinating that there were no stars in between the two. My second thought was that I'm not clever.What is this? A Planet for ANTS?!Funny, in vision neuroscience would use the word ""occluded"" when one object blocks another from view, but in astronomy when something blocks something else apparently it's called ""occulted"". 

I wonder how this relates to ""the occult"" 

edit: From wiki:

>The occult (from the Latin word occultus ""clandestine, hidden, secret"") is ""knowledge of the hidden"". In common English usage, occult refers to ""knowledge of the paranormal"", as opposed to ""knowledge of the measurable"", usually referred to as science.

I volunteered at a thrift store and worked in the incoming book donations area. We were allowed to throw damaged and unsellable books into a recycled textiles bin, but were only supposed to do so sparingly. Basically, if the book was in good shape we were supposed to put a price tag on it and attempt to sell it. We're talking about hundreds of books, multiplied times several bins.

Over the course of just one day, I lost count of the number of outdated computer-related manuals I saw. Windows 3.1 for Dummies. Windows 95 for dummies. Windows 98 for Dummies. Old books related to old Mac OSes named after animals. Legitimate literature for outdated programs that might have been super useful 20 years ago but had no chance in hell of making a sale, and would simply be wasting precious book space. But in near perfect condition! 

I wasted no time and simply tossed all of it right into recycling. It made me kind of sad, realizing how many books get written, published, bought and slighly used, but then often sit on a book shelf or in a box and eventually get donated and forgotten.

I was credited with being especially efficient at dealing with book donations.

http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/25982250/baby-coyote-in-ft-worth-mistaken-for-dogThe photos, and concept scream adorable!!

After reading the story... it's depressing. Full of shock and awe, disease, and death! The end. When I was a teenager, my younger brother found a ""stray dog"" in the woods behind his school.  It was a cute little pup, very strange looking, but incredibly playful and all-around adorable.  We were constantly looking up pictures of different breeds, trying to figure out what the hell he was.  After about a week, he lets loose his first howl.  If you've every heard a coyote howl (even from a pup), you know right away that it did not come from a domesticated house dog.  That was a wild creature.  After that, it just took a quick google image search to confirm that we had a coyote pup on our hands.

The worst thing about finding an animal like that is that vets (in Texas, at least) are legally barred from doing anything for coyotes.  No vaccines.  No checkups.  No heartworm meds.  No emergency services.  We were lucky enough that my dad knew someone with a farm that didn't mind looking after the pup until it could run off on it's own.  Or my dad's a liar and had the coyote pup was put down... I'll never know for sure, so I choose the happier ending to that story.Yay! I know her! I used to work with her at a Mexican restaurant in Fort Worth. Behind the employee parking lot, there is a big field that looks like it was cleared years ago for a new building, but never made it. All kinds of animals end up trapped back there. Cheyenne said that she knew it was a coyote when she got close to it, but felt like she needed to help it anyway. A bunch of people out here are pissed off about the vet killing it instead of sending it to one of the many sanctuaries within an hour of Fort Worth. It's really a sad story and people are telling her that she's stupid for not knowing it was a coyote, but she knew once she got close enough to it. She tried to do the right thing, but the city ended up just euthanizing it. I will post a picture that she posted to facebook yesterday with coyote where she found it. ""I named him *Bitey*"" One of my sister's friends was on the highway driving home from work and the car in front of her hits a dog. The other guy keeps going so she stops and bundles up the poor little guy, who is knocked out cold but otherwise mostly intact, and swings off the next exit to the nearest vet office. She's afraid to move him any more than she already has so she runs inside to grab someone. When she comes back out with the vet assistant the ""dog"" is going completely apeshit in the car, tearing the upholstery to shreds, shitting, pissing and bleeding on everything.

The assistant looks at her and says ""ummm, *that's* a coyote"", calls animal control and the cops, who show up and shoot it through her passenger side window. The car was completely totaled. Moral of the story is that people should probably at least look up coyotes on wikipedia or something if you haven't had exposure to them before.I'd love to adopt that puppy, but [my cat that I rescued from a dumpster](http://dixiebonespost.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/possum1.jpg) isn't very friendly with other pets.I tried to save a baby coyote once.

Sometimes I wish I could hold up a sign that says ""I have MD sorry I'm slow, please don't honk or yell at me."" Summing up a lot of lazy observations/questions people had:

Singapore is a small, modern country that is wealthy and somewhat authoritarian.  Implementing these devices utilize already existing technology from their public transport systems that are widely used by the population.  Seniors utilize a specific form of this card, in this case allowing them to make use of extended crosswalk times, when necessary.  Almost everyone in Singapore speaks English, it is their primary language, but it is also supplemented with their choice of a more regional language as well.  These are necessary because similar to other industrialized Asian countries, peak traffic times are hectic.  They simply must be efficient, but not without also protecting the elderly/disabled.  In Norway (or at least in the cities in norway), there is a button on the bottom of the i-want-to-cross button box, and if you press it the crosswalk light stays green for a longer time.

No need for cards or anything.In the U.S., people would be bitching about 'forcing' the handicapped to have to carry around a card just to make the crossing light longer. A great idea, but I wonder how much it would cost to implement.English is the primary language in Singapore?Seriously though, I haven't seen anyone use that before.

Source: I live in SingaporeTIME EXTENDEDTraffic Engineer here.  I spent last summer working for the SFMTA (San Francisco) designing signal timing plans that would accommodate the handicapped and elderly at crosswalks. Great and all, but very inefficient timing scheme that takes away precious seconds from vehicular traffic phases.  This Singapore example in a sense is semi-actuation, and has a preset extension of pedestrian phase time in the signal controller.  Probably gives about 2.0 to 2.5 ft/s walking/moving speed across the road, where as during non-handicapped and elderly ped phases, it can accommodate closer to 3.5/4.0 ft/s and use less time in the vehicular phase. I love it, maybe I'll bring it up in SF this summer!

TL;DR: More efficient signal timing plan with pedestrian semi-actuation. Singapore gets a lot right. Was out there for the first time last week, can't help but feel like when the world goes to shit Singapore will still be fine.

EDIT: I'm aware that Singapore also gets a lot wrong, but the fact that they've got to where they are today with no natural resources is impressive for a country the size of the Isle of Wight. At first glance I thought it was for credit cards, as in you had to pay to cross the road.This strikes me as less for the disabled, and more for the motorists.  Let's be honest, you're going to take as long as it takes to get across the street.  But if you're only half-way through, I doubt some motorist is gonna gun you down mid-stride.  What *will* happen is the light will turn green, the guy behind the wheel will see he's ""missing"" his light, and he's gonna get pissed.  The extra red light time will make them not notice the frustration of the person taking so long to cross.Singapore = best place on earth. My friend from high school actually holds the US patent on this. It wasn't a card, it was a different kind of token (a radio fob, I believe). Using a token to increase walk cycles at traffic lights is absolutely what she implemented and patented. My grandmother was killed about 20 years ago because the light changed while she was crossing a 4 lane highway to get back to her apartment. I'm glad things like this exist now.They probably also shortened the regular crossing time . . .As a brit, this is really weird to me. It's hammered into your skull when you're learning to drive and whilst studying for the theory test that it's against the highway code to bully and harass pedestrians that are taking 'too long' to cross the road. You can't drive around them, you don't honk the horn, you don't gesture, you don't shout. You're told if you see someone old crossing, expect them to take longer and just wait, you impatient motorhead.I lived in Singapore/Malaysia for a while and in addition to Singapore having more money than they know what to do with, those people respect their elders. Level 9000 shit.The main problem I see with this is the expense of implementation.   Not only issuing the cards, educating the public and all, but changing out the crosswalk signal buttons.   That could cost a fortune.   I looked at the picture before I read the title, and I thought someone had implemented a real-life F2P/freemium street-crossing system. This is.. Brilliant. Wish more places had this!

As a driver in LA, I have seen the impatience. I personally have no problems with pedestrians. But the problem is witj pedestrians who don't follow the rules... You're not supposed to enter the crosswalk when there are only a few seconds left on the crosswalk. In those instances, if you must cross, you should hurry so that you don't hold up traffic. I've seen too many people enter the crosswalk when there are only a few seconds left, and then they take their sweet time. So that most of their walk is against the red hand, which is technically not allowed (please correct me if I'm wrong - this is what I've gathered from common sense).

The problem with waiting patiently is you never get to make that turn, because the light turns and then you have other cars to battle. And then the light turns and pedestrians go again. 

Everyone needs to follow the rules, not just drivers. Because once those lights turn green, it's open season on pedsYou know, I saw this without reading the title, and thought it was a clever anti-Net Neutrality propaganda sticker. Pass your credit card for extra walk time / shorter wait.It looks like it gives them a speed boost.","{'Sadness': 0.057093, 'Emotional_Range': 0.798, 'Tentative': 0.532, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.947339, 'Analytical': 0.3, 'Conscientiousness': 0.142, 'Agreeableness': 0.473, 'Joy': 0.046073, 'Disgust': 0.071125, 'Extraversion': 0.529, 'Openness': 0.29, 'Anger': 1.0}",{}

Goddard! That's who Jimmy Neutron named his dog after! Good ole Worcester (born and raised)That's not in the fairway[deleted]Robert Goddard was my childhood hero.  I read everything I could get my hands on about him and his work.  I entered science fairs with model rockets based off his designs(not working models of course).
As it turns out, I eventually married into his family.  My wife is a Goddard.  I had forgotten all about him by the time this happened, and it wasn't until at a family reunion that I realized what I had done.  
Now I try to get my kids to learn about him and his contribution to science.  Maybe it will spark their minds like it did mine.I'm sure this gets buried but....

My school had one of his lab notebooks in the library and my chemistry professor would always talk about how crazy he was. 

""Tested new rocket fuel today. Rocket went over 300 yards before landing in a group of people and exploding. Successful test""

""Mixed new fuel combination together. Went to lounge to take nap while solution settled. Woke up to explosion. Lab roof missing. ""

What up Worcester! Auburn?Is it at least 150 out so they could kill two birds with one stake/obelisk?Reminds me of October Sky such a good movie.Many Nazi scientists who developed the V-1 and V-2 rockets (to bomb London) were taken by the Americans at the end of WWII. When asked how they figured out how to make such rockets, they said they learned everything from Dr.Goddard's work. The Americans had no idea who that was.The late great Wernher von Braun, inventor of the V2 rocket for Hitler and head of the US manned space program, was once asked where he learned about rockets. His answer, ""Robert Goddard.""Pretty cool. Where?What's the ruling on that? Do you get a club-length of relief when you're right up against it?Where in the Worcester area?What's up, townie?? Small world.  
  
My great aunt was Dr. Goddard's secretary. She transcribed his notes. So, basically, you're welcome for the rockets.That's actually really awesome. [Reminds me of this great comic about the guy.](http://1j74duke02o49spu52ub76g1bzq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-07-17-goddard.jpg)

I told my boyfriend to pull over. 
""How many customers have you had today?"" I said.
""You're the first!"" she said cheerfully. She was gap toothed, with messy hair- a bit like Ellie from Up.
 
""How long have you been out here?"" I asked.
""A few hours.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll take one drawing, please. Draw whatever you'd like.""
Her eyes got huge. ""REALLY??? Okay- what's your favorite animal?""
""A penguin.""
""Please come back in about 10 minutes.""

So we drove around for 10 minutes. When I got back, she proudly presented me with a drawing of a penguin playing in a rock band with other penguins.
""I love it."" I said. ""Perfect!""

""That will be one dollar, but you can give me 50 cents if you don't want to pay a dollar,"" she said.

I handed her a $20. ""keep the change. Just promise me you'll never stop drawing, okay? No matter what anyone tells you. Always do what you love to do.""
 Her eyes got wide and she ran in the house and yelled ""MOM MOM! MY DRAWING SOLD FOR $20! THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE""

""Gtfo.""I had 2 little boys come to my door asking for work to do for money. I was ELATED since I was so tired and had to move out soon but still had weeds and leaves to pull up and rake so I asked them how much they charge. They said like a buck or two and I told them if they get all the leaves and weeds in an area maybe 30ft by 60 ft and my sidewalk, I'd give them $10 each and they can use my tools and gloves and everything. The job usually takes me an hour so two kids I was thinking would be no problem.

Well, the older one made his younger brother futily drag a hoe to dig up the weeds (he simply wasn't heavy or strong enough to even break the loose soil) as the older one did really menial shit like picking a few weeds here and there by hand.

After what was like a couple hours of me cleaning up the inside, they knocked on the door and told me they were finished. YES! I step out and look around and... not a god damned thing was any different than before they showed up. The bin had like 10 stray weeds in it and a couple handful of weeds. I don't even understand how they spent that much time not doing anything. I gave them some ice water and a few bucks each but talk about being ripped off.

I ended up spending $1500 on a couple of Mexican guys to completely trim the trees and do all the yard cleanup I needed and take it to the dump. After I got my deposit back, I broke even.

But shit, when I was those kids' age I would have busted my ass and did a much better job for lower pay than what they tried to pull.

Other countries were screaming for it, countries that had the money and resources to support their people AND organise a large event, but for some ungodly reason the olympic commitee insisted it needed to be in Brazil. Here's my problem with these protests. The time for them was a few years ago when Brazil announced it would be trying to get the WC, not now when literally nothing can stop it. Don't get me wrong, I agree with the protesters, but what are they hoping to accomplish with this?let's buy billion dollar submarines! *crickets*wont the world cup raise a shit ton of money? I could be wrongBrazilian here. As much as I love my country, most of the people that are protestings nowadays, are only doing for social media. The big protest that happened about 1 year ago, because of the bus fare, that didnt had a raise in a couple of years, got a BRZ$0,20 raise. They stopped many of the major cities, Sao Paulo, where I live was catastrophic. One of the supervisor, where I used to work, was gathering people on our company to take them to the protest, but people that never used a public transportation on their lives. What I find ridiculous, is that, because of 20 cents they stopped most of the major cities. But when we get an announcement from our Federal Police that they are investigating a major corruption cartel (Petrobras) people dont do shitt. The worst thing in this country is the corruption. You could take the entire money from what was invested in the World Cup and invest DIRECTLY into education, public safety and healthcare and still wouldnt do, because a big part of the money would end up in corruption with overprice of everything. 

These people, in my honest opinion, SHOULD STOP PROTESTING against world cup, 20 cents on the bus fare, or anything else and go straight against corruption. Interesting sign, considering 99% of the population speaks Portuguese (the official language of Brazil)... Makes sense that this is the protest photo that makes it to the top of redditI spent six months in Brazil in 2011 and the mood was already somewhat somber, but people seemed to be giving the regime the benefit of the doubt. All of that has escalated into full-blown fury after the large-scale theft beneath the World Cup was revealed. Browsing the Brazil-related subs there's more of the same.I can't wait to go to Brazil and party my ass off for the world cup. I'm going to dump at least $4000 into their economy.The Olympics have jumped the shark in terms of hosting them. How many facilities projects sit idle and in disrepair? It's just a tremendous drain on an economy to put on the level of spectacle that the world expects today.

Simple Solution.


Pick a country as a permanent host to donate land that will become international in ownership. Every country chips in to build and upkeep permanent Olympic facilities. The country that donated the land may lease the facilities between Olympics (or other international competitions) if they wish as a stream of revenue. Possible others could as well. Hosting duties can still rotate amongst the differing countries where they gain all the same privileges as a host country and the same responsibilities. This way countries can still showcase themselves while their citizens do not have to foot the bill for facilities that they do not need or want. This would also open hosting up to countries that would not normally be able to accommodate for various reasons. Perhaps paying for flights and lodging for a number of citizens would be a cheaper alternative to stack stands full of host citizens to cheer on their athletes.

Just a thought.All they need is 2 million dollars and 30 clowns.Have people been protesting since 2007? when Brazil was selected?  Or did they wait for Billions of dollars be spent first?  Native Brazilians who had the opportunity to study in a first world school will agree that our public schools suck really really really bad. I'm Sao in Paulo and it doesn't look like things are going to change in a very long time (in fact, our public education used to be better at the past, meaning it is getting worse).

Thing is; we claim for education but the only way to properly fight for it is to educate people. Don't you think the government knows that?I went to World Youth Day in Brazil last summer (6 million visitors in rio de janiero). Security was great and the transportation was smooth. I felt safer walking around the streets their at 2 am than the streets of my native city Chicago. This guy's gonna love the next Olympics.It makes me pretty sad the current situation of my fellow brazilians, I'm also South American, and I hate to see how our governments are so stupid as to take this kind of decissions. 

South Africa's WC consumed 3 billion dollars (and it was the greatest expenditure in any WC till the moment) in order to function and they expected to recover all of it and even a lot of revenue, but they didn't and now those stadiums are sitting there rotting and consuming more resources...Current Brazil's WC costs 11 Billion Dollars and it surpasses by far the 3 billion of South Africa, they expect to recover everything from tourism and even get a revenue. 

I love Brazilians, they are the most wonderfull people in the world but what is currently happening makes me sad and I hope everything works for the best.  

Also what about FIFA's position in this, they just let a country invest like crazy in these type of events and they just get their pockets even more full?

I wonder where is logic, ethic and simple common sense?As someone who lives in London and was very much skeptical of the 2012 Olympics, the games were truly one of the best experiences of my life. Obviously Brazil has deeper structural issues, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the WC and Olympics will be F'ing epic despite all the reddit hate Smile for the camera.  Look mum, I'm protesting.Well, if he thinks that education, for instance, would benefit from the money spent on the World cup, he is mistaken.

[The total cost is estimated to be the same as a month's worth of education spending.](https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=pt-BR&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.folha.uol.com.br%2Fpoder%2F2014%2F05%2F1458720-custo-da-copa-equivale-a-um-mes-de-gastos-com-educacao.shtml)Is that Ronaldinho bottom right on poster??i could be wrong, but isn't Brazil 100% energy independent? I travelled Brazil for a month and didn't notice any of what this guy has on his sign. I went to some of the schools and they were better than here in Canada. I felt pretty safe walking the same types of places that I would in Canada. The public transport worked good for me, in fact Curitiba Brazil has one of the best transit systems in the world.

I am actually excited about the World Cup and the Olympics in Brazil because I have hope that it will put Brazil in the spotlight of the world and maybe help it to improve its situation.","{'Sadness': 0.062472, 'Emotional_Range': 0.85, 'Tentative': 0.548, 'Confident': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.058768, 'Analytical': 0.251, 'Conscientiousness': 0.176, 'Agreeableness': 0.355, 'Joy': 0.058955, 'Disgust': 0.087033, 'Extraversion': 0.356, 'Openness': 0.483, 'Anger': 0.970875}","{'protest': 0.331812, 'sport': 0.310026, 'forever the sickest kids': 0.268941, 'person': 0.845535}"

Also, why is the fourth one so juicy?This is honestly really, really cool! Better than 99% of wikipedia images. 

I'm horrified of wasps, but this is truly fascinating to see.In an alternate universe, a giant wasp kills an entire human city. It then poses fetuses in ascending order of development, takes a picture, and posts it on a wasp social media website for imaginary points.

Despite it being OC, another wasp calls him a fag.That is a  *Polistes* sp. (probably *exclamans*) Wasp. They are semi-social (as opposed to eusocial) insects. They have a dominant female which is the ""queen"" and the have cooperative brood care and caste differentiation, but not overlapping generations (the nest is destroyed after 1 season). This fact makes them different from truly eusocial hymenoptera like honey bees and ants. Often it is her sisters that serve the dominant female. The dominant female can be overthrown by her sisters sometimes. What you are seeing is only 3 stages, the larva, pupa, and adult (missing the egg stage). The pupae you posted are going through melanization where the cuticle darkens and hardens. I would have been really impressed if you were able to find the parasitic wasps that infest their brood cells [*Elasmus* spp. (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)]. In some of the cells if you open them carefully 100's of *Elasmus* will be in there. They are very effective parasitoids.

So I gave up.Evolution of a BeedrillFucking aliensThe life cycle of Nope.That is terrifying but extremely cool. were they separated evenly by different stages of growth? To elaborate, were they grouped in clusters by developmental stage, or were they all mixed together? Think I may draw this.  Cool.What was it like looking pure evil in the face?How big was the nest?Wasps are really cool. I wish I could be a wasp bro. Not someone who fucks up the innocent but someone who has gained the trust and respect of the wasps, who is allowed to mingle among them and partake in their wasp ceremonies. We could be really excellent buds, the wasps and I. Slowly I could teach the wasps who was cool and who deserves the terror that can only be instilled by a gang of wasps coming to fuck your shit up. With that lesson the wasps would become not feared but respected as a peace-keeping force. Let's see how tough those gangbangers and jihadists are with some wasps in their stockings.I'm pretty sure those are not wasps, rather hornets.  That means each stage of that is pure undiluted hate of all things living.This will probably get buried, but one of my most horrific childhood experiences involved wasps.

When I was a kids I enjoyed collecting nature related stuff and putting it in a clear plastic box divided into different sections. One day I found a wasp nest on the ground. I looked like it fell and was abandoned for sometime ago so I decided to put it in one of the little square dividers inside my box. It fit perfectly into the divider and was one of the last nature related things I put in my box before storing it away in my closest for the winter.

About 3 months later I was cleaning out my closest and found the box. To my shock there were about 10 perfectly preserved dead wasps inside the box pressed against the clear plastic. As an eight year old the idea of a dozen bugs living their short little life cycle in my closest was terrifying. Let alone me picking up a live wasp nest. I put the box away in the garage where it and all if its asphyxiated wasps sit in a tupperware container to this day 15 years later. 

I don't ever want to open or see that clear box ever again.That last cycle is Gigantus Assholus. For you geeky folk.I bet those larvae are nice and chewy, like a gummy bear. Maybe the reason they're so angry is because they have to stay straight for so long.

They've repressed their true selves by the time they finally come out.This reminds me of when I killed a wasp nest, then dug it out and  
my dad (foolishly) kept in the garage. We came back a few days  
later to find wasps all over the garage, but they seemed pretty docile.  

So I'm curious how much of their behavior is innate versus learned  
or programmed by other members? If some or all of their behavior  
is learned, at which stage in this cycle do they develop it?","{'Sadness': 0.045037, 'Emotional_Range': 0.928, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.055, 'Fear': 0.615376, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.071, 'Agreeableness': 0.455, 'Joy': 0.049847, 'Disgust': 0.338692, 'Extraversion': 0.552, 'Openness': 0.299, 'Anger': 0.935044}","{'sand': 0.331812, 'beach': 0.731059}"

Looks like it's [this little corner of the canyon here.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Canyon+National+Park/@36.0272579,-111.6555017,42760a,35y,180h/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1f38a9bec9912029) Looks like the main canyon would have been right underneath your plane and therefore out of your window view.

If you look around that map a bit, you can see just how much the main canyon dwarfs what is shown here.

To make up for being a party pooper, [here's another cool picture of the Grand Canyon](http://i.imgur.com/WKd6dGE.jpg)Yep that's a crack alrightI went to the Grand Canyon once. It was a good story. I was about 12 and my parents signed us up for a helicopter tour of the canyon. Upon entering the small helicopter, the pilot informed us that he was a military Blackhawk pilot who was currently off duty. I am an only child, so along with my parents, another young couple rode with us. We were five in total, plus the pilot. I was riding shotgun with the pilot, who was showing me the controls and telling me how bad this bird was compared to his blackhawk at work. 

When we reached the canyon, the young couple with us realized they had made a huge mistake. We were above one of the wider portions when the pilot asks me if I had ever been to zero Gs. Before I could answer he immediately dropped us straight into the cayon. My glasses came off my face and drifted into the backseat. The woman in the other couple immediately vomits into the provided bag. I'm laughing like a maniac. There is a place in the canyons with a triangle-shaped crevice. The pilot goes full speed and takes us straight through it. The woman literally screams because she thinks we're going to die. At this point my dad, the pilot, and I are the only ones having a good time. The pilot asks the woman in the back if she's feeling alright from the first drop. Before she can answer he does it again. He's flying as fast as fucking possible through this canyon, getting insanely close to the walls and other rock formations. I can see people walking along the canyon pointing at our heli as he's going full retard. The woman sitting by my mom is sobbing at this point. 

When we landed he gave me a shell from a test-firing of the door guns of 'his' blackhawk. He told my dad that they let him keep the shells to give to kids who don't cry when he flies them around.


10/10 would do againIf this is the Grand Canyon it must be at the very end of the canyon, the heart of the canyon is so much bigger than this.Jeez, when are they gonna fill that in?Once I was on a flight from Vegas to Houston and we passed over the grand canyon and one of the passengers asked the flight attended if it was the equator.I can't believe it's only 6000 years old!
I never went to the Grand Canyon, but I did have one of [these.](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~srs/Ken/B001-B999/B568_G3a.gif)Awesome.  I'd always assumed the Grand Canyon was a crappy, crowded tourist attraction.  After seeing it in person for the first time a couple years ago, I was amazed.  Truly breathtaking.  She is grand, and she is canyonLook what Jesus did!Water, H2O, Ice, Steam, Power. It's incredible the effect that three atoms could have on the entirety of our existence. Hydrogen, Oxygen, Life, Death, Destruction, Creation. It's the Alpha and the Omega. I wish one day to be a fraction as important and powerful as water, even for only a moment, think of what I could create, think of the impact I could have if I was water for only a second of your life. I know now what I'll always strive towards. I hope the pilot said something; I was on a flight between Chicago and Korea once and out of boredom I looked out the window and saw some aurora borealis. It wasn't as impressive as many of the pictures with clear lines/streams of aurora, it was mostly just a green blur, but I thought it was really cool. I kept looking around to see if anyone else noticed and waited for the pilot to say something (how often do most people get to see aurora in person?!), but most people were sleeping and the pilot never said anything. Maybe it was a safety thing and they didn't want everyone rushing to one side of the plane to see out the windows? Either way I was kinda surprised the pilot didn't tell anyone. Maybe I caught it at a bad time, and if I had noticed 10 minutes earlier it would have been much more beautiful.

It'd be cool if there were cameras on the outside of the plane and you could use the screens to view them. Like one on the nose, one on each wing looking out, and one looking down (of course their feeds could be disabled at certain times/etc.). I guess it'd be pretty pointless most of the time (especially flying over oceans), but it'd be cool at other times.

Or if airlines combined the flight map with google maps so you could zoom in and see if you're near any landmarks instead of having to wonder, ""hey, is that _____?"" Plus, you could get a better idea of the ground distance you're covering. It's impossible to really comprehend the distance being covered when your map shows the airplane you're in as the same size as Florida...For those of you that don't know that [this giant NOPE exists...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_Skywalk)What is that, the grand canyon for ants?I was at the Grand Canyon with my family when I was younger.  We were taking pictures and I noticed a young woman standing by herself really close to the edge, looking out with tears streaming down her face.  I walked up next to her and quietly asked, ""Is everything alright, Miss?""  She replied, ""It's all just so beautiful.""I need to visit the Grand Canyon.That angle helps with the perspective.. I appreciate the Grand Canyon that much more. Seeing all this flat land and crevice that's been carved out over millions of years.

One of the things he said that stood out to me was being separated from his family and sent to an ""english"" school when he was about 12. After a couple weeks he said ""Fuck this"" and walked 70 miles, barefoot, across the desert back to his home. Pretty badass but makes you think how awfully we treated native americans in the early 20th century.[removed]Chester Nez was not the last of the Navajo Code Talkers, he was the last surviving member of the original 29 Navajo Code Talkers. 

Much respect.  RIP. What's a navajo code talker? Aheehee Hastiin Nez for upholding and using Diné Bizaad during a time of turmoil for all people. Your strength, story, heroism and our language will continue to live on, and passed down generation to generation. May your journey into the Spirit World be a great one.

Here's an interview Diné College did with Chester Nez:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAlNguQju4QLooks like a gentle soulI met him in 2012 at a convention in Baltimore. He was the ""guest of honor"" for the military contractor NOVA Corp. Folks were walking past their booth not paying him any mind, but I knew who he was. 

I knew my military history and was shocked to see him in person (honestly, I thought all of them had died out shortly after the Bush years). I walked right up to him and I said, ""Sir I have to say it's an honor to meet you. What you've done for this country, has had a huge impact on me and my family."" I went on about how it was a disservice the way the country treated him and his fellow Native-American's when they returned home, but that the history books had been re-written in my generation and that we knew quite well about the work he did. I told him that even today in DoD we still use a lot of the code-words and Navajo terms.

Though he had clearly had a stroke and was remanded to a wheelchair, he squeezed my hand tightly and opened his eyes wide and smiled at me. He mumbled something to his nurse, who said he was happy to have met me as well.

The United States owes him, and his people, a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid.The code talkers did not only a great service to the US, but also to the world in general.  If anyone is curious [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425247856/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=164YDKK2N80CDZKY2K5W&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1688200382&pf_rd_i=507846) is a good book describing what they did, and more specifically Chester's part in it.  I hope he lived the rest of his days happy and comfortable.rest in peace.    
learning about what you accomplished during history was pretty magical.    

A good man. Thanks, code talker. Sad to see him go, RIP and thanks for all the great work.This man was exceptional among exceptional people, I hope his name, his values, and his contributions and sacrifices are remembered more vividly and by more people. It's the only immortality I can verify, he deserves it.Helped save the government who once persecuted his people by speaking from the heritage that his people were persecuted for.My dad was his hospice nurse for his last days.  He tried to do everything he could to make his passing easier.People often talk about why Native Americans fight for a country that was overtaken by others. The statement is that this land of United States still is theirs, so they should still fight for it. It isn't about resources or land management, it is about where you were born and people before it. Native Americans are the foundation of this country, and they so ever be to protect it. This is a fucking comment graveyard. Have some goddamned respect.His autobiography was fascinating.  He had a rough life outside of the war also.While I respect our soldiers ridiculously, I especially admire ones like Mr. Nez, the 442nd Infantry Regiment, and other minority soldiers who gave it all for a country that didn't want to give much back. They gave their lives so that bigots back at home could have the freedom to hate them. Dude looks like he's still keeping a secret.legend These were men who lent their language to a government who had been, and continued to, oppress their people in some pretty terrible ways.

If you ever want an example of ""ask not what your country can do for you,"" you're not going to do better than that. This guy came and spoke at my high school (or more accurately, his son/grandson spoke for him while he sat there smiling) The way they explained how the military came to these guys and had them build this unbreakable code based on such a unique language was both funny and inspiring. 

We laughed when they humorously explained that the super secret word for airplane was just Navajo for bird. And I really felt like I was shaking the hand of a hero when given the opportunity. 

Now that they've all passed on I feel really lucky to have gotten to hear the exploits of this man and his compatriots while he was sitting right there.

Especially now.here's an HD picture of how it looks with the [lights off](http://blacklabelsociety.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/spacer.jpg)Story time:

I went to Orlando last year with my girlfriend. We did Disney towards the end of the trip. I am deathly afraid of coasters and will not go on one. I have total BA Baracus fear of flying anxiety. You'd have to drug me with some laced milk.

She suggests we go on Space Mountain. I have no idea what it really is and assume it's maybe a kiddie coaster. I agree after asking her **to confirm this**. We wait in line for like 40 minutes and finally inch our way up to a car. I barely fit (6'5"" / 255lbs at the time). I was crammed in like it was a fucking bobsled.

The car starts to move forward slowly. Then a car comes **flying** down the track in the opposite direction, and it hits me that this girl, the love of my life, tricked my stupid ass into getting onto a coaster.

I turn around and say to her ""I am not happy with this"". She laughs like I'm a fucking comedian. Commence panic mode and a few minutes of me tucking my long-ass legs up as much as possible because I was in the dark and had no idea what was above or below me. I tried my best to be fetal in my flying bobseld of Disney death.

Now I see this picture and all of these emotions come flooding back. Shit is gonna get real when I get home.Just like my girlfriend it looks better with the lights off.I actually find this more frightening. Ric Flair is upset that you turned on the lights.I'd say you just ruined my childhood but a touchy balloon clown already took care of that.Looks like the inside of The missile tube base from metro 2033.

At that time, literally the only ride that could be called ""thrilling"", that reached speeds above 3 mph, was the monorail from the parking lot. All else was what are known as dark rides, slow rides with some animitronic antics thrown in. But all over the park were signs telling me that Space Mountain would open in January. I knew I'd never see it. This was a one time trip to Florida from my native Texas. While I later had lots of fun at Astroworld, I always wondered about Space Mountain.

I've had anger issues with Disney ever since.A lot less spacey and a lot less mountainy/u/chrono1465, the ruiner of dreamsWorked for a week as an outside contractor at DisneyWorld. One of the imagineers who was behind the design of Space Mountain got to chatting with me. I told him about my love of the ride and how cool it was that they used fans to simulate speed when the car was barely moving. He confided with me that those first few months the HVAC guys were complaining that the filters needed changing earlier than usual. They were caked with a white 'powder'. Turned out to be dandruff and dead skin being blown off of the passengers in the ride....if only I knew what it looked like with the lights off.  Thanks mom and dad.Yeah, Its scary as fuck when the lights come on and your zooming through there. I ducked my head the whole time. Oldest ride, longest line.I actually got to ride Space Mountain this way a few years back, and I have to say.. It's a lot worse than when the lights are offI went on that ride twice.  The first time was amazing!  The second time... the ride broke down half-way through the trip.  They had to come rescue us and turn on all of the lights.  Really killed the immersion.  I can't wait to be not so fat that I'm afraid to try to ride coasters. I'm pretty sure I would be fine on most coasters... But getting denied once was enough. Most embarrassing thing every. By next summer, I'll be all set.","{'Sadness': 0.051007, 'Emotional_Range': 0.905, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.268, 'Fear': 0.98041, 'Analytical': 0.0, 'Conscientiousness': 0.174, 'Agreeableness': 0.729, 'Joy': 0.057618, 'Disgust': 0.04183, 'Extraversion': 0.649, 'Openness': 0.182, 'Anger': 0.898032}",{'architecture': 0.28905}

Edit- i can't believe this is my most popular comment, and i wasn't even racially correct. Thanks guys...?Cats think it's bad luck to have a black person cross their path. It's an old superstition. this is pretty cute. cats are like babies, if it's outside their sphere of experience they're curious.

""Hey, hey buddy! Can you see me? Haha... blind fuck head. What if I swiped those glasses from your head. What would you do then, hey? Hahaha!!""

Your cat's a bit of a douche-bag, frankly. I had a blue heeler that had a completely irrational fear of black people. He was horrified by them and didn't know what to think of them. I have no idea why since I had him from a weened puppy and I don't ever know of a black person mistreating him.

Once, I had my heeler and my lab mix in the backseat of my car and we pulled up at a red light next to a van full of black people. My heeler went nuts, growling and barking and bashing his head against the back side window. This caused the lab mix to go nuts, though she didn't even know what all the fuss was about and started barking out the back window. For all my scolding and screaming the dogs wouldn't stop. The black people were looking at me with their mouths open in disbelief as if they thought this was something I had taught the dogs. My car was literally rocking from all the commotion from the dogs.

I was so embarrassed I could have crawled into a hole. When the light turned green I gunned it. But I felt like those people in the van thought I was some kind of white supremist or in the KKK or a Nazi or something. That was the longest red light I have ever sat through in my life.
[deleted]Don't be so negative, guys. Maybe the cat was black in a past life and wanted to connect with a brother.I'm actually curious what the cat finds so intriguing.  Does the friend have pets?  Or is it simply because he's black, and looks different?  I'm genuinely interested in knowing.I had an orange tabby , lived to 22. He looked just like that one, even with the bent tail. He did the same thing as that one, but he did the same thing to anyone new that had a deep tan or wore a low hat or a scarf around their mouth. I think they just cannot see enough detail or something. Meanwhile, that cat in the picture is happy but inquisitive. Not a hair is up on his back. His ears are upright and his whiskers are forward, like he is walking on his own turf. There are no claws out either. Just curious. My cat never got used to anything that caused that reaction unless it was a paper bag.  

TL;DR:   cat is fine. my cat did same with people w/ tans or hats/scarves, forever.

One of the most amazing things is how ridiculously thorough they are when checking for leaks. It can cost millions of dollars to pull the cable back up to have it replaced.Here's an awesome documentary about a ship that does this kind of cable laying.

 [Tyco Resolute-Mighty Ships](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvlowj_tyco-resolute-mighty-ships-discovery_tech)I would love to see how difficult the termination would be.  I wonder how much voltage drop occurs during the lengthy travel and how often they have step up transformers to keep the voltage up.I forgot what i clicked and thought it was a sushi platter.['Mother Earth Mother Board'](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/ffglass_pr.html) by Neal Stephenson. Really interesting history/travelogue about the laying of undersea telecommunications cable.I bet my dog still chew through itA bit old, but here's a good article by Neal Stephenson on undersea cables.

http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/ffglass_pr.html
I intern at a high voltage manufacturing facility. The massiveness of the cables are amazing. The particular facility I work at manufactures 500kV cables so the spools are about 3 stories high. The cables themselves are about the thickness of my body! There is also an extrusion tower that is the highest structure in the state (about 20 stories high) that they use to test the quality of the cables and then load onto the spools. It is quite impressive. They make that kind of cables in my home town. I was in the factory on a visit once. Some how they are made in a tower, which is also has more underground levels than it does above ground, stretching them out oneway some 650 ft and back again.

[Here's the tower.](http://imgur.com/ABuFzvH)

Ninja edit: Also they are planning a second taller tower next to it.i dunno if i'm allowed to say this, but when i was in the navy- our ship (LHA class) was messed up by some underwater cables and we had to sit in port for a few more days in another country while underwater divers had to get the cables out of our props.  it was accidental.. 

EE major specializing in power electronics here:

This is not a data cable, this is a high voltage (more than 50kV) power cable.

The three center conductors carry the power, one conductor per phase for three phase power. The smaller lone wire may be a fiber line or a coaxial cable for commercial data or utility control signals...I'd need a larger pic to see for sure.

The white plastic around the conductors is most likely cross linked polyethylene or XLPE for short. It has very high dielectric strength which is a fancy way to say it's a bad ass insulator for use with very high voltage.

The thin copper ring is there to equalize the electric flux density to prevent dielectric breakdown. In other words it keeps big clumps of electrons form forming in one spot that might punch a hole in the insulation. 

Around the conductor and the insulation of each conductor themselves is also a ring of black semiconducting material. This helps prevent dielectric breakdown as well by making sure that no air gets trapped between the wires and the insulation. (Air is a good insulator but we need an *awesome* insulator, therefore no air shall be permitted to touch the conductor lest we lose our awesome insulation in that area and risk dielectric breakdown or insulation failure.)

The outer ring is structural and tied to ground. It can also transport leakage current to ground if need be in the event of a cable fault. The tiny one on the left must be Comcast.alright alright, where is the ""how it's made"" episode for this?

Dammit.I actually think chickens are really cute so for me this is cutness level of 'abused dog turnaround' postI worked for a summer in HS for a crew that went from egg farm to egg farm removing all the chickens from the cages (into other cages to be put on a truck to be sent to the soup factory). All the hens were replaced every 5 (?) years with a new crop of chicks.

This is where your eggs come from:

http://www.farmsanctuary.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/batthens10_300_1.jpg

The eggs roll out of the cage (the floor is slightly slanted) and onto a conveyor belt that runs the length of the barn. Machines on one end wash and pack them into egg cartons. Another conveyor brings them feed. It's a pretty neat system (not so much for the chickens though).Yup. Used to do this with my parent's at their house. We'd travel out to a battery farm, pick up a bunch of denuded, straggly looking chickens who were afraid of people.

After a couple of months in a nice coop with a big run, being fed fresh food scraps and grain they'd look like the second picture... and would follow my mum wherever she went.

It was heartwarming.Are you sure it's really the same chicken?  I can't see her feet in the picture on the right, but I'd be surprised to see a bird recover like that.

Source: I raise my own chickens in my back yard.Notice how when a before and after picture of a dog the dog always has a real happy face in the after picture. This chicken has a 1000 yard stare like it was in a tiger cage in Vietnam for 2 years. In the food industry dont let the name ""Free Range"" fool you .. Hey look my chickens are free range they have a window in the building they are in... or cages have dirt floors... *Poof* Free Range.

There is no requirement for access to pasture, and there may be access to only dirt or gravel . Free-range chicken eggs, however, have no legal definition in the United States. Likewise, free-range egg producers have no common standard on what the term means.

All that being said i understand it would be impossible for everyone to eat ""Free Range"" Or ""Pasture Raised""  the amount of land required and the fact that a true ""free\pasture"" raised chicken produces less meat with more resources is not an economical decision.

and its moving here, in about 4 billion years andromeda and milky way will collide, the chance of even two stars from thos systems colliding with each other is very low. the two supermassive black holes(one from milky way and other form andromeda) will position near midle of the new formed galaxy and over millions of years pull each other untill they become one. predicted earth will be near the center before it gets ejected out of the galaxy to be a lonely planet that roams space.

I want this as a wallpaperReally puts into perspective just how bloody, unimaginably HUGE a galaxy really is.  

It would take you over a million years traveling at the speed of light to reach, but because it's so astronomically massive that it appears to be larger than our own moon.

Damn.What is this? A galaxy for ants?!Man that is damn interesting. I never it was so big in comparison. I feel stupid. And small. But mainly stupid.Are there other galaxies like this where if they weren't so dim, they would be visible? Just wondering how big they would look to us in the night sky. Maybe an overlay?I can't even begin to imagine how awesome and humbling this would be. Our world would be a completely different place. Religious and ""is there other life"" arguments change when there's another fucking GALAXY visible to the naked eye every night. I wonder what sort go mythology would have arisin from it....hmmm.Were gonna colllide with Andromeda in a few billion years...That's breathtaking.  How incredibly HUGE a galaxy really is, over 2 million light years and it appears almost close.   As we are on a collision course, can you imagine how fucking impressive it will get?   Sooner or later, it *will* be visible to the naked eye, in all its glory.  Covering more and more space in the night sky.  Becoming the dominant object.  Any way to make this 1920x1080? It would make a great wallpaper!""My God, it's full of stars!""Imagine the movies humans will make about the world ending as the two galaxies collide...haha Should look just like that in about 1 billion years.If you stare in the direction of the Andromeda galaxy long enough, do you get an Andromeda Strain?

Thank you once again for your thoughts and prayers for everyone during this tragic time. It means a lot to all of us here at the SPU community.I know exactly what I would do in this situation. Often when I am bored I sit and think about all the different ways I could diffuse different situations. I look for potential covers and sneak positions. 


I know exactly what I would do in his situation. Shit my pants in fear and cower in the corner.The News should say his name a thousand times and not mention the name of the shooter at all. Did he practice stopping bad guys in violent video games!?Great to hear this one was stopped before more people who injured or killed, but still terrible that this *continues* to be a very real issue.

Pepper spray seems to be a great alternative for those of us who can't or do not wish to carry but would still be willing to intervene.

Bravo to this young man and his courage.This dude better get on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine.> Seattle Mayor Ed Murray identified the student killed as Paul Lee, a ""Korean-American student with a bright future.""

Moment of silence for the victim who was killed.He's getting married in two weeks and still acted 543x more heroically than 99.87% of us will, and that's not a knock on us. No one would have blamed him if he got out of there as fast as he could. THIS is what should be happening!!! 

We should glorify the people who STOP active shooters and give them all the press and make them famous....NOT the active shooter!

Source:  common sense (and I have extensive experience with regard to school safety, active shooters, etc)Heroes should get much more coverage, but still the news always focuses on making the criminal famous.I go to SPU, where this took place, and I can say he's one of the nicest, smartest and now bravest people I know. He had everything to lose when he did this, he didn't have to, he could of waited until the police arrived. Instead he took action, he is and always will be a hero to me.How about some massive news coverage on *this* guy while leaving the shooter to fade into anonymity?He probably thought he'd have to calm down a few drunken frat boys when he signed up for the job.

Nope, just stopping murderers.My favorite part about this is that this guy is getting all the publicity rather than the gunman. You can't see his balls, but you can hear them clink when he walks.  He da real mvpShows what a little situational awareness and a willingness to endanger oneself to protect others can do.

sure, it's not food per se....This is great! I know people are worried about illnesses and such, but if you are starving you're thankfull for anything you can get.

A little story. I don't go out to eat much, can't afford it. My girlfriend and I went out to a really nice vegan place. Neither of us could finish our food but planned on going to the bar after. On the walk to the bar we realized this food wouldn't keep well. So as I was about to throw it in a garbage can, then a man yelled to me. He asked what we had. I explained it was 2 half eaten veggie burgers and some fries. He reached into his pocket and pulled out some change. He held his hand out shaking. Of course I didn't take the money. We gave him the food. Later that night we went out for a cigarette and met up with him again. He said it was the best meal he had in weeks. He insisted that he needed to give us something back. He gave me a drawing he had done on a piece of cardboard. It's framed on my wall.

We can all help eachother. Give what you can. Don't waste. The world is a beautiful place.Now all you need is a public microwave.

Seriously though, this is a very generous and awesome thing to do. Hopefully it doesn't get vandalized by unscrupulous people.My church does something like this -- members of the congregation make extra food and put it in a community fridge (in a room off the church hall). It is easy to make two lasagnas if you are already going to the trouble of making one.  Poor people are welcome to come by the hall at set hours and help themselves. It is sort of like a food bank, I guess, but with prepared meals. [Wikipedia article on Zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat)It's actually an Arab tradition for wealthy families to cook too much food. Leftovers are then left to the poor.  It's a cool way to be subtle about generosity How shitty would you feel if your cooking was so bad even the beggars didn't want it?It looks like the kids are putting the food IN the fridge? .......This is a really nice idea, though the cynic in me says there will be one or two selfish twats that take too much. That's from my experiences in the reduced section at the supermarket ha.It's very interesting that this post has prompted such a consistent response from so many Americans.  I think that in general, it sounds like there is the sense that Americans are generous / want to be generous, but there is a sensitivity to the potential for a small number of individuals to ruin these good intentions.  

Are these suspicious feelings typical of other countries, or is the US fairly unique?  I know that some of the things that people mentioned have actually happened, so these suspicions are not without warrant, but as others keep mentioning, these tend to be relatively rare events.

I'm not trying to say that this suspicion is good or bad--clearly, a bit of suspicion can protect people from lawsuits or harm.  It's just interesting that so many people voiced these concerns which were similar to the concerns I had when I first saw someone suggest that more people in the US should do this.  I wonder how ubiquitous they are.We have the same in our neighborhood. We store food for the poor instead of throwing it in the garbage. 

Edit: I live in Dubai Despite the bad reputation the middle east gets, it is often overlooked that they have many good people as well.  News mostly tells of the negative stuff. At a bus terminal in town during a massive snowstorm, hundreds of people were left stranded.  Someone donated about 100 pizzas to feed people who were stuck there.  about 6 or 7 people grabbed as many pizzas as they could carry, took them back to where they had their luggage, and wouldn't let anyone else have any.  You'd look and there would be ONE guy guarding his 10 precious pizzas...

The thing about giving away free food is that you need to make sure it's somewhat organized, or someone will take advantage of it.  Now that this has hit the media, I expect bad things to follow.In Arrakeen, it used to be customary at banquets for everyone to pour the first goblet of water on the floor. A servant would then mop up the precious water with a towel and bring it to the house gate, where anyone might request a drink. The servant then wrings out the towel into a cup. This was a lovely custom, but it was abolished by Duke Leto Atreides.This is very common in this region, right in front of my house there is a water cooler for everyone.
You put the water cooler on the sidewalk and everyone walking can drink from it.

http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2014/01/11/fire-engulfs-citibank-111th-street-injures-7This is right near my apartment in NYC.  The reason they have the ATM in a truck (a truck surrounded by barriers) is because the actual bank had a pretty substantial fire (the entire building almost burned down), so the bank has been under construction for the past few months... but they wanted to have the ATMs still available.

W 111th and Broadway for those who are curious.  Koronet pizza and Mel's Burgers across the street.Even if it's real... 

""Let's just have a truck, clearly full of money, just sitting around""Thanks for inserting your debit card..... Aaaaand I'm goneThey had mobile ATM banks similar to this in lower Manhattan after Sandy hit.  Could be they're experiencing some long term service outage in the area.Where on earth is this? Does an armored car show up to refill it? Or just a guy on a bicycle with a satchel of cash?That thing has been sketching me out for months. Here's the story: Citibank on Broadway and 110th in New York (UWS) burns down in January so the bank puts this truck outside of their former location to serve as an ATM. The first time that I saw it I thought it was an elaborate scam but in reality it's just a terrifying truck/paint job.

RIP old heights.OPs name is very relevantIt's legit. I live right around the corner. The building to the right of the van (Can't see it in the photo) was a citibank that completely burned down a few months ago. It took almost a day to put the fire out. This van has been up with a temporary ATM since then- there aren't many other citibank's in the neighborhood, so they sort of added one here.

My boyfriend has citibank and uses this ATM all the time. It works.Is that koronet pizza in the back? They have huge slices!That's the rape van for sure. More like shittybank, amiriteIt's because the bank burnt down, dingus.I see you live in my neighborhood. The creepy ATM van reppin Morningside HeightsThere is a super sketchy looking ATM in Allston, MA.  I wish I had a picture of it but its just a single ATM on a stand covered in grafitti.  I believe it makes all of its money  off drunk hipsters.

Here it is http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/5798347921_38ec2f7f77_b.jpg .  nothing too special but I like the remove viruses for $75... What a deal.For those of you who are curious, this is a legitimate citibank ATM. This is in upper Manhattan if I believe, and it's just there as a temporary replacement as the actual branch burned down a couple months ago. You can read up on it [here](http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2014/01/11/fire-engulfs-citibank-111th-street-injures-7) if you'd like.I was in Africa recently and two of the banks had mobile ATMs. However they looked considerably more trustworthy than those. This has been parked here for months, it's right near Columbia University on Broadway.

Ah, the good ole days of Rollercoaster Tycoon! Apparently some ninjas do leave tracks.This isn't *exactly* what I wanted to read the day before I plan to go to Six Flags. So far I've been told that everyone is okay. Apparently the front train hit a tree that slumped into the path of the roller coaster. [pic](http://i.imgur.com/Agm5Cvn.jpg)

edit: I'm now being told that there are 4 people injured, possibly 2 seriously injured.

[Story](http://ktla.com/2014/07/07/4-injured-on-ninja-roller-coaster-at-magic-mountain-fire-department/)

edit2: Everyone is safely off, they've been told they will receive a full refund but I don't think they're getting front of the line passes for life or anything like that. It doesn't seem like there will be any major lawsuits but I guess that will be up to the individuals.I'm sure there are some lawyers on their way to the park as we speakSo, we know the coaster itself has good safety equipment. It could have been so much worse. http://ktla.com/2014/07/07/4-injured-on-ninja-roller-coaster-at-magic-mountain-fire-department/

Live feed of the rescue effort plus details of the event. It appears 4 people were injured in the event.I was there a with a group of friends today when it happened. We were only 1 seating away from being in that car that derailed. Prior to the next group's seating, we heard a loud bang and saw the vacant cars in front of us jolt forward, slightly, and shortly thereafter we heard what we thought were screams, which we initially thought were normal, considering where we were. Then the ride shut down. We were pretty stunned considering how close we were to being in that car. Totally relieved to know that no one was killed and that it wasn't worse than it could have been. I hope your sister isn't one of the seriously injured ones.I live 10 minutes away from Six Flags and I havent been there in years. Workers are paid shit, management sucks and everyone there obviously hates their jobs. I have an annual pass to disneyland though. The ghost of Colossus is pissed!So uhh anyway we could have a link to a better picture? Cause I can't see shit. That roller coaster is so much fun. Sad that it derailed.Final destination. When I was about 13-14 we went to Disneyland Paris on  a school trip, one kid in our group was absolutely horrified at the thought of going on a ride, but after about a day we convinced him to go on the Indiana jones ride, a good starter ride we thought. He then got stuck upside down for about half an our then wouldn't talk to us again. Cool I'm betting 6 flags is very unhappy that your sister took this picture.[deleted]Worked at that Six Flags (Magic Mountain in Santa Clarita, CA) when I was a sophomore in high school.  Half of the employees there are teens.  Made me never want to ride a rollercoaster in that park again due to safety reason.Damn, been on that ride plenty of times..

Hope everyone is okay Holy shit, I was just there last weekend and I totally thought this would happen while riding the ninja...Wow, I was at this park Last month. Coincidently when I was there, after waiting in line for a long ass time I got in the seat to do Superman backwards. Well about 20 seconds after sitting down they told everyone to get up and get back in line.

Apparently one of the restraints in the seat directly in front of me broke during the previous run.  

I also got threatened with being kicked out of the park because I spoke about what I saw break while waiting in line as they tried to fix it.

Something tells me that park isn't the safest place in the world...At least she's ok, and they're not stuck upside down.

I wish more people would refurbish these old signs over putting up crappy cookie cutter silk screened signs. Do you think the white stripe continued all the way to the base originally? It makes a world of difference, and it looks great!How did you get the sky so blue?I worked in the sign industry for a number of years, built and restored some really cool signs. This is some solid work and the end result is awesome, especially if the neon had to be redone/refurbished. Sometimes I wish I still worked in signs, the pay was absolute shit though. THE GOD DAMN CUP IS WRONG!    ^It's^okay^thoughHey putting Oakdale on the map!  What up AptosThank you - and the owner! - for restoring this sign.

Everything today seems to be a cheaply printed vinyl sign that's lit from behind.  They look terrible.  I absolutely love old signage like this and am also a big fan of hand-painted signs.This is why I hate sign ordinances.  We don't get any new signs like this because of it.  I would love to see more interesting business signs, but they all need to be no more that 3'x5' with no distracting lights on a pole no more than X"" tall.  I would love to see designers let loose to make amazing signs.  

The sign nazis will show up and complain about visual clutter, but I am not saying these signs should go up in a residential area.  We are talking commercial areas only.I love googie.  I wish that would come back in style.  That is very cool but I will say it bothers me a wee bit that the burger is skewed.[deleted]Why did they change the design of the pictures? And make it two colored at the bottom aswell?[deleted]Go talk to that guy with the clown motel.We have one of these in Modesto, Ca too. Great place to go with the current heat.They really fucked up the milkshake and burger art.Amazing!  It is rare that things that old stay for so long,  and you did a great job repainting it.A lot of people and municipal agencies are interested in razing these old signs.  I think there are merits to the argument, but the remaining from that era should have some historic protections.  You did an outstanding job of revitalizing that sign.  It captures the essence of that era, harks to funky early marketing years.   Great work. Lots of people will appreciate the funky aesthetics.  Hope they paid you handsomely.  Great sign and great work you did. Some of those old signs are singular pieces. Even those old ones that were made in quantity, show their parent's style. Granted some do not utilize space or emphasize their message properly as more modern designed signs, they still reach their audience well. 

I hope the neon can be salvaged or cheaply fixed. We are investigating some LED neon replacements for a sign of ours, but our neon is not bare; it is behind glass. is this oakdale?Nice work!  There's a really nice old neon sign at a donut place where I live, and someone repainted it horribly.  I wish someone with your skill had done it.

Updated shark bite pic.Shark bite, or Marv Albert?Quick rub some tattoo ink into it!Reminds me of Bill Burr on shark attacks:

This guy tried to get me to go scuba diving. I go ""I'm not going, I don't want to get eaten by a shark."" He's like ""well actually, 90% of shark attacks happen in shallow waters."" It's like *no shit*! That's where the people are. It's called the beach. 90% of people are frolicking along the coastline. It's not like there're people swimming to Europe. 'LETS GO TO ICELAND, YA PUSSIES!' http://imgur.com/clhMH23I used to surf at night under a pier in Galveston and watch the fisherman pull up sharks all night. Here's the news story from channel 2 in Houston: http://m.click2houston.com/news/teen-bitten-by-shark-on-galveston-beach/26407572
SHARK BITE HOO HA HA!Notice how the shark took a bite and didn't commit because he realized it isn't something he would like to eat. Sharks don't want to kill and eat humans, it was just an accident. Many years ago, when my wife was still my girlfriend, we visited my cousins in Florida. As a prank I asked my cousin to swim under the water (we were at the beach) and fake bite my wife's leg. He obliged and she freaked out, screaming and thrashing about. She still has a faint scar from it years later and it ends up my cousin never really bit her.It's interesting that you can see the difference in the top row of teeth and the bottom row in her bite mark.As an Australian I feel this belongs in r/awwThats like the best case scenario for a shark bite. Turns into a badass scar and it doesn't even look like it needs to be stitched up
If you listen carefully you can hear Australia laughing. #justsharkythingsA bull shark my old buddy from high school caught in Galveston this summer.

It's safe to say I will never step foot in that water again. Ugh, sharks always use too much teeth. I'm suspicious.

I took a friend on a photography assignment for my local tourism board in Queensland. We travelled 500km (~300 miles) west of our home town in Brisbane past Chinchilla, Condamine and out to Roma. The light pollution is minimal in this part of the world so it's possible to get great milky way and starscapes.

The orange glow at the bottom of the shot is from the moon about to rise, creating colour on the horizon just like the sun would.

Some more of my work:

[Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/andrewtallon) and www.andrewtallon.com

And camera settings info if anyone's interested: Canon 5DmkIII + 16-35mm f/2.8L lens - shot at f/2.8, 15 seconds, ISO10000. Processed in Adobe Lightroom 5.

**Edit:** Getting lots of questions about processing, stacking etc. The photo is a single image edited in Adobe Lightroom 5. The camera pointing towards the backlighting moonrise turned the tree into a silhouette. It should have been shot in RAW but it was late, I was tired and I'd been shooting timelapses all night. Still, shows how well the mkIII jpegs hold up in post.

Here's the edit:

http://i.imgur.com/3aD7QXJ.jpg

I'm a bit confused as to why the original is so green. I had the camera on Auto White Balance and it must have completely stuffed it in the really dark conditions.

**Edit 2:** Also getting the usual questions about what the sky looks like in the photo vs real life. Long exposure technique brings out more stars and a clearer milky way, but after adjusting for a few minutes you can definitely make out the milky way belt as you see it here - just with less individual stars, and less saturation. Our eyes lose most of their colour as they adjust to a dark environment. 
I really want to see the milky way one day. Light Pollution sucks.Everytime I see a picture like this I hate living in a city more and more.So you promised him a good photo, and he's backlit by how many suns?Seeing pictures like this fills me with awe. 

Wonder what's out there. Fisting the space vagina that is the milky way. I was born in Bosnia and lived there during the war in the 90's. I didn't have much, but thanks to the lack of electricity and light at night, I had amazing view of the stars.  Thanks for reminding me of that!Does the sky actually look like this in some places?Ah yes, the North Korean space program. Hhhhhhhyytrewsccfdazxcvbnnnm

Edit: Welp, I meant to comment on how awesome this picture was earlier but when I went out to turn the chicken on the grill my four year apparently grabbed my iPad and had something more important to say. This is so beautiful. Holy fuck our planet is awesome.Be humble, for you are made of earth.
Be noble, for you are made of stars.Light pollution, air pollution, water pollution, all the toxic result of our own demanding, insensitive cultures. What a shame we can't enjoy the eden this earth once was.See, what blows my fucking mind about this photo is that if you glance at it and recognize the Milky Way, you might say ""Wow, that's a lot of stars there"" but if you look for a little longer you realize there is literally a CLOUD OF FUCKING STARS there. Holy shit. A. CLOUD. OF. STARS.

And that's one galaxy. Ours. There are billions of galaxies out there.

And.... my brain is melting. Took a sec to find your friend. Totally looks like he's part of the tree. Sick pic.Makes me wish I was in the middle of nowhere sometimes. Just me alone and this. Nothing else.

Goddamn kids putting pennies on the track! *shakes fist*Bad news about Switzerland? :(

Gopferdammi wo ish das?Well, if I had to be stranded anywhere it would probably be Switzerland.Your train experienced what is known as a mainline derailment, which are very rare, particularly for passenger trains. In general, such derailment are caused when one of three things happens:

1) Rail breaks, often due to weather. Cold weather can break or weaken a rail so it breaks later. This is one of the reasons that passenger trains experience mainline derailments much less often than freight - they are lighter and thus cause less damage to the track. 

2) Train handling. Trains are not like cars, you can't ""drive"" them the same way. The engineer must be aware of the speed, the track dynamics (curvature, hills, etc), and where the train is in relation to this. This tends to be more applicable to freight, where the trains are longer, however, overspeed has been the cause of two major derailment recently (Spain and New York's passenger rails). 

3) Some unknown mechanical issue. Perhaps a wheel broke (yes, it happens). Perhaps something cracked. Perhaps... Well, there's lots of things that could happen, but they are rare... Very rare.

4) Outside factors... Such as a landslide... Can do the same things. 

In this case, I'm surprised that the track underneath the landslide didn't break... Which would have let everyone know that there was trouble there. hooooly fuck. I was in Switzerland this past fall and took the cog-wheel rail up mount Pilatus. If that had happened to me I would have shit myself. Glad you're ok!There is a redditor everywhere.Here is the story if anyone wants more details. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28775998At least the injured will be treated by some of the best health care in the world. If this were Amtrak, they'd be ****ed. It was probably the pro Russian rebels.At least it happened in Switzerland... That's a big plus!

I'll see myself out.Maybe you should get to the other side...In Switzerland even crash sites are scenic.Good thing this happened in a nice safe country like Switzerland. If this had happened elsewheres you could of been in big trouble.It kind of looks like the train cars from the Harry Potter movies.

We cannot ever repay them.70 years later, D-Day vet Jim 'Pee Wee' Martin jumps again http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/05/world/europe/d-day-paratrooper-jumps-again/I am impressed. He has more moxzy than some men 1/4 his age Is there a video of the jump. I kinda wanted to see it.I was once at a remembrance day ceremony in Ottawa. One of my friends had just completed jump school and was all full of piss and vinegar. He saw a vet with jump wings on and immediately accosts him ""Oh hey you have jump wings two, I have jump wings I've done 18 (or whatever number) of jumps how many did you do?"" The vet just looks at him and says ""2"", my buddy undeterred ""Oh cool, mine have been all training jumps, or exercise the exercise one were cool, you know with all the gunfire and stuff. Yours training jumps?"" The vet says ""Yup, one was"" and paused my buddy waited and just before he was about to spout off again the vet continued ""and the other was into Normandy."" My friend screwed his mouth shut very fast and was so embarrassed that he was about to berate this man for only having two jumps that he started crying. The vet was super cool about it, took his wings off and pinned them on my buddy and said ""I won't get much more use out of these anymore, they're all yours"". My friend learned humility that day, and it stuck. I'm not even sure gravity brought him back to Earth as much as his cannonball sized testicles just anchoring back towards land.

He's a seriously brave and strong person.Airborne!This man is a true American hero. I'd love to take him out for a beer, if that's ever be a possibility.I like to imagine he landed like Iron Man does. Fist and one knee touching the ground, him looking down then slowly looking up as he prepares to destroy Nazis.CURAHEEEEEE!Air-fucking-borne!!!This man, and not some gansta rapper or slutty crack hoe should be the role model kids these days should look up to. What an unbeliveably brave man. 

Thank you for everything Jim!The expression in his eyes tells a lifetime of stories.  Rip roaring adventures, tender love stories, regrets, the first time he held his son.....it's all there.PeeWee! I've had the pleasure of meeting this man and his wife at a reunion with my dad. He is truly amazing. Some context about him: http://www.battleatbest.com/james-martin.html

So he was in the legendary 101st airborne/506 PIR that was portrayed in the series Band of Brothers.

But not all of us live in the middle of the trash, thoughThis picture isn't very accurate...that stadium is actually finished.  Watch City of God.This kind of thought drives me nuts. On one hand I can't wait for the WC to get here, and on the other, Brazil should very obviously be spending its money elsewhere.I am Brazilian and live in Brazil. Posts like these, and like that other one from the other day with some guy with his sign protesting against the World Cup, can be misleading. Yes, Brazil is a third world country, we don't have good public health, education, and such. But, the thing is, the World Cup budget is equivalent to only one month of education spending ([according to the biggest newspaper here](http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.folha.uol.com.br%2Ffsp%2Fpoder%2F167243-custo-da-copa-equivale-a-um-mes-de-gastos-com-educacao.shtml&sandbox=1)), it's not money that would solve every problem here.

Yes, it's big money being spent on things that are not priorities, but no one is dying here *because* of the World Cup. I just want everyone to be aware of that. The one and only guilty here is the government. I completely disagree with protests against FIFA, the World Cup, etc. Heck, there are people vandalizing the bus carrying the Brazilian team. They have nothing to do with Brazil's problems, they are just doing their job and trying to bring some joy to people, even to boys like the one in this image.

Actually, in my opinion, if people don't like the idea of hosting a World Cup here, they should have protested when Brazil launched its candidature. Not now, when there's no going back - the World Cup is happening. Why they didn't? I don't know. This is kind of controversial but I don't think people are not protesting ""sincerely"". I think they are protesting just to show their ""big brothers"" (read: you, the other nations) that we care about politics and are engaged in trying to change something, which is, unfortunately, not true.

What we should do now, is host a great World Cup. Let's treat well our tourists, not scare them.

Edit: clarified that I am Brazilian, not just live here.Way to be a slacktavist and ""care"" after it's too late. Oh fuck this is deep.

Edit: used the wrong word. Guess I meant this is emotional or sad, didn't mean deep. Also I was asleep hence I didn't reply to any comments. This is not a photo.Mirror?So, help us by coming here, making business with us, not shaming us. Slums are a century old problem and jobs can make people to get out of there. Those stadiums were built with brazilian hands, using brazilian money, making our economy to generate wealth, creating infra-structure to bring tourists to our continental country, that is not just the Amazon and Rio. 

Brazil is the only BRIC that managed to reduce wealth inequality in this century, also the only one that has a minimum income program, that is only paid if families put their kids in school, give vaccines, currently it covers 25% of brazilian population.  

Is that enough? Of course not. It is just a beginning. Brazil came out of three decades of economic stagnation and political instability (the 70s, 80s and first half of the 90s). Just ten years ago, we were still borrowing billions from IMF, now we are lenders to the IMF. We are changing, and I hope that will keep it up. Even if Brazil is prosperous, it will take a generation to get hid of poverty.

You guys might say that sports is Bread and Circus, but our greatest hero came out of the most elitist sport in the world, Ayrton Senna, he's our role model. Most of our football sport legends came out of poverty, and they are celebrated because talent is blind to class or color/race. It unite us.
The World Cup in brazil has been announced 7 years ago, Reddit activists only started caring 20 days before the actual event. Very powerful scene. I wonder if that child feels proud or insignificant? Probably just hungry.""There is inequality in that country so we shouldn't be hosting anything there.""

Guess we'll just be hosting everything in Iceland from now on.There were bunch of protests saying ""FUCK FIFA"" and starving kids with a football on the plate all around where the games were being held. Brazil! Ponytail!Not all of Brazil is slums just sayingYou could make a picture like that for any of the places the world cup was held in.Mirror? Link does not work for meI'm Brazilian, I love my country but I've always believed the World Cup was a huge mistake.
I understand that many say that the expenditure with the World Cup's events wouldn't even cover a month of health and education budget. That's true. 
What offends me (and should offend all Brazilians) is that our government simply does whatever crap FIFA wants. Summing up our greedy politicians (it doesn't matter if they claim to be liberals, conservatives, socialists or capitalists), this was expected to be a failure from the beginning.
There was no need to build stadiums outside  the Southeastern region. This World Cup is basically a way ex-President Lula found to maintain his party in the power for a long time. One final remark: it would've been the same if Serra or Alkmin had won.

I'm just glad my fellow Brazilians started growing critical thought.Nice work /r/pics mods - pic and choose what non pictures you'll allow based on how many upvotes they getAnother brazilian here. Definitely mad at government.  
We are mad because our education is poor. Not only public education in Brazil is a joke, but a teacher's salary is also a joke.  
I used to teach english in private schools, and my salary was a little bit more than 1 and a half minimum wage, working 40 hours a week. It was around 600 dollars/month. While a politician's wage is something around 12,000 dollars/month, plus benefits, such as assistance to buy clothes. because 12,000 dollars a month is not enough to buy clothes, they obviously need some kind of aid to it. And let's not talk about stealing money, because I believe 90% of the politicians or more are corrupt.  
This world cup was one of the biggest robbery in the history of Brazil.  
In China, they spent around one billion dollars to build a stadium from the ground. They had nothing, and they built 100% of the stadium.  
Here in Brazil, they spent R$1,1 billion (something around 600 million dollars) in the Maracana (brazilian's biggest stadium - Rio de Janeiro) to repair, fix and adapt it to FIFA's requirements.  They build stadiums such as Arena da Amazônia (http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_da_Amaz%C3%B4nia) where the soccer competitions is ridiculous. There are A LOT of stadiums throughout Brazil, specially on the southeast and south. There's NO reason to build another stadiums that far north. The only reason is that it's easier to steal money building things.  
And Brazil has a monstrous list of politicians stealing money like crazy. And our president ""never knows anything"". Things as ""I'm not aware of..."" are sad everyday words.  And these are only the beginning of the problems. There are sooo much more.  
That is why I can't say: ""No, I'm not proud of being a brazilian, and I'm sure as hell I'm not proud of hosting a World Cup here. We don't need it. Though it's too late now.""Ok, can someone explain this to me.

 Why are people so upset about this? Yes, that money should be used for helping the infrastructure of Brazil and the people in it. But wouldn't them investing a lot of money only bring more money to them. Even tho many works have died for this cause. It's brought more jobs for the people. Is the Brazilian government super corrupt or somethin and are most likely going to pocket the large profits?

It's in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere, but it isn't far out of the way if you're traveling by car between Agra and Jaipur.  It costs virtually nothing.  You just need to tip the guy who takes you around and tells you about the site (who is well worth it) and another guy who sits at a table at the front.  You can't go into the well, but the views down are breathtaking.

On the downside, don't expect a lot when you get there.  There's almost no informational signage, and the guide knows as much about the history as you could learn in an afternoon.  India generally does a shitty job of looking after its antiquities and presenting them to visitors.  (They're working on improving that, but this site must be low on the list.)  I really hope the producers of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" made a generous donation towards the preservation of this site and Indian antiquities in general!

If you go, make sure you stop by the Hindu temple next door, which is in current use.

A short film about the guy in the pic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S20Zi7tsIA (thanks /u/daftmatrix)

A quote from the guy's Facebook post:


""I decided to stand here with a message everyday, after I attended a world religion conference. Every speaker there spoke so beautifully, but I felt that such a small number of people were getting to hear what was being said. The idea came to me when I wasn't allowed to stand in line to receive blessings at a church. I was also given looks when I went to pray at a mosque. I saw that some Hindu temples say 'Hindus only' and the Parsi fire temple at Churchgate doesn't allow non-parsis. That's when I realized that we all just make big talk, but when it comes to humanity we all shut our doors to others, in the name of religion. I've been doing this for 6 years to bring that humanity back. People have even complained about me doing this, but at the end of the day I'm still here and close to 3 lakh people have waved and smiled back at me since I started, including those who complained. That, in my eyes, is a victory of humanity over the devils that live inside each of us.""There is a guy in Chicago who holds up a sign every day that reads ""The FBI murdered my wife"".serious question: how does he make a living?

I guess you can say hes been holding up his sign religiouslyHow the hell do they keep their whites so clean? What fucking detergent is this? He must have the strongest triceps by nowI passed this man everyday for almost an year on my way to school. Everyday, same spot, same smile, same energy. Fucking awesome dude. I'll be back in Mumbai in a few days so if I see him again, I'll show him this thread. 

But what if your religion doesn't say anything about loving everybody?He's like the Indian [Jackie Moon](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyqip94klg1qgfn58o1_500.png)I lived in India for a year and without a doubt, for me it was the one place I've been in the world where everyone has accepted everyone else's choice of religion or spirituality without question. No one ever attacked me or people I knew no matter how different all our views were.We got one rule and one rule only. Everybody Love Everybody We should all pitch in and buy him a post.Clearly a heathen extremist. He's a danger to himself and others. ""ps. my arms hurt""How's that working out for him?I think taping it to the post would have been more efficient...
His delts must be huge. Reddit, I confess myself disappointed. This man has been holding up a sign written on a white poster **for three years** and there have been zero (0) photoshops. 

Like, WTF?What a great dude. Thanks for posting!Seems like /r/Atheism's Anti-Christ I'm an atheist... should i do nothing?Must be nice to not have a jobThats an amazing thing to see. Unfortunately even many in the first world don't think the same (I'm personally a Christian) and one of the goals of the Church is to let everyone in, and allow everyone to follow if they so desire, however certain churches like the West Borough Baptist Church and a few others spread hate in the name of the lord, which is the opposite message of the bible. To end this I will add Christs commandment. ""So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other."" - John 13:34i like his shoesSo here is a question what the hell do these people do for money.

So my parents have a farm with lots of animals. They have some exotic ones as well, but they do animal therapy for special needs kids. Anyways, we had just had a batch of baby emus hatch. Couple weeks later I was watching Jurassic Park 3 while parents were gone. Big thunderstorm comes in and the emu babies were outside. So I rig up a little pen and bring them in the house in the next room and shut the door. Continue watching the movie an forget all about the birds. As I'm at the scene with the little ""copies"" as they're called in the movie (actually a Compsognathus) I hear a chirping noise. Pause the movie and hear it again. The noise I was hearing was earily similar to the noise of those little ""copies."" At first I thought my ears were playing tricks on me, somehow echoing the noises from the movie. Hear it again and like the stereotypical white person would, follow the sound. Leads me to the next room. Now before I continue, I'd like to preface what follows that normally I'm not a pussy but the circumstances were acceptable for my reaction. Story continued: I open the door, and the sound stops. I enter the room and the the baby emus, which not only sound similar but look the same when they're all charging at you while you were in the midst of watching a diasaur movie. As the mass heard of killer baby emus charge at me, I freak out, they chase me out of the room and I lock myself the next room. Turns out the thunder spooked them and they were just running around scared. After I collected myself and realized they weren't blood thirsty mini-raptors and that I was being I giant baby, I spent the next 2 hours hunting and chasing baby emus. 

TL;DR - had bay emus in house while watching Jurassic park 3, emus get out scare me and I run like a little bitch. Spend 2 hours herding/corralling baby emus in my house.Reminds me of a baby tapir: http://www.zooborns.com/.a/6a010535647bf3970b0147e2a8bd5c970b-500wi

(Sorry for the non-link, I'm on mobile and rely too heavily on RES to remember how to create a link manually.)When I was younger, I was terrified of Emus.  I don't even live in Australia, but every time we ate at Outback, there'd be those damn creepy pictures of Emus in Bowties on EVERY WALL.  I spent an hour staring at my lap.

I can't find them online, but imagine Andy Warhol colors mixed with those BIG, YELLOW EYES and clown-like attire.

I went to a local zoo a few years ago and went up to this emu enclosure where two adults approached me at the fence. Their faces were unmistakably raptor or theropod faces with beaks rather than toothed jaws. 
I met eyes with one and he growled deeply at me. It was one of the most terrifying animal noises I've ever experienced and the creature is smaller than me.

But THIS is something new.This should be a standard feature in vehicles involved in accidents.

If you hit someone, your license plate should fall off like a lizard's tail. My brother and I were driving down the interstate at about 1:00 AM when we saw a car on the side of the road.  Just as we came up on it, it pulled onto the interstate.  My brother saw it soon enough to switch lanes and avoid hitting it; however, neither of us saw the car in front of it (also on the side of the road) that decided to pull out and do a full U-turn on the interstate.  We t-boned his driver side door, slid through the median, and came to a stop in the opposite lanes, taking out a ""No U-turns"" sign along the way.  As soon as we came to a stop, the driver of the vehicle jumps out the passenger-side door, runs and gets in the other car, and it drives off.  In his hurry, he left his cell phone behind in the car.  My brother was sitting in the police car while the cop called this 19 year old kid's parents on his cell phone at 1:00 AM.

TL;DR: (Probable) drunk kid caused a hit and run, left his phone behind, and cops called his parents.A drunk teenager slammed into my family's van and up into the yard. The car stopped about 3 feet from my mother's window and about 6 feet from her face, judging by the tire marks in the yard. The van that got slammed quite possibly saved her life. But the van didn't stop there! The license plate got lodged onto the side of the van, and the cops had quite the fun with it. 

My mother went with the cops to the address of the plates the next morning. They confronted them by saying my mother was pressing charges for the hit and run. The parents with the son denied and denied and claimed the car was at the shop. They screamed and yelled indignantly about the ridiculous way the cops were just taking my mom's word for it and you can't just blame people for your own drunken driving and made up vehicle descriptions (of the car that ""wasn't there"").

This went on for 10 or so minutes. Then they pulled out the smashed license plate. :) I can only imagine the satisfaction.

Edit:words

Something similar happened when my dad got rear ended about 10 years ago, except his car was so dirty it left the letters legible enough that they could find the guy based on the description of his car. I've seen a similar incident except it just got more humorous.


I monitor the security system for my apartment building. This one day we noticed the carpark sliding gate (made of steel) was bent horrifically out of shape. Upon reviewing footage from the night before, I discovered a black SUV trying to get out of the carpark.

The driver slowly crept towards the gate, would reverse then slowly creep forwards again. This continued a number of times, each time getting a little bit closer to the gate. Eventually the car touched the gate and the driver started to slowly push the gate out of shape. Then realising that didn't work they reversed back and started ramming the gate.


By this stage a couple of people had gathered out the front bemused as to what was happening. A few people actually tried to pull the gate open but it was so disfigured it wouldn't move.  After further ramming, the number plate of the car fell off the front.  Thats when the police turned up and when the driver got out of the car. The driver was a drunk woman on crutches. She hobbled over to the number plate and tried to pick it up to hide it.  The police just stood there in amusement and then arrested her when she tried to hobble drunkly back to her car.


She didn't exactly have a leg to stand on in defense.I have had this happen to me twice with no such luck. I have a justice boner right now.  I would have loved to have been there at the exact moment the guy realized his License Plate was gone.I would press the shit out of those charges.Justice served on a plate.In my state this would not happen:  no front-end license plate.  I suppose you could back into someone.Cop here. You'd be amazed how many people leave their personal info at a crime scene...

My personal favorite was a burglar who left his drivers license on the victims front porch. [deleted]I thought you meant puke. That yellow stuff on the bottom is pretty convincing. My friend and I were involved in a hot in run. The cop ran the plates. Didn't match the car that hit us and they did nothing about it. Well damnCar was probably stolen, so I doubt you'll get your vengeance.  Sorry.Watch this be the license plate: http://i.imgur.com/5NMFFe9.jpg

Motherfucker.I work in insurance. Make sure their claims adjuster gets that like asap. 

Edit: and that photo is evidence too, so make sure the claims adjuster gets that photo too in order to place that driver at the scene. Some jackasses try to play like they weren't even there. Great! If we analyze the paint chips we could find out what kind of car it was![I tried my best. ""284-?B7""?](http://imgur.com/OjjUclk) 

EDIT: Oh christ I just realized that was his license plate. Brain no function in AM. A guy from my hometown got drunk at a bar and decided to drive home.  Instead of reversing out of his parking spot, he went forward and hit the front entrance of the bar. He took off and left his entire front bumper, license plate included, on the front step. These never get old.i see these often enough to never try and and get away with.

not that i would anyway. its an asshole move.I always forget that there are license plate numbers on the front bumpers on cars.Many times I thought, ""How did they hit you like that with the back of their car?""

There's a reason all the open land you see surrounding cities always seems to have a few head of cattle grazing on it, and it's not because the owners of the land have any ownership in the cattle themselves.*little*Make sure y'all take advantage of the tax breaks you can get for agricultural animalsWhen I was a freshman in high school I was enrolled in the school's Ag class as my science class for the year. For extra credit, we could raise a project pig for slaughter. My parents agreed, split the costs (divorced) and I took care of it every week through till spring.

During this time, I would make frequent trips down to the pens after school hours and on weekends/holidays to clean the pen and feed my pig. I decided to name him Oscar, because my bologna had a fucking first name. At the time, my little sister was about 4 or 5. She's always loved animals. I knew that this could be potentially rough on her, so I made it very clear every time we would go visit Oscar, that Oscar's job in life was to become food for us. She didn't LIKE the situation, but she understood and respected the purpose.

Spring came, and brought the butcher. All the little (fucking huge) piggies went into a truck, and came back in grocery bags. We filled both my parents fridges and freezers. That weekend, we had an amazing Egg, ham, sausage, and bacon breakfast. About mid way through, I prodded my little sister, who had been told that Oscar had been turned into food, and informed her that this was in fact Oscar, and his job was done.

She was mid bite of sausage when I said this. She stopped chewing, and just kind of stared at me for a couple seconds with big eyes. She slowly dropped her gaze down to her plate full of Oscar, and then back up to me. I thought to myself ""Fuck, here comes the crying and life trama."" She started chewing again, swallowed, had a big grin and proclaimed ""Oscar tastes GOOOOOOOD!"" and stuff another chunk of sausage in her mouth.

Edit: Fixed some paragraph formatting. Side note: My sister will be 18 in December now, and still remembers how fucking delicious Oscar tasted. She still loves animals.My wife, when growing up, owned a cow. The cow stayed on her grandparents farm. She loved this cow, and she named it nibbles, for the way it grazed on the grass. One day her grandparents sold the cow to a meat plant, and well nibbles was nibbled. This and another incident, is why my wife does not name pets anymore. /r/onoff
http://i.imgur.com/JPEJeAH.gifThat's like 1/8 cow. Wish I could just get that much from my sister (they farm cattle) but they only deal in quarters. So. Much. Meat. What's the dollar value of that meat?I've herd that renting out to cows can be a huge misteak.We did the same thing with our farm land. We rented it to a farmer and got paid half in beef and half in money.I got slightly concerned when I read ""I put an ad on Craigslist for my parents"" That's a Win-Win-Lose opportunity!My Grandparents don't understand that frozen meat will dry out and go bad and that you probably shouldn't eat Parmesan cheese that expired 8 years ago.

They're still here on Earth alive, thankfully, so I keep my mouth shut at Thanksgiving.My roommate hunts and every summer she comes home and fills the freezer with Deer, Moose and Elk. It's glorious. You have an awesome deal going there. There's nothing like fresh locally raised (or wild) meat in the freezer. Now you should put out an ad offering the meat in exchange for land and take the whole thing full circle. ""Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!""That's a mooving picture.

The futuristic bodywork was designed by Marcello Gandini, head designer at Bertone, and featured a 1.6 L Lancia Fulvia V4 engine. 

The Lancia Stratos HF Zero stayed for a long time in Bertone's museum, and in 2011 was sold out during an auction in Italy for 761.600. It was recently on display in the exhibit ""Sculpture in Motion: Masterpieces of Italian Design"" at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. It is currently on display at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, GA at the Dream Cars exhibit unit September 2014.

The body was wedge-shaped, finished in distinctive orange and was an unusually short (3.58 m (141 in)) length and only 84 cm (33 in) tall, and shared little with the production version. The Zero appeared in Michael Jackson's 1988 film, Moonwalker.

Couple things about this photo:

The fish probably loves his home. It's spacious and has a narrow opening. That being said, pollution is terrible for many reasons. :( Please do not throw litter in our oceans! The [Giant Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch) is a disturbingly real threat to our oceans. 

Based off of the location of the photograph ( Japan ) and what I can see of the eyes my best guess for the species of fish is *Pseudochromis fuscus,* commonly known as a yellow dottyback. ( It could potentially be from the Serrinadae family, but without a good view of the dorsal spines I can't tell. ) It is fairly common in the home aquarium, but can be quite aggressive and protective of it's territory. Note in the picture how his fins and gills are flared out. The diver is viewed as a threat, and the fish is displaying itself to try and scare off the diver. 

TLDR; he likes his can and doesn't want the diver to take it.

The can hasn't been submerged for long. A few months at most. The life found on the top of the can develops quickly. The red patches you can see on the can are a calcium based algae known as [Coralline Algae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coralline_algae) and the small white spirals are a small species of [Polychaete tube worms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychaete) ( *Sabellidae* ) The small bud of coral on the tab of the can appears to be closely related to [*Seriatopora hystrix*,](http://coral.aims.gov.au/factsheet.jsp?speciesCode=0342) commonly referred to as bird's nest coral. It's lack of color is likely due to water pollution. If you look closely you can see the individual polyps of the colony, indicating it is alive despite it's bleached colors. A struggling coral growing on the tab of a soda can [makes me feel like this](http://i.imgur.com/D9dQr.gif).

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/LLyhy9v.jpg) is a picture taken in my nano reef showing what the coral might look like if it were happier.

I have supplied identification with my limited knowledge of Japanese marine ecosystems. If I am incorrect please feel free to enlighten me!Photo credit: Brian Skerry.  More here: http://www.brianskerry.com/portfolio/japans-ocean-wilderness/ ^((site probably can't handle reddit's group hug)^)Reminds me of the fish in Finding Nemo that was in Fish-Friendly Sharks meetingI just don't see this new flavour of soda really working.That's really an amazing pic, ecologically speaking.  Try finding all the different forms of aquatic life on the top of that can.  Fascinating.
As a diver, i see so much trash in the ocean.  Some people try to see the silver lining in stuff like this, in the way aquatic animals can turn discarded human trash into homes.  Personally, I would rather just see us stop polluting and stop the warming and acidification of the oceans.  maybe stop/reverse damage to coral reefs.  Also, everytime you see someone throw a cigarette butt on the street, slap them.  I've seen many many cigarette butts in the ocean.  A co-worker just got a fine of $500 for throwing one from his car.  I almost did jumping jacks of joy.What is that, a yellow dottyback?After that bobbit worm post looking at fish makes my skin crawl just thinking about it...Soda pressing. Hello, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savoir Poseidon?uhhh... hello.

I love the little things growing on the can as well...ugh I'm just imagining how it feels to cut my fingers on the edge of those thingsOne mans garbage is another fishes mansion.Aquarium hobbiest here.

I am sick and tired of the older generation scolding the younger generation on our culture. Everything that they don't like, everything that is different, is a sign of the coming of the end-times.

I find it very bothersome that video games are the cause of violent behavior but Law & Order and C.S.I. are just fine. I think it's disgusting that parents look down on their children for not being able to afford a house and car and kids at 25 when the economy is *so much worse* than it was a few decades ago. 

I will make sure to remember this when I am old because their behavior is disgraceful.I think this makes a really good point in that phones are not necessarily disconnecting us from the world, but actually connecting us more.We've got instagram filters for that black and white effect now.There is nothing new under the sun.I'm sure people were moaning just as much about how these new-fangled newspapers were preventing people from talking each other and how much better it was in the good old days.This is in public, I think when people say this they are talking about one on one interactions where people are just sitting on their phones. The main difference is that a newspaper runs out at some point, people get bored with it, it is a finite source of information for the day.

The phone on the other hand lasts as long as it's charged, you have an infinite amount of distraction at your fingertips.

I understand the point you make, people get consumed in thing and can be anti-social, however a cell phone is not equal to a newspaper in this regard.

Also, children never really read newspapers, and they consume themselves in phones.My grandmother would complain that no one writes letters anymore. She emphasized the importance of sitting down and actually planning what you were gonna say, instead of picking up the phone and just winging it. Now my father complains that no one calls anymore, they just write each other textsWhenever I visit my dad he gets on me about being on my phone. Usually I'm reading a Reddit article, a news article, or a Reddit comment chain. But mostly informative shit. 

One day I finally got annoyed and told him ""if I were sitting here reading a book or a newspaper you'd have no problem with it. You can do a lot more with a phone than selfies and texting."" Then I show him the article. 

He hasn't been as forthcoming about my face in phone antics. its not the fucking same at all, a phone has endless content while a news paper or magazine is limited and i'm pretty sure people didn't carry that shit around all day and check it every 30 min like a cell phone that can fit in your pocket All those white people turned into Asians.It's not the same, you finish the newspaper. Letting the days go by....Performing a study on l this phenomena would be interestingMake more posts like this!Time isn't holding up... Time isn't after us...It's not really the same simply because people don't generally walk and do other tasks while reading the newspaper, whereas with phones/texting it's more common, and potentially more dangerous.Turn around; nothing to read in here other than twenty-somethings justifying shitty social practices.I'm much more concerned by the general anxiety and distrust of others that people are starting to develop. 

I was knocking on doors talking to people about a recycling initiative. I had people chase me (they'd run. I stopped and asked what was wrong) to tell me they were calling the police on me.

The idea of someone knocking on your door in the middle of the day to give them some info about recycling and some pamphlets was so threatening to people... thinking I'm going to rob them. 

The older people were so much nicer and trusting. They'd welcome me into their homes, ask me to sit down and talk to them about it. I gotta be honest this shit is beyond inaccurate. You never saw people in class in the fucking 50's whipping out a newspaper and reading it. You never went to a movie theater and saw people reading the paper. You never went to dinner with your family and people sat there and read the paper instead of talking. Reality is, reading a newspaper back then did not make them anti-social. It also was one of the few ways to receive the news unlike cellphones which are used for much more than the news. Anyone that believes the two are comparable are extremely delusional.

Saving houses is a top priority.  A fire map may show that a fire has burnt for miles but once it gets close to a house rev they concentrate everything so houses rarely burn and if they do it's almost always borders open space.  So,  a If you live in the interior of a housing development and such a fire hits, it's super unlikely that your house will burn

**EDIT** When I write ""top priority"" I just mean that they care more about them then open space or perhaps industry but surely not over lives including risking firefighters to save homes but they will, from what I've seen, drop more water etc near a housing development if it looks like the development is in danger.[Some techniques firemen use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wypQc57kacg). I didn't know about this until there were some outbreak of fires a couple years ago in Austin/Texas. another view, http://i.imgur.com/OgaXn6T.jpg you can see the house just below ours here didnt make it. Sad part is that a the family who owned it just bought it 1 month ago and moved in 1 week ago. They are out of the country and Im not sure if they are even aware. They still wont let us into the area, these pictures were taken from quite a distance. I'm glad your family is safe. On a side note. Your parents are fucking rich.Firefighters are pretty much the best people.  I grew up in southern California, where shit was on fire damn near all the time.  Those guys put their lives on the line to protect other people's houses.  Pretty hard to name somebody more worthy of respect.That's awesome. Hope the landslide season is just as lucky. That's always the worst.The work that the firefighters did in San Diego this past week is incredible. With only one known casualty and a minimum number of buildings burned down, they really did an amazing job at containing these wildfires. All in the middle of a heat wave, too!Wish I could place this comment more towards the top of the page so, if someone could bump me up I would appreciate it.

PEOPLE CONSIDER VOLUNTEERING! If you happen to live in an area with a VFD or other volunteer emergency services.

I am a now retired volunteer fire fighter.  I basically retired because there were not people for a one fire truck station.  It wasn't even a big Class A truck that can hold four to six men.  This is a type B that can fight structure fires but, mostly set up for brush fires.

Only three people were needed to go on calls and often just two would do.  When I retired there was a family man, often out of town, and myself.  It reached the point where he couldn't respond for most calls or come to training; which was also rare.

All emergencies in my little district have to covered by paid firemen and other county volunteer units around the county.  It can take 20 minutes in even good weather for the paid guys to respond.

I don't know if the people in the area even know that most of the county department is volunteer.

If you live in a rural area, small town, there is a chance that your local fire department is volunteer or a mixture.

It isn't for everybody.  It is dangerous, calls come at the worst hours and usually in the worst weather, and can take up a lot of time especially your first year for training.
But it is a job that makes a difference and most of the people on the departments are great and interesting people.Fellow evacuee here (Colorado). Flames came within 50 feet of my apartment building and was saved by firefighters during the Waldo Canyon Fire two years ago. Glad to see you and your family are safe. Scary stuff.Throw a BBQ for them, boy that'd be awesome. Just went out surveying the damage from the fire that evacuated my office today.  Seriously in shock at how close the fire got to many homes and businesses, without actually damaging the buildings.  San Diego Fire Department had their hands full, and pulled off some amazing miracles this week.Defensible space also kicks ass...definitely worth the extra effort. Yes we do (I did before retiring).  The coolest thing I got assigned to do was at a fire in Florida, I was a spotter in a helicopter.  It was a Bell Cobra that was converted to haul cameras or a bambi bucket.I'm picturing a last stand ww2 style with firefighters yelling stuff like ""WE CANT HOLD ANY LONGER"" and ""GOD DAMN IT, HOLD THE LINE MEN"" and for some reason I imagine them crouching behind sandbags and occasionally firing hoses over like machine guns.

I'm gonna need someone to turn this into a movie or at least a drawing /u/awildsketchappearedPlease post this to /r/firefightingNow's the time to expand their property as values are at an all time low. 
Your house has defensible space. i.e. The brush does not come up all the way to the house.  Without defensible space the firefighters can not risk trying to save the house.  The number one thing you can do to protect a house in a fire prone area is to keep atleast 100 feet of grass only around the house.  In forests this is very important.  

(Degree in rangeland ecology with a background in prescribed fire)Op is tricking us. http://i.imgur.com/eWZqUXZ.jpgUnfortunately, California is too STUPID to build some fire breaks. It's like people living on the flood plain and then calling it an unexpected disaster. I no longer feel sorry for Californians. Their state burns down from fire every single goddamn year.

California is the greatest display of American idiocy I've ever known. Absolutely brain dead policies that KILL people, and destroy property every year. Every god damn, year.here is 1 more: http://i.imgur.com/DkLjQX4.jpg   give you some more perspective. Your parents were smart to not plant trees too close to the house.

Porco Rosso hideout
 I was there last year. The gap that you swim through is pretty tight at high tide and a bit of swell.

There was tour group that showed up that was full of amateur snorkelers with flotation devices.
Some of the folks were having trouble getting through the gap as you had to swim underwater for 5-10 feet to get to where you could safely resurface without getting checked in the head by rocks. The swell made it easy to get into the beach, but coming out was a a bit more tedious.

We hung out on the beach for a bit as the group trickled out. But there was one girl having a nervous breakdown about going back out through the gap, like visible tormented and crying that she couldn't do it. Turns out, she could barely swim without the life jacket. There were guides from the group to help get her out, so  I have to assume the must have eventually talked her out , because the only other way out would be a helicopter lift.

I thought i was going to have a bit of solitude but she was making a terrible scene, I swam out because she was blowing it.

When you have a bunch of butterflies all gathered like that, some will invariably be sitting with their wings closed. Notice that all these are posing towards the photographer, even the ones in the distance...Also, if you could zoom in, I bet you'll find many of the specimens are missing abdomens. Morphos are notorious for having a weak connection between thorax and abdomen. I've seen many museum specimens lacking butts. Old school solution was to shove a horse hair in the body to hold everything in place (from front to back you pervs). Also, why would they gather like that? That is not normal butterfly behavior, Monarch hibernation behavior notwithstanding.

Anyone know if Jay180 is wrong?

If he's anything like my grandfather he's also wearing wool pants, dark socks, and leather shoes.Congrats to your grandpa on his 95th birthday! Plummeting to earth at 120 mph.

Your Grandfather is the bee's knees.A badass He is livin' like Larry.I used to have that exact watch, its a [Timex Expedition Indiglo](http://www.mcbroom.biz/PMWF/BFTR/Timex-Expedition-Indiglo-AnaDigi-THH-03L.jpg) and I remember getting it in my stocking one christmas when I was about 13 and thinking it was so cool and was like James Bonds watch (which was what I always wanted). Probably what sparked my love of watches. 

Cool picture too. I genuinely want to know what type of watch he's wearingIdk if this guy does or doesnt feel this, but it would be a great honor and memory to be an instructor and have a WWII veteran dive tandem with me.

So sad to have men of this manliness leave us. I wish we could learn from them.95 and still has balls of steel.  

Awesome!

Your grandfather's a bad mother fucker and i'd like to shake his hand Who's the old guy he's strapped to?The fact he is in a button down shirt makes me love this more, I can picture my daddad doing the same :)I love how the jackass instructor has to do something stupid with his hands.Presumably he always wondered what dive bombing felt like *without* the plane... now he knows!

They are literally the opposite of this.  It is very frustrating. When I started running cable and putting together these racks I always did them this way because I was trained to make it all fit together for easy access. Every cable was labeled twice with a marker and a label and Velcroed in neat bundles systematically arranged to make diagnosis as easy as possible in the future. The satisfaction after days of work on something like this was so immense I'd brag about it to friends and show them pictures like I had created a work of art. Sometimes I kinda think it is in a way almost like a kind of installation work of art.

Then I went to a different school district to sort out their server room that was randomly upgraded by multiple contractors. cat 5 tangles like spaghetti in every hue imaginable bound with odd bits of zip ties, velcro, and even twist ties usually discarded from other cables that came with the hardware.  This awesome arrangement won't last terribly long once the network begins to age and lag behind the others. Lopsided upgrades and fickle customer moods towards their contractors will probably see to that. But for now all is right with the world for those few glorious years where pulling a poorly terminated line will be as easy as changing your shoelaces. 

Then you find out Jeff fucked off all the labeling and half the ports are going to the wrong place and spend the weekend sorting it out./r/cableporn would enjoy this. Welcome to /r/cableporn ;) It's all manner of 'how you cable'.

It's going to still be difficult to maintain the cabling, to add or remove single cables.

There's also excessive pressure pulling down on most of those terminations, and it's not all uniform. This would fail QC in most large data centers and POPs.

It looks nice superficially though.It's all fun and games until you have to repatch somethingAhh the difference between people who just do enough to get by and those who actually value their own work.

Often times, they are end-of-life package cars repainted white.This is what all UPS trucks looked like before the brown trucks started working for less money.That was incredibly conscientious of you to not shoot it.

Damn thing's amelanistic. Albinos don't have pigment in the logo and the headlights would be pink.UPS did this to make sure your package survives a nuclear bomb.  They did this because white paint reflects more visible and infrared light than dark paint. As a result, a truck underneath dark paint is burned more than a truck covered by white paint.  This was first discovered by nuclear engineer, Shitty McFat Tits, back in 1943.  At the time he was shunned by the scientific community and asked to move to the hot, hot Sun, where he lives today as the King.  Of the Moon.  You see, UPS cares so much about things like your iPad being delivered that they started testing this out in select markets.  However, they did this without your consent.

It's such a nice thing for the clinic to do.  I'm really glad other clinics are doing it too.  Condolences for your loss :(.[deleted]When my Shepherd passed away, we took him to the vet for cremation. The main Vet that treated him was not here at the time. We live about a 30 minute drive from the Vet. As I was pulling into our driveway returning home, my cell phone rang, and it was the vet who had not been there ,and she was in tears telling us how sorry she was for our loss. That meant so much to us.  Sorry for your loss OP.I got a tattoo on the bottom of my foot of my old dogs paw print from a card like this. He was walking with me around the world, now he's walking with me forever. Oh I'm so sorry for your loss. :(  The feeling you get when you realize the vet was thinking of you as well is just heartbreaking. 

When I put my cat down last year, the vet made a plaster disc with a paw imprint from his paw. Made me break down again when I opened it.  

[Here.  :(](http://imgur.com/KGBiNlr)A card like this means so much. 

A little more than five years ago my indoor/outdoor cat was hit by a car. She crawled her way back to my front porch, so when I opened the door at my usual time before going to bed, I found her. So at 12:30 AM on a Friday night I rushed her to the only emergency vet clinic in town. 

I was a poor college student. More like a completely broke college student with hardly enough gas to even make it across town to the clinic. After expensive lab work and X-rays, the vet had terrible news. My beloved cat, my first pet ever had a shattered hip and multiple punctured organs. I was devistated. 

Not only did I have to make the decision to put her down, but I was also trying to figure out how to pay this monstrous fee. X-rays, lab work, euthanasia.... The vet could tell money was tight and offered to write off the euthanasia fee. I was so thankful! 

I never expected anything else. The clinic did everything they could to treat my cat. They helped me financially, and then I receive a simple, but beautiful card in the mail. The clinic also helped me emotionally by sending a card. I means so much. I still have the card. It's saved in a box with my cats collar and pictures. I miss her every day. 

That's one thing they don't tell you about losing a pet, the pain never goes away. You still love and miss them every day. I have four pets now and love them so much, but they cannot replace the love of a first pet. 

That's why a card like this is so important. Op, I'm sorry for your loss and know you will find pet love again, even if it's not the same. I had to put my german shepherd down when he was nine years old. I got to stay with him until he died and I'll never forget those last few moment together. Our vet didn't give us anything sentimental, but a year later, I was going through my sheet music (I play the piano) and saw a muddy paw print on one page. I had a bad habit of leaving my music on the floor and he must have stepped on it. It's placed next to his collar now. It's been 4 years and I still miss him. The feelsoh, boy, the feels.I had to put my cat down in 2009 because she got into antifreeze from a neighbor who constantly worked on cars outside. Saddest day of my life thus far. I was only 16, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to be in the room when they put her down but my mom practically forced me to. ""Go say goodbye to your baby!"" Ugh crying as I write this. I held onto her and sobbed as they put her to sleep and the vet assistants teared up too. We opted to get her cremated, and the crematory service actually came to our house and delivered the urn to us by hand. She was a sweet older lady and our older cat seemed really happy with her presence. Gave us comfort in a really sad time, now I have an 18 year old cat who's aging pretty fast and I'm not even close to ready...Had the opposite reaction when we had to put my cat down when I was a kid. The vet sent us a letter saying if we had just given them more money and gone in more often she would have survived. She had cancer and we went in as soon as we noticed something was up but we couldn't afford to try to cure it so we had to put her down. Getting that letter from the money grubbing vets was extremely upsetting while we were grieving. We never went back thereHi Everyone! Vet tech here. I do a few of these a week on a slow week. It's a somber job, trying to manipulate someones dead, loved pet into getting a good paw print, but it's one of the things that I love about my job. I know how much your pet meant to you, and it's the least I can do to capture a last remembrance for you.

I just lost my dog this month. I didn't get a note from the vet because I am the vet.  We knew it was coming, and that nothing could be done, but that doesn't help. I'm embarrassed that I'm having such a hard time about it, but I really am. I feel like she's saying, ""Why couldn't you help me?"" in this picture: [Mavis](http://i.imgur.com/VhrPezu.jpg)It's been almost a month since I put my beagle Hope down. The cancer was just too much for her to handle. One of the worst days of my life. I was lucky to have her for 10 of her 15 years on the planet.

The next day I received a card similar to this in the mail from my vet's office. Took me a few days before I could open it. 

And a few weeks later I received a card from Beagle Freedom Project. Two of my co-workers donated some money to them and they sent me a card in Hope's memory. 

Probably one of the nicest things anyone has done for me.I'm not crying, you're crying.I put my dog down October 28, 1999. Two months later I got on of these...from the veterinary school at UC Davis. 

To be clear, I didn't give permission for my dog to be donated to science...I have a heart condition, I wouldn't be able to handle this to be honest. I live alone with my dog and I'm pretty sure when he goes I will too. I honestly have really nothing else keeping me here.My heart hurts for you. 
I had a Molly of my own until a couple short months ago. :(

She went downhill very fast, less than three days from when we noticed an issue with constant pacing until we had to make a decision.

My wife is a veterinarian, and she struggled while trying to diagnose the issue. We suspect a brain tumor.

I am very sorry for your loss. :(

This was my Facebook status on May 19th, the day after we had to have her euthanized. 

Im heartbroken. I look at the couch where Molly used to lay. Shes not there. I see tennis balls around the house and know Ill never throw another one for her, or have to fight her to get it back so I can throw it again.

She deteriorated so quickly it caught us by surprise. I think the first sign something was really wrong was Thursday night when she couldnt stop pacing and wouldnt climb up in my lap so I could cuddle her.

She was responding to voice commands but not very well, and she would run into the wall or other objects as she paced.

Cindy is a very competent vet, but she was second guessing herself on everything she had done so far with Molly and trying to diagnose her. 

We took her in to the emergency veterinarian on Saturday early morning when Molly got up and immediately started pacing again. The doctor there examined Molly and came to the same conclusions that Cindy had, that the issue was likely neurological and not toxin related. 

Molly wasnt presenting the right symptoms for an ingested toxin, she wasnt getting better at all and her tests came back clear for liver and kidneys. 

We were referred to the Blue Pearl clinic in Blaine. Cindy took her there and Molly was held for observation overnight. Cindy could hardly sleep as she kept expecting a phone call overnight saying that Molly had started seizing, or that something else had happened.

A quick call on Sunday morning around 9AM to Blue Pearll told us that Molly did not appear to have progressed further. We were still waiting for results from the CSF (Cerebral Spinal Fluid) tap to find out whether it was an inflammatory issue leading to pressure in the brain, or pain in Mollys body. Results wouldnt come back until Monday (today).

Cindy and I drove to Blaine yesterday to visit Molly 

They brought her in to the room and I was devastated. Molly couldnt sit still, she had to pace. She paced in a circular pattern to the right, non-stop. 
She couldnt see, her right pupil was much larger than her left one, and her right eye did not appear to be pointing in the same direction as her left. 

She didnt recognize Cindy or I. She couldnt even eat or drink unless we held her and hand fed her or we pushed her nose into the water dish.

Yesterday was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I held her as they gave her the injection

Molly was my baby and I'm lost without her.

We had to put my cat down in December of 2012, at the age of 15. I had had him since I was 9 years old, and I was basically inconsolable.

The emergency vet that we took him to was incredible, even though it was literally the first time we had ever seen any of these people. The vet was incredibly sensitive and the staff were amazing as well. One of the receptionists started to cry when we came out, and the tech who handled the post-euthanasia stuff when we left was really sweet. We got a plaster cast of his paw and a little tuft of his fur that they gathered and cleaned. They also sent us a card afterwards.

I really hope we never have to use them again, but if we do, they're the only emergency clinic we'll ever use for any of our animals.A little while after our dog was put down, we received a nice card with handwritten notes from Vet and all the techs (probably because we were such huge messes). Then later down the line we received a letter saying they donated to the animal shelter in our dogs name. So much sobbing. Animal lovers are amazing people.I have to put mine down in a week and this shit hit home real hard. Oh the feels.Abandon thread!!!My sister is with [Sammy](http://i.imgur.com/g6CceaH.jpg) right now.  I spent the last 2 hours laying in the sun with him.  He's 16 and it's time.  I've preparing for today for a couple of weeks now.  The vet is literally on her way right now.  I'm just here killing time while my sister is sobbing in the yard.  

I am glad he gets to me near me and my family.  Jessie, the vet, is bringing a mold for his paw.  My son is 10 months old, so he doesn't understand why everyone is so down today.  

I am having a plaque made for Sammy, I am putting right between him and our black lab, Jake, who was buried last year.  Here is a poem I am having engraved for Jake and Sammy.  Thought you might like it.  Sorry about your puppy.  It's never easy, but I am glad that you and I chose vets that care as much as they do.  




A DOG ON HIS MASTER




As young as I look,

I am growing old faster than he,

seven to one

is the ratio they tend to say.

Whatever the number,

I will pass him one day

and take the lead

the way I do on our walks in the woods.

And if this ever manages

to cross his mind,

it would be the sweetest

shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass.

-Billy Adams

Good on the animal hospital for doing a little extra. And Molly was one lucky dog to have a loving home for even a fraction of her life, compared to so many others. I want to leave work and go hug my puppy right now. :(Having to put your dog down is one of the toughest thing anyone can experience. I had to put my little Bichon Frise down after 9 years because she developed a tumor on the right side of her head. The doctor said she had an extremely high number of white blood cells, and that it'd be very very expensive to try to cure her of this cancer. After my sister and I sat down and talked about, we made the hardest choice we've ever had to make. 

A dog is a part of your life. There's no greater feeling when you come home than seeing a pet you love dearly greet you with a ferocious swing of her tail and an excited jump on your leg. 

I had to travel to Mexico soon after we put her down, and my family there kept telling me to get over it because it was only a dog. **THAT** is the worst thing a grieving dog owner can hear. In all honesty, fuck you if you ever say that to someone. A dog is part of someone's family. My condolences, my friend.

Than bacon & lettuce & homegrown tomatoes

Up in the mornin' out in the garden

Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one

Plant `em in the spring eat `em in the summer

All winter with out `em's a culinary bummer

I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'

Everytime I go out & pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes homegrown tomatoes

What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes

Only two things that money can't buy

That's true love & homegrown tomatoes

You can go out to eat & that's for sure

But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure

Put `em in a salad, put `em in a stew

You can make your very own tomato juice

Eat `em with egss, eat `em with gravy

Eat `em with beans, pinto or navy

Put `em on the site put `em in the middle

Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life I lead

I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed

`Cause I know what this country needs

Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see

When I die don't bury me

In a box in a cemetary

Out in the garden would be much better

I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes

It was absolutely spectacular. There was so much enthusiasm in the crowd. About half the crowd was wearing red, the other white, and whenever Manchester United scored, there was so much fanfare. 

I wish the World Cup would come to the USA again. I was at this game! It was hard to pay attention with all the crowd waving going on hahah.

First of all, awesome.  I love this guy and fly fishing.  Secondly, you failed to mention Leonardo DiCaprio was there.In the 3rd grade, in '76, nobody, I mean nobody, was cooler or bigger than the Fonz.  

I still remember boys from another class walking in, about 4 in a row with ""The Fonz"" shirts, going ""heeeeeyyyyy...""

So often celebrity-fan pictures end up being washed out, close-up crapy shots. Even the ones you get at cons are sterile and boring. But this is definitely a frame-worthy picture.

It's so much more common than we think it is, but there it is, glaring at youWhy didn't they name it Janus?Wait.. This is like, a legit Chimera, right? Not just a calico?[Familiar](http://www.animecapsule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Zetsu-Gallery.jpg)Looks a lot like Vivec.I don't like cats.

I like this cat.Black Zetsu!Praise Vivec.Ah yes, Venus the recurring karma machineJust thought id add some clarifying info for common myths associated with these 'chimera' cats. Being a chimera is a biological phenomenon where the genetic material of two seperate people (fraternal twins) fuse into one being in uetero. Often when a person finds out about this it is becuase certain genetic tests do not match (for example the story of the mother whos cheek swab and reproductive cells didnt match, so she failed a maternity test). A common myth is that the person is born with body parts that are genetically different, which from a medical standpoint makes no sense since many bodily functions require specific genotypes that can change sibling to sibling (blood type etc.). Meanwhile in many animal species two things exist that could cause this cats eye/fur pattern. Heterochromia is relatively common in cats and dogs and even can happen to people once in a while, it is simply an issue of each eyes pigment being different. Also specifically in cats there is a fur pattern called calico, it is basically a random pattern of many fur types and is also common. The chances of a cat having both seem more likely than the chance of two embryos merging EXACTLY in the middle of the face with no sort of deformity or other indication of two genetic codes. Chances are its just a cat who happened to get the genes for both.

I believed him.Who signed your bike?If only there was another sign for the crushed sign to see.I've always thought the sign ""watch for falling rocks"" to be pretty useless.

Like, how should you alter your driving to avoid a rock falling on top of you? Do you speed up to pass through quicker? Do you slow down? Do you drive in a zig zag pattern and hope it lands somewhere else?

Browsing through movies in aisles just gives me this feeling that I like. I miss the smell of blockbuster, no matter what one i go to they all smell the same. cool. I can finally return my VHS of Johnny Mnemonic.While I agree opening a new one is weird, I just moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, and there are three of them here. All with cars in the parking lot every dayThat's not the second coming I expected.The internet speeds in your town must be horrid.Here's what I miss about blockbuster:

1.Renting video games. My parents couldn't really afford to buy me a bunch of games as a kid so they would rent me games instead. The excitement of walking in the store and choosing a game to rent was awesome. I basically had to pee as soon as I stepped into the store, thats how excited I used to get. 

2. Renting Consoles: When the N64 first came out, my parents couldn't buy it for me so I would rent the console and a game for a weekend (or was it a week? I cant remember) and just play the shit out of Mario 64. (or a different game if it was sold out) The downside to that was I had to start over if I didn't beat the game before I had to return it because by the time I rented it again I would either get a different cartridge without my save file or someone overwrote the save.

3. Pokemon Snap/Stadium sticker booth. You could go in with a memory card and print out a mini reel of stickers you took in those games from a special booth for like 2-3 bucks. It was pretty goddamn cool to me in my childhood. Actually, I would definitely print out lots of stickers if I came across one of those today. 

4. There was this Nickelodeon contest in the early 2000s where you could pick up these little cards that contained a hidden win/lose message that only revealed itself when held up to a certain colored light. I cant remember the specifics but they used to give away a bunch of them every time I visited. I never won anything but I was a dumb naive kid so I was excited at the chance of winning a bunch of cool video games and stuff. Red Box is playing a prankBetter clear your schedule for the closing sale next week.A video easy just opened up down the road from where I work and holy shit is it doing good buisness, I was filling my car across the road from this place  at 7pm and people were lining up and going in and out.

I really really really really miss Blockbuster. Watching movies online at your leisure is not the same as going down to your local Blockbuster (In my case, I had to walk with my buddies, making it kind of a trip) and looking through all of the crazy movies they had, trying to find something that looked like it would hold your attention. Then you find something obscure, and you watch it all together. Now you have a bond. You found some random-ass movie in this video store, just because it looked fun to watch, and you watched it, and whether it was good or not, it didn't matter. You all could talk about this movie that you had to search for, and sometimes it ends up being your favorite movie, a staple within your group of friends.

And that's special.
If anyone knows plot twists, it's Blockbuster.No no guys, it's [Blockblister!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjgUblUtOR8)Ok who broke time?

It was the second fire in as many years that claimed that title in/near our city (Colorado Springs).

Anyway, his job was to use a bulldozer to build fire lines. This obviously means bull dozing through people's properties. Being a semi-rural and yet wealthy area, one resident wasn't happy with this. He stopped the firefighter and demanded to know why this was necessary. The fire fighter looked at him and said ""either I build this fire break or we let your house burn. Your choice."" The man thought for a second and decided his house was worth saving. ""Alright, fine, continue on.""

Also some fire fighters had to avoid certain parts of that area due to some residents threatening to kill any government worker who got close. Kind of sad really.bae caught me firefightinGoddamnit, Stannis! You've got a kingdom to take, no time to be messing around with silly little fires!

I'm curious as to how you take care of the death of an animal that lived to be almost 200 years old. 

Edit- tortoise :)Fuck me, I didn't realise Steve Irwin was 176 when he died.That tortoise got to meet the two coolest people born in the past 200 years.This tortoise has seen some clothing changes in his time. I met that tortoise.... hahaAre we 100% sure that tortoise was Darwins? I went on a behind the scenes tour of the spirit library in London's Natural History museum as part of my Zoology degree, and they have a 100% verified dead tortoise that belonged to Darwin, it died shortly after he brought it back due to the cold weather and lack of diet knowledge so it's only about the size of a small plate...

The woman giving the tour said that there was/is a place in Australia that claims to have Darwin's tortoise but it was in fact found out it was completely the wrong species, and it was impossible for it to have been his.

Not saying it isn't as old as they are saying though... But it may not have ever actually met Charles Darwin, and even more unlikely that it was his pet, since as far as I know, he only had one pet, and it's very dead and in London.In all seriousness, I wonder what we've been able to research and find out about how these particular animals live so longIs that Sarah Connor? RIP Steve. These posts still make me kinda sad.That's so nuts how old they getWhat if Darwin discovered a slightly extended life serum and gave it to the turtoise. He thought that if it worked humans in the future would try to learn why the animal lived for so long and find out what was different.

And people just buried it when it died...Steve was one of the realest niggas there ever was. Punk ass stingray.He died like he lived...with animals in his heart.Steve Irwin wouldn't have died if he didn't insist on taking selfies with every wild animal he came across. Although an elderly tortoise is certainly safe enough.Not many posts truly get me thinking but this one is just about blowing my mind.

I end up sitting there stirring my fucking coffee for 10 minutes before the sugar cubes dissolve enough to actually make my coffee sweet, but they never really fully dissolve unless you're willing to wait 20 minutes to drink your fucking coffee.  So by the time I get to the end of my cup it's just a fucking cup bottom full of coffee flavored sugar.

Anyhow, these 3d printed ones do seem to expose somewhat more surface area so I suppose they're less horrible than regular sugar cubes.Can you print the creamer into little cow udders, and milk bottles?  That would be **so** freaking cute.3d printing, what fantastic times we live in. :D To think when we are all dead this technology will be either as common as a microwave or obsolete.Such surface area, wow.3D systems, biggest scumbags of the 3D printing world.3D Printers: Making diabetes fun since 2014Sweeeet!!Check your blood sugar!""cubes""For some absinthe.Acid.These would be a great addition to a 3D printing cafe....The way this thing makes cubes reminds me of [Patrick trying to make snowballs](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/1881317/patrick-making-snowballs-o.gif)

Thousands won't need it, but that one, that's what it's about. My sister got ran over by my grandpa's riding mower. She tried to hop on the back of it while he was mowing. She fell, he didn't see her, and the then he backed right over her. She almost lost her leg and I watched the whole thing go down. One of the worst sounds I've ever heard. Warning signs have become more and more graphic over the years. The deck of an old mower would have a silhouette of a hand with a chunk missing. New mowers depict all four fingers completely severed with blood squirting out of the stumps. Another 5 years and warning labels are going to look like the front page of r/gore.That's a real problem! I don't allow my kid to be in the yard while I mow. I don't allow her to ride on it with me either.
Way to many sad stories of kids getting hurt from mowing accidents. 

If u should wear safety glasses while mowing or trimming then you should be aware that any person around you could get hurt from something being shot out of the mower shoot as well.

I know reddit has no boundaries on what's funny for people, but remember it's not funny if u injure you child with a mower blade.http://i.imgur.com/Z8jLLqJ.gifChild services took them away from me, goddamnit riding mower, why do you have to open old wounds?Possibly the worst mower to buy after you had a miscarriage ""I told you, sign, I don''t know!""Oh god, the horror of riding any kind of garden vehicle on school grounds. If there's a kid within X distance of it, you *have* to move at a speed that ensures that you can come to a complete stop within the time it takes that kid to cover X distance, because they *can* and *will* dart off in any random direction at any random moment with complete disregard to their surroundings.  
Hell, I've had situations where I'm walking down one of the hallways carrying a ladder, and some kids come racing around the corner and *barrel* down the hallway towards me, all without ever looking where they're going. Cue me almost smacking myself in the face with the ladder because I had to hoist it up in the air in time for them to run underneath instead of smashing into it. *Situations*, plural. This happened regularly.

Goddamn kids, mumble grumble.I'm an ER doc, one of the worst things I've ever seen was a young girl who wound up under one of these things. Lost a leg. So, it does happen.This might be slightly humorous to some people but it is needed. I had a friend in high school who, when he was 3 or 4, fell off the porch while his dad was mowing and he ended up loosing an arm and a good chunk out of his leg. Now one of his legs is about 4 inches shorter than the other one. It seems like common sense but sometimes even the simplest of brain farts at the wrong time can be detrimental.  As a yard-work and wood-working active father, I have made it my absolute habit to ask three questions every time I'm about to power something up:

Where is the tool?
Where am I?
Where are my kids?
(Where are my dogs?)

If you stop yourself, every time, with this kind of check - any time you're about to do anything that could remotely backfire - you're cutting down risk of accident considerably, in my book.

And it takes about 5 seconds ;)Aside from running them over, it's super important to stay vigilant on watching where you point the trimmings at. I ran over a rock and pinged my neighbors dog in the leg. He yelped so loud I heard it over the motor :( 
Sad about her dog, glad it wasn't a kid...So, I take it this thing is not suitable for mowing children?Damn it now I can't say I didn't know.The diagram is macabre.
But if they may not be on the lawn at the time, how are you supposed to cut their hair?Its got the warning circle because he obviously missed the kid.  Ensure your kids are under the lawnmower, not next to itI make prosthetic limbs for a living.  I have two children who have to wear one b/c their parent's thought riding along was cute and fun. I thought I was in /r/funny for a minute...Because it probably happens all the time. Kids die every day from equipment and automobile injuries. Accidents happen.That kid is massively overweight To be fair my favorite hiding place as a kid was always in the blades of a riding lawn mower. 

This warning is 100% necessary for safety. I don't want to know about the stories that led to the creation of this sign. They make them because likely just that scenario has happened...

I can tell by his button nose and his t-shirt looks like it cost $100 more.So which one is Mark Wahlberg?He is so fine.

My buddy said he was going across the street because they had awesome Mediterranean food so I went with.  It was about 8:30pm so the sun was just about gone, but the line was like 75 people deep, I'm like ""shit i'm not waiting that long for food.""  As we walk up everyone very kindly tells us we can go to the front of line because they can't eat yet.  We got our food and sat at one of the outside tables, I felt very, very, uncomfortable because everyone was just staring at us, you could tell they were starving.  About 10 min later someone rang a bell and all hell broke loose, it was officially ""sunset"" for them to eat.  It was controlled chaos, everyone was trying to get through the line as fast as they could, with no regard for personal space.  The area stoners have to be pleased, as well. I always feel like a prick when I walk into an Arabic restaurant during Ramadan to eat, but the food is so delicious.Saw this guy on the 4th of July, jumped off my porch knocking over my hookah and screamed stop like a little child. There's also a hot dog stand on Warren from midnight until 4am with huge lines. Muslim children are not required to fast for Ramadan until they reach the age of puberty.Have to make money somehow.Here in peckham we have icecream vans at 1am all year round! No entirely sure they sell icecream...I work with a couple Muslims and they've been grumpy as fuck the last few weeks. We can eat when it's dark outside. Depending on your city/country location depends on what time you have to stop eating and start fasting, and also what time you can break your fast in the evening. I'm on the East Coast of the U.S, I wake up at 3:00am to eat suhoor (morning meal), then stop before prayers. I have about a 20 minute window. I can break my fast tonight starting at 8:32pm. You best believe we all have every timer/clock/cell phone ready to go off. For mornings I typically have oatmeal, few dates, organic baby food (that's just a preference to get veggies in), water, Pedialyte (was a godsend when I ran a marathon and I use it for fasting now), random bites of banana or seasonal berries, and sometimes an egg or two. I'm American, but foreign born Muslims usually eat food/drink from their country of origin. I'm not a big sweets eater and they make you crash, so I don't eat pastries, sweetened tea, biscuits, etc. Again, just preference. Some people eat more, some less. I'm a woman, so if I have my period, have a serious illness (eating disorder, cancer, surgery, etc), I am exempt. Also exempt when traveling or breastfeeding or pregnant, although some pregnant/breastfeeding women choose to eat less or still fast. You have to keep track of your missed fasting days and can make them up later. People who have long term illnesses and cannot fast typically give money or time to charity. In the evenings when breaking the fast (iftar), depending on if it's at home or in a group setting it can be a hearty family meal or it can be an all-out Thanksgiving style food fest. Depends on country, location, who's cooking and usually the temperature. I don't eat pasta or tons of heavy food at night because of the summer heat. Tonight I will be having grilled chicken, greek salad with feta, hummus, carrots, some leftover jasmine rice, water mixed with Pedialyte to re-hydrate and a Diet Coke. Chocolate cherry ice cream for dessert because the fat kid inside me wanted it. After I eat I will pray either at home or the mosque, some people then sit around chatting with friends and relaxing, and some do taraweh, which is night prayers (not mandatory, but extra for the holiday). Depending on weeknight or weekend is when everyone is home relaxing or out and about. Since the US isn't a Muslim dominated country, we do our fasting and routines around normal work days, family, etc. In Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia, EVERYTHING shuts down. You mellow out at home, nap, relax, prepare food for the meals, or spend your time praying. Eid is the holiday directly after the Ramadan fasting. Almost like Easter in that we all wear new clothes, pray, get together with family, eat a lot, and the kids get small gifts, money and candy. The second highest Muslim concentration is San Diego, California.Fuck yea, Dearborn represent! As a lifeguard at the civic center, I love Ramadan with the sweet, sweet sound of silence in the pool. All the restaurants hopping downtown at 2 in the morning is awsome too. Michigan will never stop amazing me.>###MUSLIM VAMPIRES TERRORIZING NEIGHBORHOOD ICE CREAM TRUCKS, IS YOUR FAMILY SAFE?And we're out in the suburbs, mad that all the food places close at 9. I'm driving to Dearborn from now on!That is the U.S. I'm proud of. Tolerance and finding an innovative way to make a buck.  
Glad your community embraces its Muslim citizens.If I didn't know that and just happened to move to that place, I would fucking shit my pants if I hear the ice cream truck at 1:00 am, they should have a clown driving it to top it of. Children are not required to observe Ramadan until maturity (as well as pregnant women, the elderly, and the sick/frail). I do think it's awesome that they do stuff like this for Ramadan, but I hope that the children are observing healthy eating habits too!When I was in Iraq in 2011 during Ramadan, I was always pretty jealous of all of the festivals and parties we saw at night while on patrol. The Muslim culture is incredibly interesting except for the few radicals out there. What happens if you were hypoglycemic? I'm Muslim and that's business not the kindness of his heat haha. Maybe a bit of both.Ramadan, putting the *slim* in MuslimI have a lot of respect for Muslims here in the west that do this.  They take their religion seriously and believe in it.  Following through with this part of their faith, in a society which doesn't necessarily cater to them takes some conviction.

After pondering all I can come up with is fire rockets.There is only one thing to do: install a rocket launcher controlled by the bed light.[deleted]Its the button to activate the shower>As we were driving

>Button on far left side of drivers side

Was your child sitting on your lap?And when you're alone in the car, you'll look around to see if anybody is watching, and you'll press the button pretending that you're launching a rocket and clearing the traffic in front of you. I suspect you'll also be making launch and explosion sound effects as you do so. I can imagine North Korea stealing this picture and make it one of their propaganda/fear images.It does resemble the NATO/STANAG symbol for rocket/MRL artillery.

http://www.sfsidewalkastronomers.org/

Their most famous member is John Dobson, who apparently just died. He invented/popularized the telescope design that the OP's photo shows - it's called a ""Dobsonian"" mount.

There's a documentary about him called A Sidewalk Astronomer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sidewalk_AstronomerSo did you take a look at jupiter?We need more people like this who want to share the amazing parts of the world, just for the satisfaction of opening eyes to new things.Holy shit I would jump all over that.

Where was this?On our honeymoon to Hawaii, my wife and I went to a roof top observatory at our hotel.  There were about 10 other couples for that viewing and not one of them ever stopped talking and half the people didn't look through the fucking telescope.  Here was this super enthusiastic guide with a very expensive telescope and a super dark sky, trying to talk and these fuckers were completely ignoring him while having their own conversations (loudly).  It was $25 a person and absolutely awesome.  To this day I have no idea what the fuck those assholes were up there for.  Really Cool, not at all sad. lots of people have never looked through a telescope, ever. It's really something!!Some people just want to watch the world learn!Except he is blind, and the telescope is pointed at the sun.A couple years ago while camping my kids (12 and 10 at the time) and I set up our good set of binoculars on the tripod to look at Jupiter. While wasn't much more than a bright dot you could also see four of the moons quite clearly.

As we were looking a girl in her early 20's walked by and asked what we were doing. My oldest (a budding astronomer) explained in detail about the planet, the moons, distances etc. Pretty soon we had a line of people wanting to look with my junior astronomer giving lessons. 

People are hungry for this kind of thing. All it takes is giving them an opportunity. 

And my kid learned when to just shut up and nod when some drunk guy started in about some conspiracy about satellites instead of trying to correct him.the old shoe-polish-on-the-lookie-hole gag... *classic*I took this iPhone photo of Saturn through a telescope like that.

He sets up like 3 or 4 scopes for anyone that wants to look. One of them is a big Meade LX series. I think it's the 8 inch. That's a big heavy thing to lug around and set up and he does it like 3 nights a week. He's a real cool dude.This man and his telescope alone could inspire a child to pursue science and astronomy and that would be beautiful. My former neighbor (an astrophysicist) used drop fliers all around the neighborhood inviting people to come join him for skywatching out in front of his house. He'd set up his telescope and enthusiastically talk about the things we were looking at. Unfortunately no one other than my family ever bothered to show up. They didn't know what they were missing!In the tradition of John Dobson.. some good old sidewalk astronomy! :)I think that's awesome that he is so excited about it that he wants to share it with everybody.  Far worse ways to spend your retirement, like feeding coins into a one-armed-bandit.I miss my grandpa. :( This same fellow showed me Saturn outside a dark bar in New York City 20 years ago.  It changed my life forever.A good buddy of mine got his PhD in Astrophysics . . . while he was in his program, he was very involved in outreach.  He sometimes set up telescopes on the streets of Harlem, and told me about a mother who cried when seeing the reaction of her kid as he looked through the telescope. That's damn cool, and perhaps THE most expensive telescope you will ever see in your entire life. That model of telescope costs thousands of dollars.

The only more powerful ""commercial"" scopes available are the types that are ""fold-out"" (look em up - basically what OP posted but with additional tubing/magnification). You will typically ONLY find these the fold-out type available to the public during public dark site meetings. 

Usually the only people who get to use such high powered equipment are those who own them, those who are in the field, and students at universities that attend classes which go to dark sites (AND, those who attend PUBLIC dark-site meetings, which very few know about).

I had the great joy in my life of taking an astronomy class (a great interest of mine, but no where near my degree) in which, for a grade, we had to attend a dark site twice. It was AMAZING. I actually got to see Saturn AND it's rings through one of these ultra powerful type telescopes. I was even able to snap of a picture through the eye port with an old film camera of the rings and when developed you could still make out the rings. 

I strongly recommend you look up local 'dark sites', which is where you will find FREE use of sweet shit like this.

I just hope this comment gets a few views, instead of all the bullshit comments that are at the top.I would of spent as much time as he was willing to give, talking to him. A lot of people see older folks as a nuisance but I love learning and interesting talk so I often talk to older folks. Especially ones with awesome telescopes who probably share the same great interest in space like I do.The man who invented that type of telescope mount, John Dobson, used to do that exact thing.  He'd setup a telescope in public for anyone to look through.  He died this year.I set mine up at the local park during the last eclipse and during the transit of Venus. :)I was reading a post yesterday about awful it is when older people act more arrogant, greedy, and just generally more unpleasant as they age. The consensus was that a lot of these elderly folks simply reach a point where they say ""fuck it,"" and just don't give a shit anymore, which often leads down a negative route of insensitivity and apathy.

This fuckin' boss of an old man, however, has taken the ""fuck it"" attitude and harnessed something truly amazing. He's decided, ""fuck it, am going to take my telescope-in-a-red-suitcase-with-wheels, set up shop in a parking lot, and *give* something to people. A different planet every day. No, every hour. Fuck it, doesn't matter, because I'm the fuckin' guy in charge, and I'm the one who decides which planet my fuckin' interchangeable sign will display.""

It's a closer look at the universe, a glimpse into the past, and a bit of magic all rolled into one.

I read about 30&thinsp;000[^[S]](http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/protest-putin102.html) ...In an unrelated story, 70,000 Russians have come down with radiation poisoning. Police are investigating, but suspect rampant homosexuality may be to blame.Those damn Americans and their seeding of this march. /s

.


^(For context, I was in an argument with a Russian guy that was convinced that the US was to blame for starting the uprising in Ukraine to begin with.)I remember the largest world wide protest in history against the atrocities in Iraq. They stopped that war too.Good for them. I often feel that the Russian people get roped into a stereotype that they have had no control of. Just goes to show that they are on board with the rest of the world, unlike their leadership.To all the people who say Putin doesn't give a fuck about the protestors: Putin DOES give a very huge fuck about the protestors. That's one of the reasons all this shit is going down, because of the 2011-2012 protests in Moscow, which saw Putin's popularity plummet to an all-time low.

These protests disturbed him profoundly. Now imagine the protestors in Kiev overthrew a corrupt leader and actually made things better? What kind of message would that send to his own people? He is trying to show Russians that any ""revolutions"" will only lead to chaos and pain, even if successful.

He has always tried to keep a balance in his cabinet between reformers and hardliners. The Moscow protests of 2012 showed him the hardliners may have been right all along. 

Also, of course, he sees an historic opportunity to seize Crimea, a strategic port, without any retribution. 
And a million marched against Iraq in London. This changes nothing. Democracy is just the label. Contents may vary. Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.While Reddit is surprisingly sane when it comes to this whole crisiscertainly much saner than many Russian commentersthe complexity of this whole issue tends to be massively downplayed.

First of all, the absolute majority of Russians DO NOT want a war with Ukraine (and those who may want a full-blown intervention are just plain and simple loons). There's great kinship between Russians and Ukrainians, and so any such collision would feel like a civil war. The fact that Putin's rating has soared is simply because Russia feels Crimea is rightfully ours. And frankly, the fact that over the past sixty years Ukraine failed to integrate that region culturally, instead doing quite a bit to alienate it, says quite a bit about why there's so much elation in Crimea and Russia about the peninsula possibly becoming our part.

Secondly, what people here need to understand is that Putin is not, and never was, a dictator whom people abhor. The prison population in Russia right now is at something approaching an all-time low, the standard of living, on the other hand, at almost an all-time high. True, quite a few independent media have been brought to heel; nobody likes that. But there are still influential outlets remaining (Vedomosti, RBC, Echo Moskvy) that, the former especially, can be unequivocally critical.

Thirdly and most crucially, the situation in Ukraine is actually far from being an all-singing, all-dancing triumph of democracy. I don't know if anyone here knows about so-called ""friendship trains""; in a nutshell, those are trains full of thugs that the Pravy (Dexter = Right) Sectorwho more or less dominated Maydan, force-wisepromised to send to the East if they felt the Russian-speaking regions were becoming unruly. (Their interviews may still be available online.) As I am writing this, the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior has confirmed that the shooting in Kharkov was perpetrated by the Right Sector activists. Some of the Right Sector people have openly taken part fighting against Russia in Chechnya and then boasted of the actual kills. Many of them are pure Nazis who will willingly tell stories of how they beat up immigrant women and such. Again, hardly a bunch of people who simply went out for a walk and unexpectedly found themselves in the middle of a civil upheaval. These guys are violent as in ready to kill.

Sure, I don't like the fact that my country is seen as an aggressor right now; and above all I don't like it that I cannot understand what Putin's plan is. I hate it that many Ukrainians and generally liberally-minded people are now behaving as if Russia is replaying some sort of a WWII scenario, and I think it really sucks that a lot of my good contacts are posting all sorts of anti-Russian nonsense. All I am saying is, please don't think we're trying to rebuild an empire. It is more complicated than that.

Oh and yes, even though the whole warm water port reasoning is very valid, I personally think we don't need Crimea; I'd much prefer if it was autonomous, able to negotiate with Russia as a separate entity. The way things look right now, we're poised to have a massive economic clusterfuck.

Edit: many edits.

Edit #2: According to the Kharkov Accords about the Black Sea fleet, Russia is allowed to have up to 25 thousand military personnel stationed at naval bases in Crimea, plus certain types of artillery etc.

Edit final: Thanks for the gold, whoever gave it to me. As for all the other comments which seem to imply I'm some sort of a brainwashed pro-government goon: Guys, the last time I watched TV was fifteen years ago; most of my information is from independent or critically-minded sources. You all seriously need to calm down and understand that there can be PoVs different from your own, and that doesn't necessarily mean that whoever holds them is brainwashed. If it is easier for you to think of Russia as a poverty-ridden country that's armed to the teeth and is only waiting to try and recapture her former glory by unleashing a massive warthat's fine, but leave me out of that. I am not a great fan of Putin and I don't like what's happening in Crimea, but I don't think that justifies being hysterical. Thanks.Who's job is ""people counter?"" Is there a science or accepted method behind ""people counting?""That one Soviet flag is pretty rogue...and 100 million support the annexation of Crimea. Putin will get Crimea with no war. Nobody in the world has big enough balls to oppose him.Well, I guess it's good that they live in a country where they are free to protest.I had no idea the Moscow prison capacity was so highPutin was evidently taking notes when the invasion of Iraq was being plotted. Mass protests in London? ""Surely, the Brits will be forced to back down when their own people are against war! What? They didn't? Hmmm..."" *strokes chin; kills tiger; amends future plans*

Sure I might be an idiot, but at least I've got wings and beer.I was in this too and 15 minute drive turned into two hours.  I was floored at the amount of traffic, but I think that the speed with which everything was absolutely covered played a big part in all this madness. People waiting too long to head home then everyone left at the same time. However, the roads weren't that bad in the beginning. I didn't see anyone going through intersections, making turns, etc. slipping if they took their time, but it appears it got worse. Again though, the amount of traffic was mind-blowing.  I hope you're safe OP! 

Props for getting the Freds Beds truck in the photo. I realize this isn't going to be seen because I'm late to the party, but here's the deal from someone living here.

This storm was well modeled for days. However, local TV really down played it. Even as recent as Tuesday afternoon they were giving the impression that it would be an inch or two of snow despite models indicating much more snow and most importantly a bunch of ice. Last night they started to pick up on it, but left out the rather huge warning clues from NWS statements.

Now, two weeks ago there was a storm that was forecast to drop around 6 inches of snow. It ended up dropping about 2-3 inches instead. During this, the school district for the county Raleigh is located in canceled schools on a day where no precipitation fell at all. A lot of people made fun of this and then made fun of the fact they stayed closed for 4 total days.

Fast forward to today. The Wake county schools closed again, but in the AM there was no precipitation. It had been forecast to start around noon, so this was expected, but a lot of businesses gave the message of ""you need to be at work as usual"". Just after 12, the snow started falling in the area and in many places (including my parking lot at work), there was easily a half inch down in 10 minutes. 

The road crews had treated some of the major roads, but the fast rate of precipitation basically overtook the brine that was used. The feeder roads into those main roads were untreated.

Once people started to leave, everyone else felt the need to leave as well, and then here we are. The picture is ""funny"" because of the car fire, but the general reason for this was caused (IMHO) by local TV failing to take this seriously and the work-at-all-costs mentality of the area.

Anyway, have a laugh at us, but it's not as simple as people want to make it sound.

All these people are stuck on 440 and I'm just here snowboarding all over NCSU campus.I live in Raleigh. I was born in Philly, lived there as well as north and south NJ and Manhattan. I have been in, walked, played and driven in many snowstorms, blizzards and ice storms up there. I learned that snow down here is handled and experienced MUCH differently. When I moved here 5+ years ago I was managing a company. Snow was predicted for the next day (1 to 3 inches). Everyone was telling/asking (we are closed tomorrow right???). I was like ""Uhh... no. It is only 1 to 3 inches. This is nothing. You should plan to come into work tomorrow but be careful."" But to be safe I told them I would drive in first and then email everyone to let them know how it went. It snowed 1 to 3 inches the next morning. I drove in and then proceeded to call and email everyone.... ""DON'T COME IN!!!"" It was not just the snow that was the issue. It was the people driving and the sheet of ice that came with it as well. Holy Crap was it insane. I drove 5 miles and counted 7 accidents and many cars that just ran off the road. If snow comes in Raleigh... Shut it down! Shut it all down and lock yourselves inside! They don't have the infrastructure for it, the experience to drive in it or the cars conditioned to handle it. This is also the ""ice belt"" in the US. And ice, no matter where the hell you are, is impossible to drive on. I drove less than half a mile today after lunch in an AWD RAV4. Thing handled like a champ but it still took almost 30 minutes to get home. We were warned and prepared but it fell so fast today during lunch hour and nobody was expecting that. During the drive back I passed by another beast of a 4x4. This is what it looked like: http://i.imgur.com/9fV7WAT.jpg

Sit around with with lit candles for 10-20 minutes telling stories and then suddenly remember that there are some camping lanterns in the shed.  Send someone in there with just the light from their phone.  Perhaps lay out some butchered animal remains too on an impromptu butcher's slab.  Maybe make the floor a little sticky.  Chains hanging from the roof.  The odd rusty saw or bloody hammer.  Makeshift abattoir.  That sort of thing.

Follow them to the shed and make sure there's a bolt on the outside.

I'm no unidan, but here we go.

To answer some questions I've seen about the hornet nest, from the mind of a fellow biologist:

Hornets are the largest members of the Wasp family ( *Hymenoptera* ) whether or not these are true hornets, or a smaller member of the family, the nests are built the same way.

Wasps generally build their nest by chewing on the fibres of wood, creating a pulp containing the mulched wood and their saliva, and adding it to the nest in curved layers. This explains why the nest itself has a wooden texture, and why it is layered so delicately. You can see each wasp's contribution to the nest, and the vibrant colors that come from the different grains of different woods.

This also explains the creepy look on the face of the wooden statue. It has been chewed up little by little by these wasps as they slowly built their nest.

TL;DR wasps build nests with paper mulch by chewing on wood and mixing it with spit

Hope this helps!

EDIT: I found an [amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhEiz-2cS8k) that gives you a very close look at the nest and it's purpose in the life cycle of wasps. ScienceOnline has some other very cool videos, check them out![Nope.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sjy7Zdj-rI4/Ufn-pI4Ny4I/AAAAAAAADG8/G4oBOr-9Kmo/s1600/tumblr_inline_mlq5jcTVBp1qz4rgp.gif)>*""Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.""*

I was with friends one night cruising a back country road at speeds near 70. I just happened to see what looked like people standing in the middle of the road aways ahead. I told the driver to slow down, and luckily he did. At 45 we just could make out the outline of a moose. The driver slammed on the brakes and we came to a stop inches from it. The moose actually sniffed at the hood emblem on the car and then slowly meandered off.

It is important to note that I have phenomenal vision.

To expose to get the tones in the shadow of the white wall and at the same time getting a perfect exposure of a sunlit landscape is not possible with modern camera - the dynamic range of the sensors are not high enough.

More pictures and information about this dive can be found [here](http://www.tourismontheedge.com/extreme/diving-in-the-tectonic-plate-gap-between-europe-and-america.html).

Also, it should be pointed out that tectonics are more of a zonal thing. You can't necessarily say that the rocks on the left belong to the North American plate, while the rocks on the right belong to the Eurasian plate. The geologic processes that are occurring in the area are creating these valleys and canyons, but it is more of a fuzzy divide instead of a sharp clear one that the pictures make it out to be.

^^^Courtesy ^^^of ^^^[purple_people_eaters](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/19iu76/diver_swimming_between_tectonic_plates/c8ofj4s)What did one tectonic plate say when he bumped into the other?
""Sorry, my fault!""If he stayed there for another 50,000 years, he'd be toast!Guys, just remember. Swim THROUGH it. Not above or around, THROUGH it.I've done this, and it was one of the cooler experiences of my life. If you ever get to Reykjavik, check it out.  Every time you open your mouth, it's like drinking Evian.

Edit:  I had to wear a super heavy duty waterproof suit.  It was awesome to walk through the snow, and walk into the water.  Each time I came to the surface, light snowflakes hit my nose. I snorkeled, but you can scuba. You only go about 20ft lower in scuba.  

In Reykjavik, there are people who offer this.  It's about a 1 hour drive from the city.  I was there last summer, really beautiful landscape.

Here's a few pictures I took.

*Thousands of years later...*

:""Damn! Missed!""Fun fact, the season premiere of Game of Thrones that just aired had a scene that was filmed at this location. Not in the water obviously but at a different part of the same plate boundary a few minutes away. I was there a few days before they started filming. The water is insanely clear and blue, even more so than this picture lets on. 

This area was apparently the site of the rudiments of an ancient viking parliament too. The different viking crews would all meet there periodically to discuss viking shit. Shit's pretty magical.Here it is from a helicopter: 

http://web.stagram.com/p/560373124920864169_19586370 

The cracks go as deep as 197 feet. FYI these are not literally the tectonic plates. This is a valley created by the movement of the plates. The frontier of the plates are indeed there, but kilometers deeper.

No one will ever be able to be actually between tectonic plates. They float in fucking magma.Oh!!!! I was just there in March! I went dry suit snorkeling in the same area. It was an incredible experience.  

The water comes from Langjökull Glacier, the 2nd largest glacier in Iceland.  The glacier water is roughly 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) all the time and the water is so clear that you have 120 meters (393.7 feet) of vision all around you.  Also the water gets completely filtered through by volcanic rocks so it is safe to drink it and the guide told us to feel free to drink it, which I did and it was the most delicious water I've ever had.

For those of you who are curious as to what dry suit snorkeling is, you essentially wear a huge down feather body suit under a latex outer layer suit. There is tight latex around your wrists and neck (a little uncomfortable for those of you who have claustrophobia) and it keeps you completely dry.  You then get wet suit gloves and a head/face mask to keep the exposed parts of your body warm.  You are completely buoyant and pretty much float on the surface of the water without any effort.

TL DR: Iceland is an amazing place with incredible people, food, and nature. If you get the opportunity to go... DO IT, especially if you love the outdoors... and bring a Go Pro camera!I bet he's wet his pants because he is suffering from ""incontinents""  Iceland is an amazing place to visit. If you're not into diving you can go to a place where you can touch the North American tectonic plate and the European tectonic plate with your own wee hands.I've been there!

[I took this photo on a bridge.](https://i.imgur.com/QYtv6JP.jpg) The rocks to the right are the European plate and to the left is the American plate. We went on the glacier in the background after too.Who is going to make the gif of the plates *crushing him?*Serious question - Say, if the tectonic plates now had a sudden movement, would the diver go deaf? I immagine it being loud.[Donkey Kong IRL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH-UGtfGH8I#t=24)Dat basalt.[Here is a better link about it from an Iceland dive shop.](http://www.dive.is/dive-sites/silfra/)   I'm not at home or I'd post my own pictures from the trip.

I did this dive when I visited Iceland back in April 2012.  The water is only a sliver above freezing and it requires a dry suit which my body proportions (read that as: fatty) didn't like.  

The most amazing thing about it is the clarity of the water.  Normally when you SCUBA dive good visibility is 40-60 feet at best.  In this canyon, Silfra, and the lagoon it feeds into, the water is so clean and clear visibility is hundreds of feet.  The water that comes into this underwater rift valley comes directly from glaciers through volcanic rock and there is a slight current down the valley that slowly carries you along.  The water is so clean you can just drink it without any hazard.  I remember taking one big swallow and it was the cleanest water I've ever tasted.

The link posted by /u/Spartan2470/ gives a bit of a false impression of the place (not Spartan's fault).  The link says ""Saying this place is not tourist-friendly would be an understatement.""  This is just plain wrong.  It's not dangerous at all and there are no hot springs in this canyon, nor is it tectonically unstable.  You don't even need to scuba to experience it, you can snorkel instead.  You only need to wear a dry suit because the water is so cold.

In order to do the SCUBA you need a basic Open Water Certification.  You don't need to already have dry suit experience, they'll teach you the dry suit basics you'll need.  

When I did it, it was a half day experience from Reykjavik and cost about $250-$300 to do SCUBA.  It's less for snorkeling, obviously.

**TL;DR:** Amazing half day diving experience from Reykjavik that anyone can do.

Edit:  May king my English gooder then it were bee four.ITT: People with very little knowledge of tectonic plates. I wish people would stop referring to this picture as two "" tectonic plates"" because that is NOT what this is. This definitely should not make me nervous, but it does.As crazy as this looks, I did this with my 12 year old (but snorkeling, not scuba) last Summer.  Iceland is the most insanely tourist-friendly country.  It was a little advanced for her but her suit leaked (just above freezing) and she was such a good sport about it.   Also, with snorkeling you can see the bottom really easily.  Super super clear water.For those curious, this is actually a divergent plate boundary; as the plates moved, this gap widens. A diver would probably never notice a change as they moved","{'Sadness': 0.040447, 'Emotional_Range': 0.579, 'Tentative': 0.0, 'Confident': 0.248, 'Fear': 0.263996, 'Analytical': 0.286, 'Conscientiousness': 0.292, 'Agreeableness': 0.498, 'Joy': 0.062377, 'Disgust': 0.066022, 'Extraversion': 0.593, 'Openness': 0.405, 'Anger': 0.816976}","{'coral': 0.331812, 'scuba': 0.450166, 'water': 0.802184, 'sea': 0.450166, 'diving': 0.5, 'underwater': 0.425557, 'fish': 0.524979}"

Why does no one see this?I love it""And that, my son, is the story of how we traded with the white man, and got a baseball bat in exchange for a bow, an arrow and Botswana.""I bet we're going to see some mature and thought provoking comments here.

/sI like that you can see how confident and grown up each of the boys looks with their own weapon juxtapositioned with their incompetence and childishness when faced with learning the other cultures weapon.  Funny how kindness never really reciprocated from the European colonialists. anyone know if either of these boys are still alive? would be an interesting ama if we could track one of them downI love how innocent and open it all seems. It's like, 

""Wow, this thing is pretty cool! how do you use it? Ok, so I plant my feet like this, and draw back like so? That was pretty nifty! Say, you wanna play baseball with me? You don't know baseball!? it's only the greatest game ever! let me show you"" 

and all 

""You have to point your hips and your leading toe at the thing you want to shoot. Now pull the string back to your ear. Perfect! Now, point the arrow at the wild beast, and let it go! Baseball? I've never heard of it. The greatest game ever? I'd love to learn! So I gab the bat like so?""

Just like making friends at the park.

Of course, white boy may just be trading his knowledge of America's favorite pastime in exchange for bow lessons so that he can murder people and blame it one the tribe, but I try to be an optimist And that's how Africa became such a power in baseball, dominating the sport over traditional powers, USA and Japan.

That's why the sport was removed from the Olympics. The looks on the kids' faces while their teaching each other is incredible.""There are plenty of sticks around here asshole, give me my bow back!""Beautiful ""Try to run to home.""

""But it's not effective in catching dinner.

IIRC Canada did something similar during the closing ceremonies of Vancouver 2010 Well played Russia. Well played.Wow that was quickOverall, I say the Sochi Olympics was fantastic despite the negativity prior. Gives me hope for the WC in Russia in 201810/10. I like a good sense of humor. I would like to buy a drink for whoever thought that up.As an American who has been living in Russia for 5+ years I can tell you in some ways Russians are just like every person in the planet but in some things they do things that uniquely Russian. One which is that Russians are masters of deadpan, self deprecating, cynical and dark humor. Their humor is often far more subtle and what we are used to. Once you understand that aspect of Russian society you will quickly realize that humor is actually a much more larger part in normal life in Russia than it is in the US and western Europe. 

Below is an example of Russian humor.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were going camping. They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: ""Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you see."" Watson replied: ""I see millions and millions of stars."" Holmes said: ""And what do you deduce from that?"" Watson replied: ""Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, its quite likely there are some planets like Earth out there. And if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life."" And Holmes said: ""Watson, you idiot, it means that somebody stole our tent.""Good for them. No one really thinks less of them for it in the first place, I, for one, think higher of them for poking fun at this non-issue.What's going on?THEY PLANNED IT THE WHOLE TIME

I miss living in Ottawa, great city.Ontario is a nice person. This is similar to the program that fills water tanks in sparse areas around the US-Mexico border to aide immigrants or hikers that get lost. There is also an organization that hangs cheese steaks in and around Yo Mama's house. Cuz she gets cranky when she ain't got no cheese steak.As an architect, forget the damn scarf what's that building in the background?!?That's my city! :D Sorry, Ottawa doesn't really make the front page too often. It took a crack head mayor just to get people interested in news from Toronto.Ottawa is probably the nicest city I've ever had the pleasure of visiting.

Love you guys.

Sincerely,

A guy from Washington state who married a Canadian.When I was in Ottawa during winter many years ago, I had lost my gloves. A random stranger noticed I wasn't wearing any, opened up his backpack and took out another pair, took off the warmed up ones he was wearing and gave them to me, putting on the colder ones himself. One of the nicest things I have ever had happen to me.Ottawa resident here, shit's cold. Ottawa's really pretty at night.im from ottawa and i approve this message The other half better be in French. And twice the size.live  in  Ottawa  myself  great  city , metro  pop. of  1.1 million  and  only  8-9  murders  a  year ....some  good  people  live  here...not  me  but  others , kudos  to  these  peopleSo Canadian it hurts. I miss Ontario and its nice people and its colorful money.This is a cool gesture. You can tell someone spent alot of time hand knitting these, which I think make is more special.FUCK YEA OTTAWA REPRESENTAll I can think of is Hermione Granger and house elves. Holy shit. Back in the fall of 2008 when I was on a work term in Ottawa, their bus transit workers went on strike, forcing me to walk 25 minutes to work every day in absolutely bitter conditions. There were times when my knees would get so cold that they would lock up and I would have to duck into an alcove or doorway just to get out of the wind and give them some relief. Anyways, one blustery morning en route to work, an older woman stopped me in my tracks, reached into a tote bag, pulled out this multi-coloured knitted scarf, and handed it to me. Initially I was hesitant as the streets of downtown Ottawa have a lot of homeless people who are not shy of accosting you on the way to work. I told her I did not have any money, but she simply winked at me and continued on down the road. I often re-visit that moment when I'm thinking selfishly. You hear of random acts of kindness all the time but when something like that happens to you it has a profound and lasting impact. I like to think that same lady is the one who is leaving scarfs all around Ottawa in the OP. I hope it brings her much joy.

Tl;dr Lived in Ottawa for four months from Sept-Dec 2008. Transit workers went on strike, forcing many to walk to work in subzero temps. Older lady randomly stopped me and gave me a scarf. This article makes me like to think she's still out there.Ottawa on the front page for the second time in 2014, this was a good year already!/r/ottawa would love this!Haha right on. I saw these while walking home today. Thought it was weird that all the busts had them. I should have stopped to look.My mun, 90+ and blind, knits about two large green garbage bags of scars every year and gives them to the local Ottawa shelters.Typical Canada.

Story about this photo:

> After spending a week photographing various areas of the Canadian Rockies, photographer Brian Donovan decided he wanted to focus on getting some interesting train shots against the wintry backdrop. Dovan shared that over the course of two days he endured nearly 13 hours of sitting by the train tracks, where he saw only 6 trains coming from the wrong (less scenic) direction. As the weather rapidly changed from better to worse a final train came roaring around the bend. Donovan quickly setup and captured the engine as it neared and then adjusted for a long exposure of the boxcars rushing by. The train was loaded with several long segments of different colored boxcars, each giving the shot a unique feel, but the red boxcars instantly stood out, resulting in the amazing image you see here.Why have I never seen this done before? It seems so obvious.  Awesome shot.That is a picture of the flash.Tron TrainI've been there! 
http://i.imgur.com/41g7bsp.jpg
[a wild pokemon has appeared](http://imgur.com/WV7fdSZ)[that's no train](http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120812051806/spongebob/images/3/34/Sandy_spongebob_and_the_worm.jpg)Government coverup. Actually a high-speed photo of the Flash.How come the clouds appear static but the train is moving? Whhat sort of shutter spped do you imagine?Hey y'all. Here's how Brian would have taken this shot:  

First, he had a lens with focal length of about 35mm on full frame. Compare with [this photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/markblumm/10218371523/meta/) taken on a crop sensor which has an effective focal length of about 60mm.

Taking a photo in bright light like this, the camera would be set to ISO100, F/5.6 for good sharpness, and a shutter speed of around 1/1000. But getting good motion blur on a train means a shutter speed of around 5 seconds, like in [this long exposure](http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahbarnes/7282676596/sizes/l/) which I took myself. The difference between 1/1000 and 5 seconds is 12 1/3 stops, but seeing as the foreground is a bit dimmer than the sky Brian probably could have gotten away with a 10 stop Neutral Density filter. 

The photo has also been blended together from two different shots: one of the background with a fast shutter speed, and one of the foreground with a slower shutter speed. The exposures would have been separated just above the top of the train, [like so](http://i.imgur.com/1RlMhtN.jpg). This is particularly obvious because the ND filter has left a purple cast in the foreground of the image. That's not hard to fix, and I'm a bit surprised Brian didn't correct it himself. I did it for him in Photoshop and you can compare the before and after [here](http://i.imgur.com/eZyxLY8.jpg).

TLDR: Focal length 35mm, Background ISO100 F/5.6 1/1000s, Foreground ISO100 F/5.6 5s ND10. There's nothing complicated about even the best photos.

http://i.imgur.com/Q9n9t0m.jpgOn a commercial flight from IL to Canada back in 09 (on my way to AK) we spotted a B-2 headed in the opposite direction while navigating some clouds. It was pretty damn close and banking hard. I'll never forget seeing that thing. When you see it in person it's hard to grasp how it works. Technology is awesome. All I see are a couple of weather balloons. My aunt sent me this picture yesterday. My cousin was flying the fuel plane:

http://imgur.com/FegwxYEFTFY: http://imgur.com/D5JMcbS

Nothing to see here. Carry on.I guess you'd call that a photo-bomber. Notice how the B-2 isn't forming any exhaust contrails while the other aircraft is leaving behind a highly visible contrail from each of its 4 engines. This would give away its position. 

The B-2 can form contrails if the conditions are right, but I'm sure a hell of a lot of engineering went into making sure that this rarely happens.

its like seeing a Ninja in the wild....Where the hell are you?!

http://imgur.com/mFzopNsAirman here, I correctly guessed you lived somewhere in Missouri, those B-2s are stationed out there. The aircraft refueling it is a KC-135 Stratotanker. Pretty common practice but not always visible from the ground so great shot! 
The B-2 is probably on some training mission as pilots need to keep their certifications up frequently, or better yet met be training how to refuel aerially. I don't know whether it's the perspective but I never knew the Stealth Bombers were that big.I love how stealth bombers look like they were photoshopped into real life.Takes me back to Top Gun on NES.

SPEED UP SPEED UP

DOWN DOWNI lived in Missouri near Whiteman AFB.  The stealth bombers flew out of there.  It was always strange to see those things flying so up close. I think the Apache and the Chinook helicopters flew out of there, too.

Also, heard lots of funny and/or cool stories coming out of that area.  

The local BSA troop had connections with Whiteman and got to play after hours in the flight simulators for the Apache.  I was wishing I was a BSA leader that day.

Lots of hunting in MO.  There was a hunter sitting in a patch of brush and trees in the middle of a farmers field.  The Apaches were doing a trial run and the coordinates they were given was that patch of brush and trees.  They flew to the patch and surrounded it, facing inwards, while holding position.  The hunter freaked out, dropped his rifle, and slowly stood up, with his hands up.  He slowly walked out and surrendered.  

Not sure if his pants were clean after that encounter.
Funny thing is OP lives in North KoreaStealth plane, my ass. I can see it right there!

EDIT: wowee, I got gold for this. Thank you, fellow redditor! I finally feel ready to buy that velvet jacket I've been eyeing. Seriously though, much appreciated.

Also, I know stealth planes aren't supposed to be invisible to the eye; twas a silly joke.Oh yeah, I go bird watching with my camera all the time too, it's really convenient because there is a great nesting spot next to a yoga place with huge front glass windows.This is basically the beginning to the movie Executive Decision.B2 Spirit stealth bomber and a KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft.

The KC-135 airframe is *derived* from the old Boeing 707. It has received many advancements over the years. Many of the KCs I have been in were introduced in the 60s and are still in service. The view you get from the boom operator's seat is phenomenal! Can see straight down! I never had the chance to sit and watch an actual air refuel.

Edit: The airframe was *derived* from the 707. I was SF so I only *watched* the A/C.Kurt Russel and John Leguisamo had to catch a plane.

Any of you seen Rambo III?

http://neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=456340


Anyone who has seen this film particularly within the last decade will have probably noticed what seemingly must be a 'strange' attitude towards the Afghan fighters, or specifically the Mujahideen fighting ""the foreign invasion"". This scene encapsulates this point:

Watch

The irony was not lost on the studio/distributor. Here's a quick movia trivia:
The movie ends with two quotes: ""This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan."" and ""I am like a bullet, filled with lead and made to kill"" However, this was a not the original quote in the movie. Prior to the American war in Afghanistan, the ending quote of the movie read **""This film is dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan**"". This was then edited to read ""people of Afghanistan"" during the post 9/11 era.Osama Bin Laden's recruiting organisation for the Mujahedeen (MAK) was funded by Saudi Arabia and Pakinstan (he did not receive funds from Operation Cyclone, the CIA's funding operation for the Mujahedeen) during the Soviet-Afghan War. This actually became the foundation of his funding and recruiting network for Al-Qaeda.

This is 1993, so four years since the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan and three years before his first Fatwa against the United States. The FBI didn't even open a file on him until that Fatwa, and even then they mostly just considered him a potential funder of terrorism. Seems strange to read, but with the information the Independent would have had, they would have little basis to link him to terrorist activities. 

If anyone's interested in finding more about the history of this, I can't recommend Lawrence Wrights 'The Looming Tower' or 'Ghost Wars' by Steve Coll enough. 

EDIT: This was only intended to contextualise the article with a very, very shallow view of the history of this topic. I tried to keep things based in what are 'known knowns', and even then, some would contest me saying Operation Cyclone did not fund Bin Laden. I am not saying what I wrote is definitive, but I hope it provides a little insight. I strongly believe in Chomsky and his 1991 assertion that a decent proportion of 'Terrorology' acts almost as propaganda to maintain the pejorative nature of the term 'terrorism', rather than it being constructive analysis and discussion of the issues we face. I implore anyone who is interested to read on the topic and make up your own mind. There's some very interesting comments in /r/askhistorians around the collapse of the Ottoman Empire onwards and how it's relevant to Middle Eastern politics and the rise of extremism. Remember, Islamic extremism is a relatively new phenomena which, personally, I would date back to the Seige of Mecca in 1979. Again, this depends on your interpretation.


[Yesterdays warriors, todays terrorists.... yesterdays terrorists, todays warrirors](http://newmexicomercury.com/el_macheteMandela-1.gif)Robert Fisk interviewed Osama Bin Laden on three separate occasions. He wrote about them in a wonderful piece from his incredibly fascinating book, ""The Great War for Civilization: The Conquest of the Middle East."" The one thing that will stay with me whenever this sort of stuff is brought up is when the Taliban took Kabul from Massoud in 1996.

There was little mention of it anywhere in the news, the only one BBC reporter via sat phone from Pakistan. Here is a countries capital falling yet no-one even cares to send a news crew.Syria = Afghanistan 2.0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(intelligence)This is a ridiculous equivocation.

When they were fighting in Afghanistan, it was against an invading army, hitting military targets. They weren't going after civilians or anything like that.

""Terrorism"" is making the population fear what you can do and using that fear to accomplish your goals. Once they started attacking civilian targets and using violence to incite fear to affect American foreign policy, *then* they became terrorists. 

tl;dr: Terrorism is about what methods you're using, not what your organization is.Same with the KLA (UCK) in Kosovo, just reversed...Keep this in mind the next time some ass hat lobbies to arm jihadis in Syria [deleted]So are we at war with Eurasia or East Asia?It goes the other way around too. [Here is Menachem Begin wanted by British authorities for blowing up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem](http://i.imgur.com/EmploNm.jpg). He later went on to become Israel's 6th prime minister.http://imgur.com/52Clfw7

This is Danish politician Lars Løkke Rasmussen visiting anti-Soviet heroes in Afghanistan 1988 to personally hand over a large cash donation to them.

He later went on to become the Prime Minister of Denmark  and in charge of the Danish military fighting those same Taliban guys in Afghanistan.

Oh how the times change..I think he's just today's dead guy at the bottom of the ocean. During the anti-Soviet jihad Bin Laden and his fighters received American and Saudi funding. Some analysts believe Bin Laden himself had [security training](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm) from the CIA.

CIA funding flowed to mujahideen via Pakistan, which fanned the flames of militancy to keep its influence in Afghanistan, and also use these elements against its fight with India. 

These very forces were cause celebre to defeat the Russia, but once the funding dried up these elements had nothing to do. The nexus between Pakistan ISI and Taliban is well documented. The handlers ultimately failed to handle these extremists and now the dance with the devil is affecting Pakistan as well, among others.

Highly recommend reading this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Taliban-Militant-Fundamentalism-Central-Edition/dp/0300163681) on Taliban.Link to the article on The Independent's website - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/antisoviet-warrior-puts-his-army-on-the-road-to-peace-the-saudi-businessman-who-recruited-mujahedin-now-uses-them-for-largescale-building-projects-in-sudan-robert-fisk-met-him-in-almatig-1465715.htmlAh, Britain. In March 1993 the New York Times wasn't describing him flatteringly.

>Yemeni officials contend that Afghanistan veterans in Yemen, financed by Osama Binladen [sic], a wealthy Saudi militant and former Afghan guerrilla now living in Khartoum, Sudan, have been behind a series of attacks, including two bombs in Aden hotels last year that killed an Australian tourist.

I had the opportunity to visit the Anne Frank house last year. It was the most reverent place I've ever been. A large rowdy crowd before going in, and instantly quiet and somber once inside. It was an incredible experience. 

Edit: I want to add, the hiding spot was not so much if an attic as we think of it. IIRC, there was a main bedroom, a wide hallway that acted as a bedroom, a bathroom, a large kitchen/dining area, and an attic as we imagine it. The toilet was even plumbed and flushable. I'm not at all trying to say it was a pleasurable place (especially with 8 people), but its interesting to see what it is compared to what is imagined. I simply can't fathom how he must feel returning back to that place.He remarried. I was afraid he would just be lonely and sad.Not to take away from the atrocity, but those are damn high ceilings for an attic.The weight of the world is on his shoulders in that photo. In the photo in his [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Frank), I find the utter sadness in his eyes devastating.I'm currently in Amsterdam and I just visited the museum today. 

You can't leave there without tearing up. The fact that Otto lost his wife and both his daughters and survived the death camps...it's just too much. He made it his life's work to make sure Anne's diary got exposure. 

One of the saddest parts of seeing the house is you see the room Anne lived in and shared. It's tiny. She made it her own by pasting up pictures of her favorite movie stars and clippings. It really hits you that she was just an adolescent kid put in overwhelming circumstances. And the fact that all of this happened less than 70 years ago...it's almost too much for your mind to comprehend and it makes you hate everything the nazis stood for that much more. 

This photo conveys a deep sadness I hope I never have to feel ever in my life. How did she die?Having been there, what a beautiful depiction of the power of that place.  A must see for anyone.The Independent [wrote an article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-things-that-anne-was-really-frank-about-1359567.html) about how Otto had edited Anne's diary before publication.  A new, more complete diary, has recently been released by a surviving relative. No one can rightfully blame a father for wanting his daughter to be percieved as a ""good girl"" by the world. However, one can make the arguement that an honest representation of Anne would reveal a greater truth about the life she led, and would be of greater value as a piece of literature.  What do you think? Is it more important that Anne Frank should be immortalized as a symbol of human determination. Or is her story more valuable as a true representation of one Jewish girl's experience surviving Nazi occupation?

edit: a wordDid the scumbag neighbor ever come forward or were they ever identified? I hope they lived a long and miserable life knowing they killed a child by proxy. I hope their children and grandchildren had to read Frank's diary, then talked shit on the low life piece of shit that turned them in.""One day, Justin Bieber will come here and make all this suffering worthwhile,"" said Otto, lost in thought.Pretty ironic that I'm reading Anne Frank Remembered right now, which is Miep Gies' autobiography explaining what everything was like helping the Franks hide from the Germans. Really interesting book, and I'm glad I picked it for my book report. I personally find it fascinating to think about how this was all so recent. Poor Mr. Frank. :/[deleted]If anyone sees this post and you end up in Amsterdam, go to the Anne Frank museum!!! Ignoring places like the London Natural History Museum (and all natural history museums) it is one of the best museums in the world.

An absolutely fantastic and humbling experience, get in line an hour before it opens though because even at opening time in summer you'll have to wait an hour and half to get in (I learnt the hard way).I had no idea that this picture existed, but it moves me beyond words, especially when I see the height markings the children left on that post.I know this photo. It was shown to us in one of my photo classes back in college. I wish I could remember who took it, but I know it was someone famous. If I remember correctly, they went there to do a portrait and this photo was taken while Otto thought the photographer was setting up. This photo was snapped and the photographer just said ""ok, i'm done"". One frame. simple as that.

I'm sure i'm a little off and maybe someone will correct me or add to the story.This picture makes me weep.  I can't even put my emotions into words.  Some rare pictures of Anne. 

http://imgur.com/a/V6eup#0There is a sadness, and a kind of hollowness in this photo.  But those fuckers didnt kill you, Mr. Frank.  Your name and your line will live on.  You won.I wrote this in 7th grade: 

Ode to Otto

Tough decisions he must make

Peoples' lives in his wake

In hiding, he must

Gain his family's trust

The entire world remembers Anne

But, she didn't know the plan

He was very wise

To have such a disguise

But he was found

His family taken

His daughter killed

But no one now knows the story

The suffering, the sacrifice, and the pain

Of Otto Frank
/r/morbidrealityI am very sorry. Great picture, but i will never understand the phenomena of western people about Anna Frank. 

I invite You to Poland. In every village we should have around 50 of such museums, and in Warsaw a whole district turned into one.

At my parents' house, I always enjoy seeing the hummingbirds fly around. The best is when two or three get into a territory battle over the feeder my mom keeps next to the deck.

""Q. I found a baby bird on the ground. What should I do? I don't want it to die.

A. At some point, nearly everyone who spends time outdoors finds a baby birdone that is unable to fly well and seems lost or abandoned. Our first impulse is to adopt the helpless creature, but this often does more harm than goodand in most cases, the young bird doesn't need our help at all.

The first thing to do is to figure out if it's a nestling or a fledgling. If it's sparsely feathered and not capable of hopping, walking, flitting, or gripping tightly to your finger, it's a nestling. If so, the nest is almost certainly nearby. If you can find the nest (it may be well hidden), put the bird back as quickly as possible. Don't worryparent birds do not recognize their young by smell!

If the bird is feathered and capable of hopping or flitting, and its toes can tightly grip your finger or a twig, it's a fledgling. Fledglings are generally adorable, fluffy, with a tiny stub of a tail. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that the bird has been abandoned and needs you. But fledglings need a special diet, and they need to learn about behavior and vocalizations from their parentsthings we can't provide. 

Fortunately, the vast majority of ""abandoned"" baby birds are perfectly healthy fledglings. Their parents are nearby and watching out for them. The parents may be attending to four or five young scattered in different directions, but they will most likely return to care for the one you have found shortly after you leave.

When fledglings leave their nest they rarely return, so even if you see the nest it's not a good idea to put the bird back init will hop right back out. Usually there is no reason to intervene at all beyond putting the bird on a nearby perch out of harm's way. Fledglings produce sounds that their parents recognize, and one of them will return and care for it after you leave.

If you have found both parents dead or are otherwise absolutely certain that the bird was orphaned, then your best course of action is to bring it to a wildlife rehabilitator. A sick, injured or orphaned baby bird may need emergency care until you can get it to a wildlife rehabilitator."" -

Translated excerpts from [Norwegian national broadcaster NRK](http://www.nrk.no/ho/_-verdens-eldste-revolver-1.11628328) (article with film clip):

The revolver started its history at a weaponsmith's in Nürnberg, Germany. The year was 1597. Once it was a status symbol, with its decorations in brass, bone and mother-of-pearl. More than 400 years later it is well preserved in a cellar in Lillehammer, Norway.

- The reason we know it's from 1597 is because it has a mark in shape of a horse spur. This tells us with certainty that it is made of the German weaponsmith Hans Stopler, director Gaute Jacobsen of the Maihaugen collections says.

The revolver has belonged to the German Georg von Reichswein. He was a proffessional soldier and fought on the Danish-Norwegian side in the 30-year war (1618-1648).

- We are not quite sure wether he had the revolver when he came to Norway in 1628 or wether he bought it in Bergen in 1636, Jacobsen states.

Which begs the question: When forming the Second Amendment were the Forefathers so ignorant of how technology was rapidly changing and advancing as some would suggest?  I would say, no.

Did it fire similar to todays pin fired cartridges?

Looks like you place a paper cartridge and a pellet in each chamber, then to fire, you rotate to a loaded chamber, slide back the lid, fill the pan with gun powder then pull the trigger.

If that's how it fired, I wonder how possible that a spark could ignite all chambers at once.See that knob on the end? That's for caving in skulls Is the ball on the end used as a counter weight or just a bludgeon?Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable.

That's something to think about.That's still 2 more shark-related deaths than we had in Canada.To give you some background this picture was taken in Perth as one of many protests which occured all over Australia to protest the culling of sharks in Australia for safety. Perth in particular wants to use baited nets to lure and catch and kill sharks close to swimming beaches. Many believe this will kill not only large (possibly dangerous) sharks but also smaller sharks that pose no threat to people.Plot Twist: Obesity is the nickname of a freakishly large shark that terrorises beach goers nation wide.[deleted]I'll deal with the sharks if it means not having to use a spatula and warm water to get my balls un-frozen from my car seat.> Skin Cancer: 2000

I think this means you're safer in the water than on the beach.I don't fear dying from a shark attack, I fear being awake and alive with a shredded appendage on a sandy beach.Just playing devil's advocate here but what is difference in the percentage of people that expose themselves to sharks (entering the ocean) to people that expose themselves to things such as cancer (breathing)?CULL THE LIGHTNINGI've always found it interesting that prostate, colonic and lung cancers kill more people that breast cancer each year but they never seem to make these lists.

Stupid people will always need other people to think for them and lack basic common sense.  
Getting into the ocean where these animals live and feed to survive is a necessary risk that every sane person here accepts. It'd be like going on safari dressed like an antelope and then complaining when too many people are getting attacked by lions.  
There's a lot of ""hypothesis"" bandied around about why attacks are apparently increasing, but the simple truth is there's less food for the seals, seals come closer to shore to feed, sharks love a good fatty seal and mistakenly have a nibble on something wearing a wetsuit. I thought it was a huge sign in the sand until i scrolled down and saw the hand - that's actually a very tiny sign!It's no wonder only 2 people died from drinking energy drinks. You have to drink *way* too much for it to kill you.I live in one of the towns were somebody was killed by a shark in 2013. It was really sad, he was just a teenager bodyboarding one day and attacked at one of the safest beaches in the area. His friends had to pull his body out of the water (very brave of them in blood-filled waters) but he was dead before the ambulance got there. 

I work in menswear and the boys mother came in to choose a suit for her son's funeral. She was so devastated and you could tell that she hadn't been able to accept her son's death. She seemed so out of it, walking around in a daze and telling herself ""he would have liked this one "" as she paid for the suit.

While there are few shark attacks in Australia, they are still a tragedy and can affect a whole community like in the case of this attack.Well this is only deaths, you're leaving out attacks. Oh and it looks like the chick in the dark skirt left of the sign has her tits flopping outWithout considering the risk of danger of a certain activity, these numbers are meaningless. More people died from lightning than Russian roulette last year!I wish the topless girl to the left would turn around.I like how Australian dies in even numbers.

Great to see it from this perspective. I've been there with my (then) girlfriend. We wanted to go up this very mountain, but hadn't considered the fact that we had to cross several streams, so in the end, we didn't go.

Behind the highest climber runs a river, which streams past the camping place that lies at the foot of the smaller hill on his right. The black field below his feet is is filled with huge blocks of obsidian. With a bit of sunshine these blocks look stunning, as the black stone contains all sorts of colours, like a rainbow.
There's a trail that leads of to the left, past the foot of the hill, to the Brennisteinslada, a volcano, which has some crazy fumeroles, creating a faerie-like landscape. The mountains here have all sorts of minerals in them, which makes the slopes surprisingly beautiful and colourful. This is especially visible from the mountain in the centre of the picture, of which I forgot the name.

Edit: oh, and the small river (runs next to the campsite) that is heated by means of geothermal energy is fantastic. In my experience the weather was hardly ever as nice as this. In fact it was grey and cold most of the time. Sitting all alone (go early) in a heated river, rain pouring down on you, surrounded by some of the most amazing natural scenery - this is perhaps one of my happiest memories ever.Bullshit, I've logged 1200 hours on Skyrim, I know the planes of Whiterun when I see them.Is that Spiderman?I lived in Iceland for a year.

Said he was the real deal and just about the nicest guy  ever met. One of my prized possessions is a signed copy of one of his books that my Uncle asked him for specifically for me.

Mr Carter and I likely disagree on a few items, but he's a good man.He looks like a young Sci-Fi actor who has been artificially aged using prosthetics.Jimmy created both the Department of Energy and Department of Education. He tried to convert us to the metric system. Since retiring he has worked tirelessly as a humanitarian. He is perhaps the most ethical person to have ever held the Presidential Office, and continues to serve his nation and humanity just because it is the right thing to do. God bless him. We were all Republican voters in Alabama.  That's why it surprised me about 12 years ago when my mother-in-law gave me Jimmy Carter's book about his childhood, ""An Hour Before Daybreak"" as a Christmas Gift. I read it.  I told her later that it turned out to be one of the best gifts I've ever been given. A surprise, and a treasure.

I could not wait to vote against that redneck peanut farmer when I was a prick of a young man, 19 in 1976, and I voted for the incumbent, Gerald R. Ford that year.

It was one of the worst decisions I ever made. My own mother, incidentally, supported Jimmy Carter, against the wishes of my father. I remember her insisting that we should turn our thermostat down to 68 degrees and wear sweaters and sock in the house because ""the President has asked us to sacrifice because there is an energy crisis.""

And I laughed at her, and I laughed at President Carter.

I was only a kid.  I am no longer that kid.  Jimmy Carter was the ONLY principled US President of my lifetime.

Jimmy made a very good one.

Goddamn I love that man! I hate that things truly beyond his control (runaway inflation and Iran crisis) have been turned into the things that defined his presidency instead of admiring his struggle to do the right thing in spite of the potential political fallout.  As a lame a president he was, this man really is a good human being. Even as the OPEC imposed embargo, and the US hit severely by it as well as its own peak in production of oil, he had these words to say,

It's my *crowning* achievement in my short bird-watching career. *Friendly* purple crowned fairy wrens, too.[Quick bit of art. Pretty colors.](http://i.imgur.com/F410qa2.png)Damn son they must have really worked on opening their crown chakra to get a sweet ass tat like that from mother nature.Do they get along with Rainbow Lorikeets?

I say this because it looks similar to colors in other species that I know for a fact are structural.

Canada has more square meters awesome than any other country!BAMF MountainAmerican from Chicago here, visited Banff this last summer and loved it. Seeing how we don't even have hills where I live this scenery was out of this world for me. My friend from Calgary took me here to go up Sulfur mountain and it was well worth it. If you have the time and are capable I would recommend hiking up the mountain instead of taking the cable cars. I was pretty hungover when I did this but still enjoyed the hike up. As for the town itself it was a little touristy but I didn't think it was that bad as some of the other posters are saying, maybe that was because I wasn't there during ski season though.Ah, the mountains of the STD.
Glorious BanffFuck, I thought I had it good with Colorado's Rockies.That is banff. Its a little bridge and behind it is the fairmont. Been there tons of times! Its beautiful! I will always remember that bridge as the place where, when arriving in town, I pulled up next to a transit bus that had been vinyl-wrapped with wildlife pictures of elk, one of which was right next to my passenger window and had on display a larger-than-life set of elk testicles so close that my wife could almost reach out and stroke them. I have a picture somewhere...This is only an hour and a half from here and I haven't been in a few months now. It's funny how something can be so much less exciting when you live nearby.I was in Banff two summers ago.  It was amazing, and I loved running there.  I ran across that bridge multiple times.

While it is a good distance away from Banff, go to Moraine Lake.  Most beautiful place I have ever seen.Hey is there good skiing there? Fuck it I might just move there for a season, and go skiing everyday. So beautiful[And here's the view if you turn to your left [OC]](http://imgur.com/P88N9bt)BANFF!

Everyone in the film had some grand learning experience. Coach Irving reinvigorated his passion in the sport after years of absense, Derice learns the skill of leadership and representing his country rather than copying the professionals, Yul learns to be a team player, and Junior learns to stand up to his dad and be a man. But Sanka doesn't go through any significant change, he doesn't even learn how to deal with the cold. But that doesn't matter, because he's the rock that doesn't change, and he carries an unbroken Jamaican spirit with him, which everyone else forgot about, which was ultimately the key to their performance. Sanka is the real hero of the movie, and I think from this we can learn a lot about pride in our identity and walking into the unknown waving your banners high.

Reddit has a thriving community of Bonsai growers and aficionados, who are quite willing to answer your questions regarding Wisteria and all sorts of other trees that are often used for bonsai.

Come say hello. Check out the sidebar for an insane amount of information.I want this more than is healthy.Lets get under that Tree of Souls and connect nervous systems. It's a good thing to bonsai wisteria  because that shit will take over everything if you let it.Aww. A weesteria.Finally!  Someone has cut-back a Wisteria plant often enough to break its spirit and stop it spreading like a wildfire.  

Non-bonsai Wysteria can take over your whole house.  I wouldn't let it near my place.I imagine this is where the fairies live.The only sane way to deal with Wisteria is fire.  That plant is the devil.Can these grow indoors?OP made the dangerous descent into the Devil's Cauldron in order to dig up this rare tree in hopes of selling it in order to finance a large supply of counterfeit bonsai trees for his local bonsai tree shop. Unfortunately, before he could get the tree and climb out, OP's climbing ropes were stolen by Terry Silver's band of hooligans, and the only way he could get them back was to sign up for the All-Valley Karate Tournament. Long story short, the tree turned out to have zero monetary value, and now resides in OP's grandmother's sun room. OP's grandmother happened to send this lovely photo to OP in a thank you/get well soon card while OP was in the hospital recovering from getting his ass beat in the tournament. It looks like a flower breathing wood dragon.I live in gardening zone 4b so this is not going to grow outdoors, however I've been thinking about getting a bonsai wisteria for indoors.  My best light is west facing.  Can anyone speak to wisteria as a houseplant? 
Also, I'm a bit disheartened by the guy saying it only blooms for a week.  Can anyone recommend a great blooming tree for indoor bonsai?
Thanks redditSaw one like this at the Cherry Blossom festival in San Francisco two years ago. It was over 80 years old and originally belonged to a lady who got the seedling kit for her birthday from her granddaughter and had cared for it for years with no blossoms.  When grandma passed away, the family went to clean out her apartment and the tree had finally blossomed.  I know I'm not doing the story justice, but very cool lineage and to see something that had been cared for so lovingly for so long was fascinating.[deleted]how big do these suckers get?  like will it say an inside plant or will you need to move it outisde?Wow that's beautiful I was going to get one of these bonsai flower trees for my wife for valentines day, but was afraid it wouldn't be in bloom, and therefore wouldn't look all the special.

Just let the stuff melt, you're gonna have to warm up the car anyway, right?

I'd think especially with electric windows the gaskets for them would be nice and shrunk and rolling it down would cause those to stick, and burn up or put excess wear on the motors in the doors....wait..does your normal way of opening windows involve punching through them? ...are you liam neeson?This looks cool when you [stereoscope](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3KWyz.png) itJust out of curiosity for anyone that's done this. If I applied a liberal coat of RainX to the window before the storm, would: a)ice even be able to form or would the water roll off before it froze?

That's your first problem, right there: you're driving in the ditch. [deleted]Can confirm: as a fellow Alabamian, it is a living hell on the roads right now Today I learned I LOVE being called a ""Northman"". Makes me want to go chop down a tree, build a house with it and many of it's brethren and live in the woods.I've been driving in that shit for 30+ years without crashing yet.   

My secret:  The first day it snows, don't drive, no matter what.  This helps sort out all the non-experienced drivers.  They all end up like the people in the picture.  Stuck to each other, or stuck in ditches.  I call this the Seasonal Culling.

Next up is technique.  Slow down.  A lot.  No, seriously.  At every intersection, whether you have the right-of-way or not, you need to be prepared to stop.  Many motorists have no clue about physics but drive their cars on the threshold of traction all day long.  These people will slide through red lights and stop signs.  Repeatedly too, I might add.  All the way home, or until they crash.

Driving in adverse conditions amplifies bad driving habits, like failing to use turn signal indicators.  People who get away with misusing them on dry pavement end up causing collisions in bad weather.  Following too closely - not good.  Speeding - nope.  These are the Big Three offenses, and they are all deadly in the snow.

Buy a dash cam.  Worth their weight in gold.You french-fried when you should've pizza'dI just posted this on some pics from /r/WTF:
You have no idea. I was in an ambulance that has been hit over 20 times. Another ambulance down the road from me got hit 5 times, then caught fire. After we got the fire out, it got hit at least 8 more times (estimated by the crew) we just got back to our base which is 40 miles from Birmingham, and it took us 9 hours. There are literally people getting out and leaving their vehicles on one of the interstates. It reminds me of an episode of The Walking Dead.I'm from Boston, went to school in Atlanta, and am here on a recruiting trip.  The main problem is that Atlanta and other southern cities don't have the equipment to salt/sand the roads.  So even if it's half an inch of snow, if it gets packed down by cars and freezes, then it's very difficult to drive on.  It's rarely the snow that's the problem.  It's the aftermath of the snow being driven on that's difficult.


The second problem is that most of the cars here don't have the proper tires.  When I lived in Atlanta for college and had my tires changed, I could only find ""summer"" tires, aka non all season tires.  The summer tires perform better than all season tires in almost all cases, except when the roads are slippery which isn't much of a concern in the south.


Lastly, the lack of experience completes the trifecta.  People don't know how to properly slow down to a stop instead of hitting the brakes when it's already too late.  You have to basically hit the gas with a lot of caution and ideally stop by rolling into it.  A combination of people who drive too fast and cause accidents and people who drive too slow thinking they will cause an accident results in the gridlock all over Atlanta.


TL;DR; No salt/sand + no all season tires + no experience = the hell that Atlanta is in right now.To be fair.. That's a bitchin hill.  We use winter tires in the winter, that's how[deleted]In Finland it's mandatory to take ""slippery"" track courses when going for a license. If you're doing the testing while summer then we have special tracks that have been oiled to simulate winter environment.

Also it's mandatory to change between summer and anti-skid tyres every year. Reasoning behind this is that summer tyres do not wear out the asphalt as fast as anti-skid (winter) tyres would, but they are too unsafe (due to lack of friction) to be used on ice.

Sorry for sloppy english, ain't my native language obviously :)Okay, this is going to be burried but here are my tips for driving safe in the snow, from a North-East Ohioan who lives in the snow belt.

1.Drive about 10mph less than the speed limit.

2.Never slam on the breaks. NEVER. If you think you are going to hit someone just let the car slid into them, slamming on the breaks will just make you spin out. You're still going to hit them and now someone might hit you.

3.When going down a hill don't touch anything. Don't hit the gas, don't hit the break unless you see someone doing something fucked up ahead of you.

4.When going up a hill, as you are at the bottom, hit the gas and keep that momentum all the way up the hill. If you stop on the hill or slow down to much you will be fucked. If you have to stop at the bottom of the hill and wait for it to be clear before starting up it. This might make the people behind you angry. They will probably crash and you'll be fine.

5.Always carry a gallon of gas, some kitty-litter/sand/Cement-Mix, a flash light, jumper cables, some snacks and a blanket.

6.Only get out of your car if you are actively doing something. If you are just standing around get back in the car, both for warmth and so you don't get hit when the next person spins out.

7.If your car doesn't have Anti-Lock Breaks(and sometimes even if it does) pump the breaks(Quickly and lightly pushing) instead of just hitting them.

8.Use some god damn common sense! I fucking saw a lady talking on her phone while driving an SUV while it was blizzarding out!

9.Assume the other driver is actively trying to kill you. Do anything you can to avoid them, stay as far away as you can, and watch them as much as you can. Seeing how there cars are doing is a much better indicator of what you might be about to hit then just looking at the road itself.

Well those are my tips. Hopefully some of you will read this and use it to not fucking die.As a northman, I can say the same about the heat down thereFrom New Jersey, live in Los Angeles. It's funny how that works. When it rains out here people drive like when it snows back east. But when there was that random east coast earthquake people lost their minds. In LA people get in to work and are like ""You feel that earthquake last night?"" ""Yep."" 

It's just what you're used to. I hear people in Seattle don't really use umbrellas. [We had 300+ crashes reported in Central Texas this morning.](http://www.kvue.com/news/local/EMS-reporting-crashes-in-Northwest-Austin-242369251.html) There was no snow at all, just icy roads. Gas pedal and don't slam your breaks ease off your gas well in advance and you should do fineSome advice from a Swiss.

* Winter tires as soon as temperature stays under 10°C (you make the conversion if needed.)

* Keep larger security distance with the car in front.

* Anticipate any braking or turning at least two times of what you do on dry road.

* Don't make any harsh movement especially with the driving wheel.

* Accelerate very slowly, even more if your car is RWD.

* On the snow, 4x4 accelerate better but doesn't brake better!

* With a RWD car you might want to add some weight (like 100 lbs) in the trunk to have a better grip.

* Be patient, put some relaxing music while you drive.

Spread the word, knowledge is power and most of all: Take care!

Edit: 10°C = 50°F.
Edit 2: Under 45°F, normal (summer) tyres lose all adherence even on dry road! Again, it's not the snow that should make you change tyres, it's the temperature.No one handles ice very well.  Most other places have salt/sand trucks to  make the roads safer.Take the route that doesn't involve hills. Or at the very least, go slower than parking garage speed when on them.Meanwhile this was posted in /r/Finland

 http://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1wavf3/just_some_winter_driving_in_finland/its more of not proper equipped, up here in NH we get snow tires.  Town have machines to take care of the road, sanders, slat, plows etc. What happens when a million people all realize at once they have been driving on bald tires for 5 yearsI'm stuck in this, still. People are being extremely calm, helpful, and patient like only people in Alabama can be.  The problem is ZERO salt, ZERO sand, ZERO pretreat, ZERO access for our one snow plow due to gridlock, ZERO preparedness by the DOT.  The storm wasn't expected to come to Birmingham so all businesses and schools were open.

He was described as having an elongated face, a bare forehead, blue eyes, eagle-like nose, small mouth, a chin with dimples, chestnut hair and eyebrowes, a face with redness. His tall stature - 1.79m, 5.87 feet - makes him a good recruit for this exceptional army corpse. 

>During the spring of 1815, Napoleon leaves the island of Elbe and meets his enemies in Belgium, with a hastily drafted army. 

>One month after his drafting, the 18th of june, young Feauveau takes part in the desperate charge of the carabiniers towards the end of the battle [of Waterloo]. He certainly was struck during this charge by a cannonball in the chest. 

>The breastplate is one of the main masterworks of the Army Museum since its founding, but it may still not have told everything. Indeed, another Feauveau - his brother - might have substituded to François-Antoine, who was soon to get married. And that anonymous would have been the one to die during the last heroic charge of the Emperor's carabiniers. 


TL;DR: No, he did not survive. But there is a doubt about the exact identity of the breastplate's owner.'Anyone got any cannonball wound ointment?'So did he survive?That guy is so incredibly deadWalk it offthe blood and guts appear to have washed off well.I did a little googling.  Cuirasse translates to chest plate armor, carabinier describes the type of soldier, a rifleman equipped with a type of carbine - often on horseback.  That was it originally but then the name started to get used for all sorts of elite rifleman groups.

In this context (napoleonic wars) it was the latter, an elite group of riflemen with red combs on their helmets.  This particular chap seems to have suffered a nasty boo-boo.This kills the human.Holey shit!would this have been a nice quick/instant death for the guy? I assume it would be, but im no expert.

But with a projection you as stuck with what is displayed and you can't see that little bit extra.

However, I prefer to sit in the middle aisle, so it won't effect me. Oh and the fact that this is for private jets, so I wouldn't even be that close in the first place!Blaine is a pain, and that is the truth.Im so glad for the rich.According to [here](http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/273034.htm) (via Google translate):

Spike Aerospace company is building the world's first supersonic private jet. This model is expected to be S-512 aircraft for the December 2018 debut, priced up to $ 80 million. The biggest difference between the S-512 airliner with common though is that it took a windowless fuselage, there is a whole perspective of ""windows.""

This company is headquartered in Boston, the latest video recording, broadcast, streaming media and high-definition display technology used in the screen, as an alternative to conventional aircraft windows. Video by an external body covered with S-512 mini camera shot, then spread inside the fuselage bending the screen, thus forming a complete external video images. If passengers want to sleep or not to disturb the clouds outside, you can choose to dim the screen or control the display of other different environmental image.

While this ""window"" can ease claustrophobia, but first have a reasonable engineering solutions to ensure the stability of the fuselage structure. Want solid body, it is necessary to solve the problem of the windows, so that the aircraft carrying military personnel and materiel have taken a windowless structure. For those of ordinary passenger window, in order to altitude at 35,000 feet at a speed of 500 mph while flying body will not crack, and in order to maintain the stability of cabin pressure, they also took the oval, small panes and double pane design.
Window can have fewer airplanes easier, safer and more streamlined structure, but passengers have become accustomed to looking out at the time of takeoff and landing landscape. Spike Aerospace said that according to a pre-conceived from the beginning they put S-512 is designed to windowless structure. Company founder Vic Calcutta Leah (Vik Kachoria) told the ""Connection"": ""Several advisers and friends, and I said, no windows and how the plane trip to the passengers but I think if the big screen, giving them vision? may be able to solve this problem. ""

This approach solves the problem of aircraft resistance and body weight windowed case. S-512's maximum speed of 13.7 mph (Mach 1.8), can take up to 18 passengers.
So when will someone put porn on the windows while flying on autopilot?Ever flown private? It's the best goddamn thing ever. EVER. Nice, so if the plane is crashing they can just display a completly different image on the screen so noone panics while they're dying.I can honestly say this will never affect my life, not even once.[This won't be intimidating at all...](http://i.imgur.com/slduUvN.jpg)Why is this terrifying to meDont know if this will get buried, but it is not the first supersonic business jet to be conceptualized. 

[SAI and Lockheed Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAI_Quiet_Supersonic_Transport) teemed up to create one that **DOESNT PRODUCE A SONIC BOOM**. Like blaine the mono.

It should be awesome when we get it!Now you too can watch the sky go by in glorious 320x17000 resolution, with a blinding backlight that you can't dim and a display you can't turn off!

Talk about a migraine plane. Why are people freaking out about the displays operating system failing? Are they worried they wont get their outside fix, or do they think that the displays failing will mean the entire plane will fail?

Do they not realize planes have been all but controlled by computers for many years now?Let me guess, the plane is called Blaine.How cool would it be to have a fake exterior rendered for you, like the view from the IIS, the view out a train window, or under the ocean?Man, I wish I was rich.

It's beautiful. And on another note this is the closest thing I can relate to the colors you see while on acid. [Needs more color saturation.](http://i.imgur.com/xXS5WPe.jpg)As an Iranian, it warms my heart to see such positive and beautiful discussion and praise here. Aside from all the politics and all the warm-mongering, this really goes to show that our people are much alike with very similar interests; all the hatred and propaganda we see on both our medias really does not reflect the bigger picture. We are a loving people with a rich and deep-rooted history of humanitarianism and compassion. From the creation of Cyrus's Cylinder which is commonly noted as the origin of human rights, we wish the best for all of humanity. Our leaders may not make it seem so, but that is because in the face of aggression it would ache all of us to appear subservient and weak. It is once again, nice to see my country's name being mentioned on a public forum without a barrage of political-driven criticism and hatred. Thank you, all you wonderful people. Makes me think of back when I was visiting Jerusalem, I was able to visit the dome of the rock.  I've always found muslim architecture and aesthetics quite interesting. From my cultural background, it feels engaging but different enough to make me feel I don't quite get it.

This is gorgeous. Thanks for sharing.  One does not have to be religious to appreciate good architecture.
It's truly amazing what people have the capability to make when they put their mind to it.
I see all the trash and garbage we place on this earth, and it does my heart good to see beautiful buildings.  Whether it be a cathedral, a mosque, or just the building meant to appreciated.  The work and time it goes into some of these buildings really makes me appreciate what we can put on earth.This is the Nasir al-Mulk Mosque in Shiraz I think... I have tons of (not HQ) pics from when I was there a while back... the amount of detailed ceramic work on the exterior is [insane](http://i.imgur.com/M5ieUmD.jpg).

What I found coolest though, and recommended to anyone who visits... was the alley behind the place. It's some random little alley between the mosque and the market (Vakil market) and it has [awesome symmetry](http://i.imgur.com/G11SSrI.jpg).

Edit: Oops my pictures are from another mosque in the same city- **Vakil mosque**!Mosques are so beautiful inside! [This is one I saw on Reddit a while ago.

While interior shots can be improved nicely with HDR, there's absolutely no reason to run wild with the saturation like that.

I'd like to see what this, you know, actually looks likeSay what you want about religion, but some awesome art, music, and architecture come about as a result of it.  I suppose you don't need religion for those things, but for all you religious people, here's an atheist saying something good about it.

I think she'll know.That white rabbit would give me nightmares. The rabbits name is Tim.  Dunno who the cat is.  He's has to be a bad ass if he's hanging out with the likes of Tim.  I wouldn't recommend going outside right now.Neutral ground is best when making a truce. If he offers you something to eat or drink, take it!  I hear things get trippy after that!These giant flesh eating rabbits are best to be avoided all together. One killed my brother just three months ago. Looks like you don't own a lawnmower eitherThe keys! The keys! I had left them in the lock. Dangling, taunting me just out of reach. I would have to move quickly if I was to go unnoticed. Too late! The white rabbit's eyes found me. I was frozen by his gaze. I would soon be no more. A light prayer escaped my lips, ""Please God...""That's some Watership Down shit going down there.There's a good chance this is a domesticated rabbit that was either ""freed"" or escaped. 

If you or anyone sees an unusually friendly rabbit or a rabbit that sticks out like a sore thumb, please secure it and bring it to the nearest shelter immediately. A domesticated rabbit in the wild will die a horrible horrible death. I love that you put the baby at the window to see!Is that Frank?Maybe you didn't before, but you do meow!Garden?It's the Easter bunny. You shouldn't have made fun of Easter last year...Um its looking like your about to not own a dead rabbit

Incredible. It would blow my mind if I saw that through a telescope. I'm a little wary of these pictures.

Best just ignore it.You know, when you snapped this picture, you were looking at Saturn where it was 68-84 minutes ago.I read this as ""I took a picture of Satan through my telescope"" and instantly clicked.  What does that say about me?What is the farthest planet you can see clearly? Can you see Uranus?I know Saturn is far away (really) and I'm not knowledgeable in size and scope of some things in the cosmos. 

But from this angle of the picture and zooming in, it looks as if Saturn is either really really close to us OR it's freaking tremendously huge.Mind if I ask what telescope you took this picture with and how much it costs? What would happen if you aimed it at the moon or even mars which are so much closer?  I didnt realize it was  possible to see saturn so distinctly like this without a HUGE type of telescope It's no hubble picture but for a backyard set up its pretty fucking good. Great job I like it.What is the scope that you used?

Aperture size?

Focal length?

Eyepiece size?

Barlow lenses?Space jamCool!!!As close as Mars is to Earth right now, you should take a pic and post it next!I got this last night through my friends telescope, Jupiter and three moons taken with 5s

It is basically a heavily modified Combat Vehicle 90 (Swedish IFV).

Most of todays Main Battle Tanks were designed in the 70s and finished at the start of the 80's (most famously T-72, M1 Abrams, and Leopard 2). These platforms were so good that their upgraded versions are still dominant forces - Leopard 2A6, T-90, M1A2. They are all very versatile and well designed platforms so the drawbacks of simply having them upgraded over and over aren't big if anything.

So, what are important features of a tank?

* Mobility - at 70-90 km/h top speed and decent fnough acceleration, the traditional MBTs do really well there for heavy tracked vehicles.

* Armour - the old models are so adaptable in terms of armour that they are always up to date in protection. Not a single Abrams or Leopard has been taken out by enemy fire in Afghanistan or Iraq, despite countless RPGs fired at them. They are also quite mine safe, these days even huge IEDs usually only injure and not kill a few crew members and leave the tank repairable.

* Gun - Smoothbore guns, 120mm for western or 125mm for Russian/Chinese tanks. Some use 105mm rifled guns. Not many differences there. PL-01 would use a 120mm smoothbore, perfectly normal.

* Maintance and supply - as heavy tracked vehicles, they need A LOT if maintance and fuel. The PL-01 could be a bit more efficient there, but generally the current MBTs do well already (only Abrams lacks a bit).

* Electronics and optics - crucial, but not too reliant on the chassis.

The real new features of PL-01 will be reduced radar and heat signatures. In return the tracks seem hard to access to me, making track maintance (a crucial task) rather difficult. It only weights **30-40 tons* however, which is way lighter than Leo 2 or Abrams (60-70 tons)! The question there is, how the armour compares then. It will have only ~920 hp compared to the 1500 of current western tanks, yet achieves roughly the same speed.

It will probably be more important due to its versatility - its somewhere between an MBT and an IFV!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL-01I think someone played too much [Battlezone](http://i.imgur.com/KqUDhZm.gif?1) when they were younger.Ugh.

Kid on the left carry a sack with Rojolele written on it. Rojolele is a popular variety of rice in Indonesia.

The licence plate on the car has typical Indonesian format. 

The blue car on the back is probably angkot (angkutan kota), a form of public transportation usually a converted minivan.
I don't know why, but the difference in footwear really sticks out to me.Pretty sure those kids just work the night shifts.
This is in INDONESIA not the Philippines. Look at the brown uniform worn by the school kids, it's a uniform of Pramuka (Indonesian boy scout).As someone who grew up in the Philippines, wtf! Public schools are free, unless that changed. 

Unless, those kids have afternoon class and they are just strolling with there friends. The bare foot part, I had friends who walked with their bare feet so sometimes I tend to take off my flip-flops and walk bare footed with them. That's so sadCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I think it's in Indonesia. The uniforms of the schoolkids look like Indonesian grade schoolers on Friday, which they wear the brown 'pramuka' uniforms, since it's mandatory in state schools have scout activities on a Friday. Plus, the car license plates look like Indonesian ones from far away.The fact the working boys don't have shoes makes me sad.ITT: People caring more about which country rather than social issues. I work with a non-profit that helps support the families of children like these so they can go to school instead of having to work.

As people say, this is Indonesia though I've seen the same thing in the Philippines, especially in my last visit. There were multiple families that had babies and young children literally living on the edge/inside a trash dump. As in trucks and heavy machinery were piling trash into a landfill/dump a stone's throw away from theirs make shift trash-made huts. Incredibly sad.I've been to the Philippines several times and it's truly heart breaking to see things like this. My fiance is from there and would have been in the same position if it wasn't for his older sisters working at a young age so their younger brothers could go to school.  Sometimes I wish the United States  would have made the Philippines a state when it one of our territories.  That's sad. I saw that in India. I always feel bad and wish I could have helped more. The orphanage I stayed at treated me better then any other place I've stayed. I gave them roughly $500 to help them and it took everything I could do to make them keep it. If I ever win the lottery that's the first place getting an upgrade.Sure *this* is beautiful, but when *I* try photographing little boys at the playground the police are all over me.For what it's worth, the Gini coefficient of the Philippines is nearly identical to that of the United States. That is, the measure of income distribution among the population. Not to imply that the poorest or wealthiest in the Philippines are tantamount to the same in the US, but I think it's food for thought.

Great moment caught on camera. Good job, cameraman.It just occurred to me that ""schoolboy"" (or ""school boy"") has a potentially different meaning, depending on your perspective.  I have just always thought of it as a boy who goes to school, because he is that age.

But I was thinking about the way those boys might talk to each other, when they talk ABOUT the other boys.  How the school boys might actually refer to the other boys as ""work boys,"" and how the ""work boys"" might refer to ""school boys"".

It's sad that there is such a big difference between these boys from the very beginning.   Say what you want about the US education system.  I certainly criticize it plenty.

He's at Valley of the Kings Sanctuary and Retreat, in Sharon, WI. There are fifty exotic cats. All came from abuse, neglect, seized, or just surrendered from all over the country (and they get a call a week to take in more).

Obie is still alive and well, he is spoiled like a child. Who you have to keep in a cage. Bad analogy. He's treated like young Buddha. Since he was hand-raised by so many people, he gets a 20 pound meat-cake on HIS birthday with fat frosting, stuffed animals (buttons removed) to carry around, and is generally a content tiger.

The biggest danger with Obie would likely being played-with-to-death or being layed upon, so no one goes in with him.

The drug dealer also had a mountain lion kept in a 6 foot by 6 foot by 6 foot dog kennel in his basement. DEA was shutting him down, but learned he was getting a tiger cub. They arranged with the sanctuary to make sure we had room for after the raid.

He was tired and scared and hungry, but adapted very well. The cats, not the drug dealer. Then again, the dealer was likely scared and hungry in prison, but honestly, I hope he did not adapt well at all.

The mountain lion is still alive. He spends his days in a HUGE cage, out in the sunshine or hiding inside from people. He hates people. No worries, he gets fed to contented obesity and left alone.

Fortunately, rules have changed for the better regarding inter-state transport of exotic cats, and distances that have to be kept by the public. I'm his veterinarian, so I can get closer than the public is allowed. The pic of him being fed chicken is the owner of the sanctuary.

He is a gigantic orange ball of deadly love.

Seriously, you can die and shit.Reminds me of the cave they found in 127 Hours.Plot twist: it's a waste water reservoir for a nearby chemical treatment facility.dolphin rape cave..Is your buddy named Ted by chance?He is totally going to have to cut off his own arm by the end of tomorrow. An old lava flow tunnel I also swim when I hike.sea side caves can be very dangerous with out local knowledge of tides and shit I want to create a law of the internet, where any picture posted to reddit  of something cool will have about 1/3 of the comments talking about why this is dangerous in some obscure way. I just don't know what to call it.

It's a cool little cave. People are saying it's dangerous because of tides. OK, if you camp out in there maybe. How quickly do you think tides come in, people? Hell, you can even see the water line to see how high the water would go. The cave won't magically fill in 10 seconds. I'm always finding hidden underground cave systems when I go hiking near my home .......Let's pray that it wasn't a limestone cave. That stuff dissolves in the water, and if you swallow any of it you get to experience Mount Vesuvius, only instead of a mountain it's your ass, and instead of lava it's black death diarrhea. Ass cannon.Did the see the film ""the decent"" because that's how you end up in the film ""the decent"".And... it'a a sewer discharge.Sweet. We had a cave at my school that we used to hang out at. It was awesome, and it went pretty deep. There were ropes set up to help you scale the rock walls. My DSLR equipped with a wide angle lens on it took a tumble in there and I never went back.I think it's called swimming when you're in the water, not hiking. 

Source: English degree holder. Who's swimming? I would like a clearer picture also with a form that includes a space to put my number.Sorta late to the party, but isn't it dangerous to break the surface of standing water in a cave (something about releasing trapped noxious gas into a enclosed area)?
Or am I mistaken (serious question, I have always been under the impression not to break the surface tension of a pool of water in a cave).Nice! I bet it looks cool to watch water shoot through the holes in the roof of that tidal cave when the waves come in! 

I'm in FL and there's something like that near where I live. It's really cool to look at, but people have died in there from waves bashing them against the rocks... and we have smaller waves than you do. 

Anyway, have fun, but check the surf report before you go in there again! Just mind the conditions and the tides and you'll be fine. :)

EDIT: Sorry, they CAN roar, but they generally do notI've posted this before, but... relevant-story-time!

TL;DR Came face to face with a tiger in Peninsular Malaysia, while walking alone through the forest at 10 o'clock at night.

I was on a trekking tour out in Taman Negara, Malaysia. ""Real Inner Jungle"" trekking, they called it - 2 hours upriver in a dugout canoe, 8 sweaty kilometers into the heart of the forest, staying the night in a big cave called Gua Besar (Malaysian for, you guessed it, ""big cave"").

We get to our stopping point that afternoon, drop our things off in the cave, and then head back outside to collect firewood. As we walk I ask our guide, Richard, what we'd be building the fire for, and he replies ""Oh, cooking."" And then, under his breath, ""...and protection...""

I overhear this last bit and laugh. ""Protection? Protection from what, TIGERS?""

Taman Negara is 43,000 square kilometers - roughly the size of New Hampshire and Vermont, put together - and the tiger population is thought to number less than 200. There's no way there are any tigers nearby that we would need to defend against.

And yet. Instead of laughing off my sarcasm, Richard wheels and glares at me. ""We do not,"" he hisses, ""make jokes about tigers. Especially not around the other tourists.""

Woof. Touchy.

We walk down a small path and split up to gather wood. Richard disappears from sight and when he comes back he has his armful of timber, but he's also wearing a troubled look on his face.

I ask him what's the matter, and at first he blows me off. But I, being nosy, press the point, and so he takes me aside and motions in the direction he just came from.

""Did you see that small cave back there, underneath our sleeping cave?""

Sure, what of it?

""Did you notice the smell?""

And now that he mentions it, there was a distinct musk to the area. I'd chalked it up to normal cave mustiness, but when I offer my hypothesis, he shakes his head.

""It's not the cave. Something's dead, inside. The cave is a den.""

I want to ask him what kind of den - what kind of animal, is it an active den, these kinds of things - but at this point the other tourists come back, and with a meaningful look Richard cuts our conversation short.

That evening we make a delicious batch of cave stew, plant candles all around the cave, and stoke up a nice crackler of a blaze, and people start to settle in for the night.

I, however, am antsy. I generally avoid tours, but I signed on to this one for the explicit purpose of night-walking in the ""real inner jungle."" I'd gone on nightwalks around HQ, and they yielded some cool animals (mouse deer, scorpions, flying lizards, etc), but generally the farther you get from civilization, the more you see. I wanted to find tapirs, pythons, maybe even elephants.

And so I said to Richard, ""Richard, I think I'm going to go on a night walk.""

He's surprisingly open to this, and says, ""Okay. But just stay in this area.""

And he points to a small patch of ground immediately outside the cave, 3 meters by 3 meters across and containing a single tree.

At this I laugh and shake my head. ""No, Richard, I mean a real night walk.""

He nods thoughtfully and then with great earnestness says, ""Okaynoproblem. I go with you!""

Which would be fine, but upon hearing that Richard is going, three giggly tourists decide to come along, as well. Our group can be heard for miles, and we don't see a damn thing.

After fifteen minutes Richard takes us back to the cave, and I again take him aside. ""Richard, you and I both know that was a really bad night walk. I think I'm going to go out, and this time, alone.""

Richard immediately shoots me down. ""NO! This is not like HQ, this is the real, inner jungle. Here there are leopards, and cobras, and TIGERS, and if you're in a group that's okay, but as one person they will wait for you in the trees, and watch you, and when you least expect it, they will pounce. You will get eaten.""

Okay, duly noted, but frankly I think Richard is a bit of a sensationalist.

So for ten minutes I reason with him, assuring him that I'm very observant, I've done his before, and the risk is very low. I wheedle, I cajole, and though he's not happy about it he eventually agrees - on the conditions that a) I only go out for forty minutes, and b) I take his machete with me.

His dull machete hardly posed a threat to the vegetables we chopped up for our stew that evening. If I actually needed to use it against an attacking animal, I think it would only be good for putting up a symbolic resistance. But okay, Richard, sure.

And so I walk out into the darkened jungle with a headlamp and a machete. It is 10PM. I turn left from the cave entrance, and for twenty minutes I prowl through the forest, sighting a mouse deer and an eight-inch spider along the way. Cool.

But soon enough my path has brought me back to the cave, and I still have another twenty minutes before I promised Richard I'd return. I peer off to the right, in the direction of the ""den,"" and with overconfidence borne of skepticism and an unhealthy feeling of invincibility, I tread off towards it.

I draw up right across from the den, and the odor is rank. I can't believe I thought that was a normal cave smell - there's definitely something rotting inside. But I shine my flashlight into the cave, and no one is home - either the den has been abandoned, or its resident is out for the night. I hope for the former.

In front of me, the path leads beyond the den, but I decide not to continue - if there is some predator living there, I don't want to get in between it and its home.

So instead I plant myself across from the entrance, and sweep my flashlight beam across the foliage.

Left... Right.... Left....

And suddenly, it's right there.

Fifteen meters in front of me, a pair of the biggest, brightest eyes I've ever seen flare up out of the darkness. They are bright yellow, they are the size of ping pong balls, and they don't shine so much as they glow.

I've seen my fair share of prey animals at night, and I know generally how they behave. Sambar deer, hogs, civet cats, they all startle and stare at you, transfixed in the beam, and when they run they do so noisily, frantically.

These eyes were not the eyes of a prey animal. These eyes scanned the forest slowly, with the cool malevolence of an animal that doesn't need to consider anything higher up on the food chain. These were the eyes of a predator.

Immediately I am drenched in sweat, and the machete is up in the air, its tip shaking uncontrollably. There is thick vegetation between me and the creature, and so I can't quite make out the body, but faintly, behind the glow of the eyes, I think I see stripes. If it is a tiger, 15 meters is nothing - it could be on me in an instant.

I stand stock-still, my heart pounding in my ears, watching as the eyes first scan one way, and then the other. And then in complete silence they turn, and the animal vanishes from sight.

Which is almost worse. Before, I knew where the animal was - now, it could very well be circling around, to ambush me from behind. I spin on my heel and I sprint harder than I've ever sprinted before, my bobbing light recalling a scene from The Blair Witch Project, the nighttime screeching of the cicadas doing nothing for my stress levels.

I don't slow until I'm well within our sleeping cave. Richard is up still, tending the fire.

""Richard..."" I pant, ""saw something... by the den... huge eyes... like a cat...""

He looks up at me, the look on his face equal parts concern and ""I told you so.""

""What color were the eyes?"" he asks.

""...yellow! ...bright yellow!""

He looks away into the fire, musing. ""Huh. Well, that... was probably a tiger.""

That night I move my sleeping bag as close to the interior wall of the cave as possible, and still I don't sleep a wink.

Two more details:
The next day, we walk a further 6 kilometers through the jungle, and met up with a boat waiting to take us back to HQ. Richard speaks with the boatman - a member of the local Orang Asli tribe - for a couple minutes and when he comes back, he looks a little traumatized.

""I just spoke with the boatman,"" he says, ""and the Orang Asli know that den. They say it used to be empty, but now there is a tiger living there - the biggest, oldest tiger they know of.""

Why do you take tourists to this place.

And back at the HQ, we chat with the manager, who finds the whole situation more humorous than he probably should.

""If it was a tiger,"" he told me, ""you didn't really need to worry. Generally, tigers will just play with you.""

What, like a cat plays with a mouse? Comforting. Truly, deeply comforting.

In any case, I survived to tell the tale. Was it 100% a certifiable tiger encounter? No, not 100%. But the facts all add up, and if you were there, you would think it a tiger, too.

And that, that was the last time I blew off a local guide's warnings as sensationalist.

EDIT: No picture proof from the encounter, alas. But [this is Richard and me from the following day](http://imgur.com/2Uo8JMx) - I asked him for a picture before we went our separate ways, and this is the pose he struck. He... may have harbored some resentment toward me for almost getting eaten on his tour. Note the dull machete. And the sweat.

Why, hello fellow Hendersonite.  Man that tank must be expensive as hell.My dog loves to stare at the fish in our pond. I would never get him out of there.I want something like this over my bed. I also want someone to come and clean the filters regularly because gross. And finally, I would like this all to be done for zero dollars. This means that your vet bills are too high. Fish tanks made into things that are not usually fish tanks tells me that I can't afford whatever they are selling.

I had to get a root canal at an endodontist, and I knew my wallet would be emptied as soon as I walked into the waiting room. They had about a dozen high-backed, winged, leather chairs and their counter was made out of a custom-built, 16 foot, salt-water fish tank full of tropical fish.

And yes, the procedure cost a hell-of-a-lotI imagine the fish are fascinated and terrified every time a behemoth appears beneath them and naps there. There are probably little fish professors who have studied the different breeds of dogs and teach all the little baby fish what each one is and what kind of diet it has.My dog's wet nose would smudge that glass up so fast...Damn it to hell, this could have been done spectacularly and humanely with tetras, corys, and small plecos.I would love to see how a dog reacts to being in this. I think my leo would have loved this.I think that's a fish tank/cat house!I feel like they replace those fish every week after they die from heart attacks.I haven't used the term ""neat-o"" in a long time. It totally applies here, so...

**Neat-o!**That would drive a cat fucking bonkers. That must be living hell for the fishLooks more like a -  cat torture chamber.Our cat would love it!!I would love 1 for my cats, too. I don't know if my dog would care, but my cat would move in and refuse to leave. Looks like that vet is rolling in cash.The problem with these guys is they are god awful at stocking tanks.

Edit: thanks for the encouraging words everyone! Astrophotography truly is my passion. AAAAND ridiculously expensive, so here's a particularly shameless plug for a way you could support me making astro-art for Reddit! Also, you'll end up with a professionally made print of a picture you love! 

My small humble online store: www.society6.com/marcleathamFinally some fucking color pics of the moon! We've been savages![Cropped and sized to 1920 x 1080.](http://imgur.com/Mjcgpo7)  

Hope you don't mind OP :)Does anyone else feel like it's spinning? I feel like it's spinning.Interestingly, the moon is pretty far from a mirror - it only reflects back 12% of the light that is cast on it. It just looks so bright because the sun is that much brighter. Compare that with various other extraterrestrial bodies like Encedalus, a moon of saturn, that is 99% reflective.

[Albedo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) - look in the section for Astronomical Albedo, which is also my band's name!Is it just me or is this picture have *depth?*. It doesn't seem flat; the moon looks and feels closer than the stars do, unlike all other moon pictures I have seen.

I love it!/r/astrophotographyThat's no moon. 
My bad, that's a moon.Just for reference - the Albedo is the measurement for reflected light from objects. Our moon reflects very little with an albedo value of 0.12 (0 is a body that absorbs all light, 1 reflects all light.) It would be a very poor mirror and that's a good thing otherwise we'd have dramatically different evenings based on the lunar phases.

[Here is a table of Albedo for celestial objects](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/A/Albedo)

Our moon is on par with Mercury, our ""dimmest"" local celestial body. (Sometimes Mercury is measured to be slightly lower at 0.11)

Venus however will glow brightly in the sky, even with only a small crescent in reflection. It's Albedo value is 0.75.

P.S. Gorgeous shot :)Thank you for this! This picture is truly spectacular. So, it is made of green cheese...Amazing picture. Making it my background :) Thanks so much for sharing it!I often wondered why moonlight, being reflected sunlight, didn't kill or harm vampires.Can someone ELI5: How is this coloring the way that the moon ""really"" is? Since color is just the result of bouncing light, wouldn't the way it looks usually be the way its color appears under a certain set of lighting circumstances, and this color be the way it appears under a different set?That's awesome, thank you for posting something to pics that isn't a sob story but actually a cool picture.

He looks like a Pixar character. Great shots!It was ""posing"" because people feed it. Unfortunately, many foxes are unafraid of approaching humans because people feed them. In the summer, when food is more plentiful, they stay away more. In the winter, they approach humans, looking for a handout, which too many people are willing to give them.

There's a lot of smoke and it really gets around.[deleted]As a mining engineering major, working in the coal industry, especially underground, is fucking scary.  One good example is in metal/non-metal mines (everything except coal), you wait it out in a refuge chamber if there's a disaster.

In coal, the procedure is to grab whoever you can and get the fuck as far away as humanly possible.  In coal, you spend your entire workday surrounded on all sides by material that will do its absolute best to set on fire.And this is how we contribute to raising global temperatures... Do you really want it hotter Australia, DO YOU?One article stated that the residents are gathering evidence for a class action suit against the company that owns the mine. How can you sue the company when an arsonist set fire to it??? Will this town end up like Centralia, Pennslvaniya? Morwell, Australia - The next Centralia, Pennsylvania.Morwell dweller here, the smoke is ridiculous for anyone wondering. It's been plaguing the town for weeks now and has resulted in some residents wearing masks similar to those worn in Japan. There's a constant burnt smell in the air which is accompanied by a smokey taste in the back of your mouth at all times. You'll find yourself coughing more than usual as well, I wish the damn thing would be defeated already.Not to worry. It's a clean coal fire. Not harmful to humans. One does not simply walk within 50ft of Mordor.Many thanks for the info. I will now be trying to contact my grandma to make sure she's going to evacuate until the smoke has cleared. So will this turn out like Centralia, Pennsylvania, and they will have to evacuate the town nearby eventually? Or is there any way to really put it out?

Most interesting thing after that is watching film of crashes currently versus crashes then.

Previously? Serious injuries and deaths every season. 

Now? A car crashes into a 10' thick barrier, and comes to pieces, leaving the driver pissed off, but ultimately unharmed in a shell of solid kevlar and what looks like goddamn kryptonite mixed with titanium.

Probably very high maintenance, thoughShe looks pretty young for an 89 year oldIf you've never seen old luxury cars like this in person, something that isn't captured in pictures is the size of them. I went to an exhibit in atlanta, and the first thing that struck me is how big they were. You would think they'd be fragile, but you could run a hummer off the road in some of these things. [Do you come with the car?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89hkmQKx9p4)This car is currently stored in the basement of the Peterson Automotive museum. It's beautiful in person. It was originally made by a coach builder, that's why it looks nothing like any other RR. 

It was found in a New Jersey junkyard sometime in the 50's, sent to Japan, then made its way back to the states. It's not actually recognized by Rolls Royce as an RR, due to the fact that its got a slanted grill, while all RR's have always had a grill that stands vertical. 

If you ever get the chance, check out the basement of the museum. It's better than anything they have on display. 

As a fan of all things automotive, we came out of the elevator, I looked to my left, and right there is this beauty. I started walking towards it, the tour guide had to stop me. It was the only thing I cared about. It truely is a work of art.

It is part of the private collection of the Peterson Auto Museum in Los Angeles, California. I don't remember the exact story behind it, but it was not a standard 1925 Rolls Royce Phantom.  I think it has a custom designed body that was built specifically for the owner at the time.  It was restored by the Peterson family and currently sits in the ""vault"" beneath the museum. It can be viewed however by paying  extra money for the guided tour instead of general admission. Not trying to be a dick, but this looks a lot different than this car

No sarcasm intended, I just wanted to see pictures of the interior of the posted car.So beautiful, so elegant. The curves so natural, the colors so sublime. Did I know beauty before now? Those trees, they... they complete me. The car and chick are cool too, but those trees...I would love to see Top Gear testing this car.This looks like the ultimate villain car.I can't shake feeling that if I step inside that car, I'm somehow betraying my country to a foreign-intelligence service.

He was just being efficient. i don't understand why the US doesn't implement a 25 cent deposit for cart use.  The rest of the world does and it works fine.

Plow drivers are on tight schedules to keep up with snow and don't have time to go pick up the carts or make the store do it.That looks incredibly satisfying.  I would probably find this immensely enjoyable.  I'm not sure what that says about me. :(Is that in Everett, MA?Sort of unrelated but still speaks to how much some of these stores care about carts: people frequently visit a grocery store near my shop and take their cart with them to the bus stop in front of my store. When the bus shows up, they roll the cart down my driveway into the my lot.

I usually collect the carts and put them up on the top of the slope where they are clearly visible from the grocery store. After a day or two and a complete absence of any attempt to collect them, I'll roll them back down the hill and toss them into my dumpster. I'd wager that store has lost at LEAST a hundred carts that way.Is it the plow driver at fault for plowing the carts into the snow? Or is it the store store managers fault for not getting the carts moved by the cart guy? Or is it the users of the cart for being ignorant ass morons for leaving the carts in the middle of the parking lot instead of taking the extra minute or so to return them to the cart return area?I blame the lazy fucks who don't put their carts away first, store second.

I felt bad for the plow drivers, as their hours were at least as long as ours with no company and absolutely no appreciation from the community at large.

   A - declare it's OK to leave your car there overnight, 
   B - reward you for being responsible.

Kudos to the Wolftrap.Holy crap.  Around here they are nice enough to tow your car...  This was the racket for a while.

About 2AM they bring tow trucks, then the cops wait down the road for people that panicked and drove home.  Fun fact, in this state you can tell a tow truck driver to put your car down if they are towing it.  If they argue, take a picture and get paid later.Not only do the idiots get punished, but the sensible people get rewarded. If only this happened more often. One of the dumbest things IMO, is the fact that people can get DUI's for sleeping in their car. I've known a few people who got charged like this, one was trying to sleep, and the other was just trying to charge their dead phone to call a cab.Parking is one of the biggest considerations I make whenever I move to a new town and need to pick a bar... ""Hey, I'd like to order another beer. But how's my car in the parking lot if I need to take a cab home?""

The answer to that question determines whether or not I'd be going back to that bar.What's to stop someone from just parking their car in that lot and going somewhere else?  Free food without the crushing hangover.Chickie and Petes a well known bar in Philadelphia actually has your car towed if it's left in the parking lot over night.  I had the privilege to experience this a few years back.  our local bars tow you then wonder why their bartenders get fined and cited when people get caught with a DWI. Its a big reason I will only drink at home.nice, here in buffalo you get towed or ticketed. guess they want me to drive hammered. in the United States or at least where I live you get your car towed which can cost you several hundred dollars to get outThis do this at a bar in my town but there's no free food. They just leave a number for a DUI service that drives your car hime for you or ask you to move it by 11 am. Like I would be awake by then to drive. LolThat's nice of them. My local bar cars the tow trucks and tows the cars illegally parked on their property in the morning. :(I've been there!! Not only does the bar actually put these on cars left in the parking lot, but the bar is really unique in its decor and atmosphere. Good old Edmond, OK! plot twist: smokey hasnt paid for lunch in months.It's even more sweet when the reason you left your car there was because you hooked up.This the bar in Edmond, OK? smart homeless people would just take them before the owner comes.That's awesome! Last time I did this, the cops ticketed me for an expired meter.And then they charge you for overnight parking Congratulations on using common sense...

Some future spacemen we are.Ghengis Khan wrote a book?Libraries are phasing this out. I miss these. It is like I am reading the book with all those people who came before me. That when I flip through the pages I inhabit the same space, the same story, all of us laughing or weeping as one. I makes me feel like for once, I don't venture through the world alone.It's always a little eerie to see something like that and think that you're holding the same book as someone who is long since six feet under. I heard of something like this but a little more eerie. In the book *In the Company of Heroes* Mike Durant talks about how he went to check out a book on the Medal of Honor, and the last person to check it out was a teenager named Gary Gordon years before. Gordon was one of the Delta snipers who gave his life to protect DurantAnd it's not just the books, but the library itself. 

The library is one of the few places where time slows down. You can look out the window and see life hustling along. Buildings rise and fall, cars look more modern with each passing year, clothing styles change. But in the library, you're among the past. Writers long since dead, telling stories that would be antiquated by our standards. 

The library is as close to my childhood as I can get. Posters encouraging reading, a card catiloge, ceiling fans that look way too old. And the library and it's books don't care to modernize. Everything is always looking for be fresh, new, happening. But books, with their faux plastic covers, their yellowed pages, their unknown authors. They want no part of this soceity. 

Sometimes when I feel there is nothing to hold on to, the library will slow things down and take me back to my childhood. I know most of what I'm saying will be lost on who ever reads this, but this is the realest shit I've said on reddit. I hope everyone can find the center, the thing that connects every road a person travels. And for me, it very well may be the library.

Thanks. They still have check out cards at your library?  I figured everyone went to bar codes by now.I never thought I would try to one-up someone over a library book.  So....here's a picture of the card from my borrowed library book, Argonauts of the South by Frank Hurley.  Judging from the prices on eBay, I am shocked that the library removed this from their stacks for me to bring home.

http://imgur.com/JmHouf7*Books: Sometimes they're really old and dead people have touched them.*When I was a kid in the late 60s, early 70s my dad used to take me to Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh every two weeks to check out books. The librarians sat in this raised glass booth to stamp the books. I love old libraries. And books. And I miss my dad :(In 20 years, we may see a repost of thisThis always brings me back to grade school. I went to a Catholic school when I was young,  staffed entirely by sisters and a sparse few volunteers. I remember our class going down to our dusty old library in the fourth grade so that Mother Superior could teach us what she called the most valuable skill we would learn: how to use a library. She lovingly took us and showed us everything; the card catalog, the check cards, Dewey decimal. She loved that library and spent most of her time down there,  helping the occasional student as it served the schools up through high school. She was always happy to help with homework, or help locate a book for anyone who needed it.

 Sadly, she is long gone, and much of the knowledge she worked so hard to pass to us is now irrelevant, which I think would sadden her more than anything. Whenever I see an old library check card it brings me back to that old building, thinking of myself probably reading The Adventures of Homer Price for the fourteenth time in the basement section where the windows gave just enough light I could see. I think I'll go and check out a new book tomorrow. Thanks for the memory, Op. I don't have a picture but in the 4th grade I borrowed a book and the last person to do so was my dad 40 years before by a week.OK OK, Lamb is the author and Genghis Khan is the subject, for a sec there I was like ""The Great Khan wrote a book!?!?!"" ""And it's *about lamb???*"""" Is it a cookbook?"" It all seemed oddly possible for a second.Frankly, that's the beauty of books. Being able to carry the thoughts and feelings of the author through the ages is a magnificent thing. It's still 2013?
Is the different world the 50's? Some 25 years ago, I checked out a 1846 illustrated edition of «*Les mémoires dEugène-François Vidocq*» Couldnt believe I could take this out of the library

Its something to hold a book that had been read by some 8 generations of readersGreat book, too.  I always enjoyed Harold Lamb.  He had a gift of making a historical period come alive.I found this giant 1000+ page Sherlock Holmes book one time in a library, and I decided I'll read the entire book. Turns out it's not just 1 story, it's all the newspaper articles put together into a book, and every ""chapter"" is just a new article entirely. The book was rather old as well, and the wording took some time to understand, but I loved it!For a second there I thought Genghis Khan wrote a book.I'm sad that they don't use checkout cards like this anymore.  They just scan the barcode and it posts to my account at the library, and they send me an email a couple days before it's due with a link to hit the website to extend the checkout period.

I liked seeing the history of the book being checked out.this might be weird... but omg i would have loved to smell that book!I remember awkwardly printing my name on those cards all through elementary school. Even more awkward when all the horse books had my name and the names of three other girls that loved horses over and over on the card over a span of four years. >.<I'm more amazed that the librarians still use those cards and ink stamps.

As he was signing, he said, ""I always feel weird signing the book. Tolkien was a genius and here I am putting my autograph under his name like I wrote the damn thing!"" He was a really awesome, humble guy.I know Sean has been in all these great movies, but I will forever remember him for [Toy Soldiers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103112/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_98). I watched it as a kid and it's one of those which just won't leave my memory.[Better Pic](http://imgur.com/mhCg3Mo)Ah, to be a ring bearerDoes he get to do this now? http://media1.giphy.com/media/zUZ0pvGMyNVqU/giphy.gifHe looks like E and turtle had a babyShe's 17*.

Also, from [his Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Astin#Personal_life), TIL:
> Astin has a tattoo on his ankle of the word ""nine"" written with the Tengwar script, commemorating his Lord of the Rings involvement and his character's membership in the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven of the eight other Fellowship actors (Elijah Wood, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom) all have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies' stunt double has the tattoo as well.


*^originally ^said ^she ^was ^18, ^but ^I ^was ^wrong.I've met a few notable people in my life, but I never got so starstruck as the day when I met Sean Astin. I was gonna play it cool and be natural, but when I shook his hand and made eye contact, it was like my whole childhood came flooding back to me. It was kind of overwhelming.

The whole time I'm sure he was like... ""Welp... here we go again.""God Sean Astin is HOT. 

I mean...... RUDY...

SHit I mean his daughter. Can someone tell me the age difference in both these pics?http://imgur.com/r0of14x

Here's something to think about.  I don't know how many shutter speeds the phone has, but based on the pixel distance between the ""peaks"" in the image, you could predict a set of vibration frequencies that the phone has.  If the picture still had its shutter speed meta data attached (which imgur scrubs), you could predict the exact frequency within a small tolerance.

Using that data and small survey of recent phones, you could probably predict which phone the picture taker has.

NSA, feel free to hire me at any time (you just have to find me)Not really sure why there are people calling bullshit on this - it's perfectly plausible since most phone cameras use a [rolling shutter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter), which effectively captures the image a line at a time going from the top to the bottom. The phone is not moving too fast relative to any one of these exposures, so the overall image is mostly crisp, but different lines are captured with the phone in different positions, leading to the vertical waviness.

As to whether OP took the picture, I don't see it on Google reverse image search, so it's no more or less plausible than anything else on reddit. Quit whining.I think that's what Gehry would have had it look like if he could have anyway.[Parallel Universal Studios](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0hy9nWtqE1rpavwao1_r3_500.gif)Michael J.

Haha.Twist: This is a picture from a regular camera. Op's phone is a nokia brick in his pocket. The vibrations were strong enough to warp space and time in his immediate vicinity.I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your phone may be on drugs. 

Has your phone's grades been slipping lately or has it been skipping classes? Perhaps hanging out with new phones who's numbers you don't know? Automatically erasing it's browser history? Charging home late? 

These are all warning signs. As a phone owner myself I feel it's important to spread the word about these things because it may be happening right in your pocket and you don't even realize. This is how phones break. *Please* OP, follow up on this with your phone. Even if it's not using drugs it can't hurt to ask.

I took the old doorbell off, connected the two wires from the house to two contacts inside the crosswalk housing, and presto, it worked!I deliver Pizzas. Some houses I have noticed have 2, and sometimes 3 buttons near or on their door. I press all the buttons and knock.

Is it me, or does that stick out way farther than normal? It looks like the button is on an extension compared to the ones around here. Been thinking about my doorbell ...Are you a bear?  Because you have the reflection of a bear.as a delivery driver, i never use the doorbell because im never actually sure if people hear it. Repeatedly slamming this button may actually decrease the wait time at the door, as opposed to the pedestrians who expect the light to change immediatelyThis is awesome. I'd use it normally, press it eleven times, till the light changes or door opens. Does it also say ""wait....wait....wait"" after you press it?I think we'd all like video, OP.  It would've been so much better if the arrow was pointing towards the door rather than the wall. That's still pretty awesome though, I would push the SHIT out of that button.I have a brass bell with a rope as a door bell. No one ever rings it. I installed a security cam a little while ago and watched while Jehovah Witnesses came to the door. One of the pulled on the rope, straight down, producing no sound.

We put in an aquarium and loaded up the top with books.  Next day is was gone, not only from the aquarium but from the classroom.  So it had to lift several books to get out of the aquarium, but we couldnt figure out how it got out the classroom.  We finally found a cut under the door only about 2x2 that it must have gone through. We saw it a couple days later and put it into a fenced cage with stone walls.  Next day it was gone.  We inspected the cage and finally found a loose piece of plywood at top of the wall, near the roof.  It had to climb a stone wall and pry open the plywood panel to get out.

Here is a pdf to help you  http://www.chickensforbackyards.com/media/ducklingcaresheet.pdf

also here's a link to a starter kit from Murray McMurray it will give you an idea of what you need http://www.mcmurrayhatchery.com/starter_kit.html

I should add that they recommend shavings. I wouldn't, not until they are about a week old at least. They tend to eat the tiny shavings and it contributes to pasty butt (their vent becomes caked and they can't poop) and keeps them from getting the nutrition they need. I would recommend just newspaper and papertowels for the first week at least until they begin to recognize food. 

Additionally this could be a wild duck if it is you might try a fish and wild life officer. Some places have rescues for wild animal rehab. Some won't bother for poultry though.

Seatwarmers.The first thought that came to my American mind was ""that's not the passenger seat""so, did it shit on your seat yet?Chilling on a heated seat??OP is about to find out that ducks don't have sphincter muscles.You should be careful about picking up strange ducks on the side of the road, ducks are famous for their penchant for rape.Meanwhile the duck police are still looking for Mrs. Ducks child that was abducted while playing outside.Great copilot! They're great until they remind you they do not have a sphincter muscle and shit all over the place. Way to go, god!GGG then...[one day](http://imgur.com/imlga)THIS ladies and gentlemen, is how you pick up chicks!

I'll show myself out. I rescued a Canada Goose gosling last spring from the freeway. I actually almost hit him and his brother ( they could have been female, I'm not sure. Him seemed to fit. ) I pulled over quickly and went to get them but the one got squished. I was crying while  I was running onto the road flagging down cars so they would stop. Finally got the other guy. Put him in a reusable grocery bag with a blanket at the bottom. Started to drive away and he started flipping out and jumping out of the bag. I ended up putting him under my shirt just so he would sit still while driving. He hung out with me at work and at my team practice that night. I ended up putting him in a small box I found with a blanket and some water in there. He hung out with me all night, I names him Jim ( he seemed to calm down when I started playing The Doors ) and got quite attached. If I left the room he would start freaking out. He was just awesome!!! He even started answering to my voice. 

 I took him to the Urban Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in my city. You should see if you have something similar in your area.

That duckling is going to poop on your seat, I guarantee it. Hey atleast you have a passenger to hang out with now.  Don't forget his seatbelt though He probably doesn't give very good advice yet does he?Where I come from it's illegal to pick up random chicks from the side of the road""wtf that's the driver's seat""

oh yeah, the UK and Australia existVolkswagen I wish I found a duck.  You lucky bastard.

In surface navigation, a cross sea is a sea state with two wave systems traveling at oblique angles. This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite a shift in wind. Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old, creating a shifting, dangerous pattern. Until the older waves have dissipated, they create a sea hazard among the most perilous.

A cross swell is generated when the wave systems are longer period swell, rather than short period wind generated waves.

That man is a mother fucking sweetheart.My respect for this man just went up 10,000%.This will get buried but here goes.

My fiance's brother has cerebral palsy. He can't walk, bathe himself, feed hi mself, and is hard to understand.

He has one huge love, wrestling. His favorite wrestler of course is John Cena. He has talked about how they are friends and everything when they have never met. John sent him an autograph picture and it means the world.

I love Trey. I wish he could have this experience but regardless of that the man has used his influence for good and I'm appreciative of that. Some people don't have the same advantages as others. Trey will never know what it is to have children or a wife and so much else. Thankfully though there are people like this that help make things better. I'm really thankful that he doesn't just use his celebrity status for personal gain but he really goes the extra mile. It could be for PR reasons only and that would be fine because he is still touching and influencing lives.My buddy is a chauffeur for a company in the  SF bay area and a lot of the WWE superstars are their clients when they come to town.

He's driven John Cena a couple times and he says he is one of the coolest people he's ever met.This is why I like John Cena the person, not the Character. 400+ wishes is amazing. Hilarious John Cena prank phone call, every time I see him I think of this.

*edit, proper names, grammar.At what speeds is refueling done with a helicopter?  

I always thought the maximum speed of helicopters was far lower than stall speeds of any large fixed wing aircraft.I would've loved being the driver in one of these humvees. This brings back nightmares from my childhood.

http://i.imgur.com/HPr7RfX.jpg

(For the curious: from *Top Gun* on the NES. The hardest part of the game was refueling, not blowing up bad guys).

Wait, how the hell do you hook up the fuel line to a helicopter? I've only ever seen this done on planes and they always come in from the top. Does the boom have enough lift to fly itself up and attach to the chopper?You must admit the U.S. Military is a sight to behold (others as well). I mean a plane refueling two helicopters in mid-flight towing four humvees. Then imagine we probably have the capability to do this scenario simultaneously a couple hundred times. Even then, it's still a small fraction of this military.

I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying it's alway good. I'm certainly not saying it's always bad either. This is the most powerful military force in the history of civilization. (It's certainly the most expensive).So much freedom in one picture./r/MilitarypornWRONG! Two Cargobobs and a Titan, dummy Here's [a picture of me (on the left) replacing the basket](http://i.imgur.com/ajFj9YH.jpg) on an ARS (Aerial Refueling Store).   These were used by S-3's but are now used by F/A-18 Super Hornets.

Essentially the ARS is an external fuel tank with all of the necessary plumbing and mechanisms to extend a refueling hose with drogue (basket) so that the Super Hornet can provide in flight refueling.  A typical ""tanker"" Hornet will have 1 ARS on the centerline pylon and 4 drop tanks (external fuel tanks) on the other pylons.  Total fuel capacity is around 36,000 lbs of fuel (IIRC, been a few years).I like the power series going on here.

Each humvee should be somehow towing two trailers and each trailer should be sporting a pair of truck nuts.My first thought was wondering if they are going to have scratched up paint jobs but they could have just put some rubber in-between or something.GTAV looks so real.I dont know if i am more impressed that the Stallions can fly that fast with  theirs loads or the Herc can fly slow enough to refuel themFormer USAF E-3 AWACS crewmember. Sitting in the back of the jet during in-flight refueling is like riding the world's worst roller coaster.The MH-53/CH-53 is so hardass it uses Humvees for Trucknuts. Using petroleum like a boss, Murica!!!This is epic. CH53 is a silly military machine. Can carry 8,000 lbs through the sky like it aint shit, the new one coming out (CH53K) can carry 35,000 lbs, which is about seven Chevy Suburbans.

Walmart is operating through extreme capitalism the way that communism was (in some ways) supposed to work.  This is The People's Macaroni and Cheese.  In the communist dystopia the idea is you don't have to advertise it somehow because it's the only choice.

Here the plainness *is* the advertising, you know it's the Walmart brand for the lack of branding and assume that it's the cheapest.its soylent blueWait, so now it's not ""the fancy colorful images are just used to trap you, it's corporate mind control!!!"". Now it's, ""oh man, this is so dystopian, they don't have colors or images."" 

You're paying for a cheaper generic brand. Those colorful images and fonts you see on boxes cost money. 
There is a similar thing in Austraila.

IGA Supermarkets have the Black and Gold label with most if the packet in yellow with black lettering and a small picture of the product.

Pic: http://users.tpg.com.au/pschamb/mlshbtaco.jpgThis is called no-brand, house brand or generic brand in the industry. Great way to save money if you're on a budget, as the quality is usually similar to branded goods.

Edit: Yes I know it's a debagged Nissan Micra, that's the point of No-brand. They don't actually make anythings themselves.Wal-Mart is pretty much a smaller version of so many dystopian uber corporations Or it looks just like generic products did years ago!

1. Design package
1. Use great cute baby photo

1. Some Douchbag Executive wants his Ugly Grandkid on the package
1. Designer (now soulless from experience) agrees.
1.

Biggest problem: The relative size of objects to the Milky Way (background) is wrong.

Almost every single one of these objects that was added in is larger than actual size relative to the background image. The exceptions are the small and large Magellanic clouds which are in the original image here: http://s5.goodfon.com/image/366279-5616x3653.jpg

Becoming a Chimera all begins with fertilization in the womb. Under normal conditions one sperm will fertilize one egg and go on to form a **zygote**: a single cell containing the genetic information from both parents. However every once-in-a-while you might get two eggs in the Fallopian tube, meaning you can have two zygotes forming at the same time; this is how paternal twins are conceived. Even more once-in-a-while-ish these zygotes (at this stage they would be more than one cell: a **blastocyst**) might fuse together; forming a clump of cells that's half genotype A and half genotype B. If the zygotes that fused had a different expression for a given trait (due to the random nature of which genes get passed on) - say hair colour, then the resulting organism would express each genotype in ""clumps"". Certain groups of cells would all grow hair and produce pigment of one colour, while other groups of cells would produce another colour, giving us a halloween coloured puppy :>.
